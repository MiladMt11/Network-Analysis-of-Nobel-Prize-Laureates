## Connectivity
In this section we would like to show how connected our network is. As part of measuring the network's connectivity, we have created three different plots, each representing a different piece of information about the network.

### Most Influential Laureates
First, let's take a look at who are the most influential laureates in our network. In order to accomplish this, we plotted the top 10 laureates with the highest degree in the network.

As it can be seen in the plot, almost all of the laureates shown in the plot, have won the award in one of the scientific categories. "United Nations" is also on the top ten list which is most likely because many laureates in the peace category are somehow related to this organization due to their activities, thus the number of connectios of this node is relatively high. Additionally, an organization such as United Nations could potentially have links to laureates in other categories as well.

### Connectivity Through Time
The goal of this part is to discuss the connectivity of the network for each year. The following plots are provided in this regard.

The first plot below represents the average degree for each year. Based on the plot, it's clear that four periods of time have the highest average degrees. In the first period, the prize was only awarded in two categories, Physics and Chemistry, which clarifies the noticable high average degree in the year 1918. Additionally, The laureates in these categories were "Max Planck" and "Fritz Haber" respectively who are both located in our network with a great amount of connectivity. The other three periods were 1962, 1954 and 1944. In each of these years, there was a laureate who is also listed among our top 10 most influential laureates with the highest degree, people like "Otto Hahn", "Linus Pauling" and "Max Born".

 The reason behind this might be that as we move forward in time, references to laureates who won the award in the past increase, consequently, the average degree in the years before 1965 is higher than in recent years.
