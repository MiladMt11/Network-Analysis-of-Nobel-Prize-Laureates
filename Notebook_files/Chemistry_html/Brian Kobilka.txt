                Introduction

                Complex organisms require a sophisticated communication network to main-
                tain homeostasis. Cells from different parts of our bodies communicate with
                each other using chemical messengers in the form of hormones and neu-
                rotransmitters. Cells process information encoded in these chemical messages
                using G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) located in the plasma membrane.
                GPCRs are also mediate communication with the outside world. The senses of
                sight, smell and taste are mediated by GPCRs. G protein coupled receptors (GP-
                CRs) are nature’s most versatile chemical sensors. There are over 800 GPCRs in
                the human genome and they respond to a broad spectrum of chemical entities
                ranging from photons, protons and calcium ions, and small organic molecules
                (including odorants and neurotransmitters), to peptides and glycoproteins.
                    The classical role of a GPCR is to detect the presence of an extracellular ago-
                nist, transmit the information across the plasma membrane, and activate a cyto-
                plasmic heterotrimeric G protein, leading to modulation of downstream effector
                proteins. Taking the human β2AR as an example, binding of adrenaline leads
                to activation of Gαs, stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, cAMP accumulation, PKA
                activation, and phosphorylation of proteins involved in cell metabolism (Fig. 1).
                However, a wealth of research has now demonstrated that many GPCRs have
                more complex signaling repertoires. For example, the β2AR couples to both Gαs
                and Gαi in cardiac myocytes (Xiao et al. 1999), and can also signal through MAP
                kinase pathways in a G protein-independent manner via arrestin (Azzi et al. 2003;

        Shenoy et al. 2006). Similarly, the process of GPCR desensitization involves mul-
        tiple pathways, including receptor phosphorylation events, arrestin-mediated
        internalization into endosomes, receptor recycling and lysosomal degradation.
        These activities are further complicated by factors such as GPCR oligomerization
        (Terrillon and Bouvier 2004), localization to specific membrane compartments,
        and resulting differences in lipid bilayer composition. Such multifaceted func-
        tional behavior has been observed for many different GPCRs.
            How does this complexity of functional behavior reconcile with the bio-
        chemical and biophysical properties of GPCRs? The effect of a ligand on the
        structure and biophysical properties of a receptor, and thereby the biological
        response, is known as the ligand efficacy. Natural and synthetic ligands can be
        grouped into different efficacy classes (Fig. 1 inset): full agonists are capable of
        maximal receptor stimulation; partial agonists are unable to promote full activity
        even at saturating concentrations; neutral antagonists have no effect on signal-
        ing activity, but can prevent other ligands from binding to the receptor; inverse
        agonists reduce the level of basal or constitutive activity below that of the unli-
        ganded receptor. For GPCRs capable of coupling to multiple signaling systems,

                specific ligands can have different relative efficacies towards the different path-
                ways. In the extreme case, even opposite activities towards different signaling
                pathways are observed: for the β2 adrenergic receptor (β2AR), a partial agonist
                toward the arrestin/MAP kinase pathway are also inverse agonists for the classi-
                cal Galphas/cAMP/PKA pathway (Azzi et al. 2003; Wisler et al. 2007).
                    Given the central role played by GPCRs in nearly all physiological processes,
                they represent the largest group of targets for drug discovery for a broad spec-
                trum of diseases. A better understanding of the structural basis for the complex
                signaling behavior of GPCRs should lead to more efficient and economical ap-
                proaches to drug discovery.


                Early insights into GPCR structure

                First insights into GPCR structure came from the sequencing of rhodopsin and
                cloning of the β2AR and other GPCRs in the 1980s. My research career in this
                field began in 1984 when I joined the laboratory of Dr. Robert Lefkowitz. As a
                postdoctoral fellow in the Lefkowitz laboratory, I was involved in the cloning
                of the β2AR (Dixon et al. 1986). This was the first look at the primary amino acid
                sequence of a GPCR activated by a diffusible ligand (hormone or neurotransmit-
                ter). At the time we were surprised by the sequence homology with rhodopsin.
                However, this comparison and insights from the cloning of other GPCRs that
                soon followed confirmed the seven transmembrane topology to be a signature
                of GPCRs.
                     My first efforts to understand the structural basis of β2AR function took ad-
                vantage of having access to other adrenergic receptors that we had cloned.
                Generating chimeric receptors composed of different combinations of se-
                quence from β2AR and α2AAR allowed us to identify domains involved in ligand
                binding and G protein coupling specificity (Kobilka et al. 1988). After I started
                my lab at Stanford University at the end of 1989 we continued to refine the
                map of functional domains through a series of studies using chimeric receptors
                and site-directed mutants (Suryanarayana et al. 1991; Guan et al. 1992; Suryana-
                rayana and Kobilka 1993) these studies also identified intramolecular contacts
                that helped define the arrangement of transmembrane segments in the lipid
                bilayer (Mizobe et al. 1996).
                     Realizing the limitations of mutagenesis to define protein structure, I be-
                gan to explore methods for the large-scale production and purification of the
                β2AR to enable the use of biophysical methods to study receptor structure and
                the conformational changes involved in receptor activation. The β2AR was an
                ideal model system for these studies because of the existing wealth of structural

        information from mutagenesis studies and the rich diversity of commercially
        available ligands for this receptor (agonists, partial agonists, neutral antagonists,
        and inverse agonists). Nevertheless, this effort was particularly challenging be-
        cause of the inherent problems associated with expression and purification of
        these relatively unstable membrane proteins.
             Initial work focused on understanding β2AR biosynthesis in an effort to
        identify factors that might facilitate large-scale production (Kobilka 1990). The
        β2AR is a type IIIb membrane protein and lacks a cleavable signal sequence. We
        found that insertion of a cleavable signal sequence from influenza hemaglutinin
        improved insertion of the amino terminus and transmembrane segment (TM)
        1, and enhanced functional expression in insect cells by two-fold (Guan et al.
        1992). Using this modification, together with affinity tags at the amino and car-
        boxyl terminus, we established a protocol to express and purify sufficient quan-
        tities of β2AR for biophysical studies (Kobilka 1995).
             In 1993, Ulrik Gether and Sansan Lin joined the lab and began applying fluo-
        rescence spectroscopy and other biochemical and biophysical approaches to
        characterize β2AR structure and conformational changes in response to binding
        of various ligands. Using relatively simple techniques such as circular dichro-
        ism and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence gave us insights into the biochemical
        behavior of the β2AR that would ultimately be important for crystallography,
        such as the stabilizing effect of ligands, particularly antagonists and inverse ago-
        nists (Lin et al. 1996). By labeling the β2AR with small, environmentally sensitive
        fluorescence probes we were able to observe structural changes in response to
        agonist binding (Gether et al. 1995; Gether et al. 1997; Gether et al. 1997).
             These initial studies led to a series of experiments using fluorescence spec-
        troscopy to characterize the mechanism of agonist binding and activation.
        These experiments focused primarily on transmembrane segment (TM) 6 which
        earlier experiments suggested underwent the largest structural changes upon
        agonist binding. Purified β2AR was labeled at the cytoplasmic end of TM6 with
        a small environmentally sensitive fluorescent probe. By monitoring changes in
        the fluorescence as a function of time, we observed that the agonist binding
        and activation occurred through at least one conformational intermediate, and
        that agonists and partial agonists stabilize distinct states (Ghanouni et al. 2001;
        Swaminath et al. 2004; Swaminath et al. 2005). We also observed that agonists
        alone do not stabilize a single active conformation (Ghanouni et al. 2001). As a
        result of these findings, together with a growing body of evidence for ligand-
        specific signaling behavior in cells, GPCRs were no longer thought to behave
        as simple two-state switches. Rather, they are more properly thought of as mo-
        lecular “rheostats,” able to sample a continuum of conformations with relatively

                These biophysical and functional experiments suggested that chemical interac-
                tions between a ligand and a receptor led to the stabilization of a ligand-specific
                conformation or ensemble of conformations that interact with specific cytoplas-

                The first insights into the three dimensional structure of GPCRs came from rho-
                dopsin, which differs from most other GPCRs in its relatively high biochemical
                stability and its natural abundance in a native tissue, bovine retina. Gebhard
                Schertler’s lab provided the first structures of rhodopsin from two-dimensional
                crystals generated in lipids from rod outer segment membranes (Unger et al.
                1997). This structure revealed the general architecture of the seven transmem-
                brane (TM) helices, and was the basis for most GPCR homology models until
                Okada and Palczewski (Palczewski et al. 2000) obtained the first high-resolu-
                tion three-dimensional structure of rhodopsin in 2000. The elegantly simple
                approach developed by Okada for purifying rhodopsin from rod outer seg-
                ments using only detergent extraction suggested that lipids extracted with
                rhodopsin might be important for protein stability and/or crystallogenesis
                (Okada et al. 2000). More recently, Ernst and Hoffman produced the first active
                state structures of opsin from native rhodopsin (Park et al. 2008; Scheerer et al.
                2008).
                     In contrast to rhosopsin, GPCRs for hormones and neurotransmitters are not
                expressed in tissues at sufficient levels for biophysical studies and are much less
                stable when extracted from membranes with detergents. Nevertheless, through
                incremental improvements in insect cell expression and the efficiency of the pu-
                rification procedure we were able to produce sufficient quantities of β2AR (1–10
                milligrams) to start crystallography trials around 1998. However, it wasn’t until
                2004 that we obtained the first crystals of the β2AR large enough to examine by
                X-ray diffraction. These crystals were still very small (<50 microns) and we were
                not able to see diffraction at conventional synchrotron beamlines. I showed a
                picture of these crystals to Gebhard Schertler, who was working with Christian
                Riekel and Manfred Burghammer at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facil-
                ity (ESRF) in Grenoble to develop a microfocus beamline. Gebhard invited me
                to bring some of our β2AR crystals to the ESRF. Using a high intensity 5 micron
                beam, we were able to see diffraction compatible with a protein crystal at a
                resolution of approximately 20Å. While we were disappointed in the poor qual-
                ity of the diffraction, we were encouraged by the fact that we were able to form

        crystals of the β2AR. This was an important milestone in the effort and suggested
        that a crystal structure of the β2AR was not an impossible goal.
             In 2005 Dan Rosenbaum and Søren Rasmussen, two very talented and in-
        trepid postdoctoral fellows, joined the crystallography effort. Based on our
        experience at that time, we speculated that there were two impediments to
        crystallography: the dynamic character of the protein, and the very small polar
        surface area available for crystal lattice contacts. Our biophysical and biochemi-
        cal studies had suggested that the β2AR was a flexible, dynamic protein with
        the cytoplasmic ends of TM5 and TM6, and the intervening third intracellular
        loop as being the most flexible. We speculated that the dynamic character of
        this region of the receptor led to conformational heterogeneity that prevented
        the formation of well-ordered crystals. At the same time, biochemical studies
        showed that the largest stretches of polar amino acids were largely unstruc-
        tured and not suitable for forming crystal lattice contacts. Søren and Dan took
        two different approaches to address these problems and to generate better
        quality crystals of the β2AR. Søren identified a monoclonal antibody fragment
        (Fab) that bound to the cytoplasmic ends of TM5 and TM6. This antibody came
        out of a collaboration I initiated in 2003 with Dan Rohr at Medarex, a company
        specializing in therapeutic antibodies. The goal of the collaboration was to gen-
        erate antibodies that recognized a three-dimensional epitope on native β2AR for
        use in crystallography. As an immunogen, I prepared purified β2AR reconstituted
        into phospholipid vesicles to maintain its native conformation. We obtained 13
        different monoclonal antibodies from Medarex, and Søren and colleagues in the
        lab subsequently identified one that bound only to native β2AR and localized its
        binding site to a region between TM5 and TM6 (Day et al. 2007).
             As an alternative strategy, Dan used protein engineering to replace the same
        flexible, dynamic region of the β2AR between TM5 and TM6 of the β2AR with T4
        lysozyme (T4L) (Rosenbaum et al. 2007). T4 lysozyme was chosen because it is
        a very stable and highly crystallizable soluble protein with amino and carboxyl
        termini well positioned to fit between TM5 and TM6.
             Both approaches were designed to minimize conformational flexibility, or
        at a minimum, mask the most dynamic surface of the receptor and at the same
        time increase the amount of polar surface area available for forming crystal lat-
        tice contacts. During 2006 we obtained crystals using both approaches com-
        bined with a lipid-based media known as bicelles (consisting of a mixture of
        lipid and detergent) that had been shown to be suitable for membrane protein
        crystallization(Faham and Bowie 2002). Initial crystals of the β2AR-Fab and the
        β2AR-T4L fusion protein complex both diffracted to below 4 Å. We subsequently
        obtained a 3.4Å structure of the β2AR-Fab complex grown in bicelles (Rasmussen

                et al. 2007). This was our first look at the three dimensional structure of the β2AR,
                but a higher resolution structure would soon follow (Fig. 1A).
                    In the fall of 2006 we sent purified β2AR-T4L complex to Vadim Cherezov in
                the lab of Raymond Stevens at Scripps. Vadim had trained with Martin Caffrey
                at the Ohio State University. Martin’s lab had recently developed miniaturized,
                high-throughput methods for lipidic cubic phase (LCP) crystallography (Cheng
                et al. 1998; Misquitta et al. 2004). We previously explored the use of LCP meth-
                ods to crystallize the β2AR in 1999 in collaboration with Peter Nollert; however,
                at that time the methods were very labor intensive and used relatively large
                amounts of protein to screen very few conditions. The methods developed
                in Martin’s lab together with the robot built by his team enabled screening of
                thousands of conditions with a few milligrams of protein (Cherezov et al. 2004).
                Vadim had recently joined the Stevens lab, bringing with him an LCP robot on
                loan from Martin Caffrey. This collaboration led to a 2.4 Å structure of the β2AR-
                T4L complex (Cherezov et al. 2007; Rosenbaum et al. 2007) (Fig.2B). The fusion
                protein strategy developed for the β2AR has since been successfully applied
                to a growing number of other GPCRs. Through collaborative efforts with sev-
                eral other groups, my lab recently used the same fusion protein approach to

        determine structures of the M2 and M3 muscarinic receptors (Haga et al. 2012;
        Kruse et al. 2012), the mu and delta opioid receptors (Granier et al. 2012; Manglik
        et al. 2012), and the protease activated receptor PAR1(Chung et al. 2013). More
        recently we have found that fusing T4L to the amino terminus of the β2AR and
        simply deleting most of the third intracellular loop can also facilitate crystalliza-
        tion (Zou et al. 2012).
            Another approach that has succeeded in obtaining GPCR crystal structures
        involves scanning mutagenesis to identify thermostabilizing mutations. Chris
        Tate and Gebhard Schertler and their colleagues pioneered this approach to
        obtain the structure of the avian β1AR (Warne et al. 2008). These stabilizing mu-
        tations may reduce structural flexibility and permit the use of detergents having
        a smaller micelle size. This approach has also been used to obtain the structure
        of the adenosine A2A receptor (Lebon et al. 2011) and, in combination with a T4
        lysozyme fusion protein strategy, the neurotensin receptor (White et al. 2012).


        Capturing active states by crystallography

        Immediately after obtaining these initial inactive-state structures of the β2AR we
        initiated efforts to capture actives states by crystallography. Using the methods
        that were successful in obtaining inactive-state structures, we were not able to
        obtain crystals of a β2AR bound to an agonist. Our concern was that due to
        the relatively low affinity of agonists (when compared to the very high affin-
        ity inverse-agonist carazolol used to obtain inactive-state structures), we had
        incomplete occupancy of the receptor under crystallography conditions. This
        would lead to conformational heterogeneity. To overcome this problem, Dan
        Rosenbaum worked with Ralph Holl and Peter Gmeiner (University of Erlangen)
        to develop a covalent agonist for the β2AR. Using this approach they were able
        to obtain crystals of the covalent agonist bound β2AR; however, the cytoplas-
        mic face of the receptor was indistinguishable from the inactive-state structure
        (Rosenbaum et al. 2011).
             These disappointing results were consistent with what we had learned from
        earlier biophysical studies, that agonists alone do not fully stabilize the active
        state of the β2AR. This was first observed using fluorescence spectroscopy (Gha-
        nouni et al. 2001; Yao et al. 2009) and confirmed in more recent studies using
        NMR spectroscopy (Nygaard et al. 2013). Figure 3 is a cartoon illustrating the
        dynamic character of the receptor, showing that the receptor exists as an en-
        semble of conformations. Due to the flexibility of the unliganded β2AR, a small
        population can be in an active conformation, accounting for the phenomenon
        of basal activity. On binding the agonist, the cytoplasmic interface becomes

                a ligand, the G protein coupling interface of the receptor exists in an ensemble of
                predominantly low energy conformations. Rare active-state conformations are respon-
                sible for basal activity. Agonist binding increases the dynamic properties of the β2AR,
                increasing the probably of active-state conformations. Only G protein binding can fully
                stabilize the active state.



                even more dynamic, sampling a broader spectrum of conformations. This con-
                tributes to the challenges in crystallizing agonist-bound receptor. Fluorescence
                and NMR experiments showed us that stabilization of the active state required
                that the receptor must form a complex with its G protein, or some other protein
                that binds to and stabilizes the active conformation (Yao et al. 2009; Nygaard et
                al. 2013).
                     Our efforts to crystallize the β2AR-Gs complex were in progress, but not
                yet successful. As an alternative we were exploring antibodies and other bind-
                ing proteins. In May of 2009 I had the good fortune to meet Jan Steyaert (Free
                University of Brussels) at a Gordon Conference in Italy. Jan was pioneering the
                application of single-chain camelid antibody fragments, known as nanobodies,
                as facilitators of protein crystallogenesis. Shortly after the conference I sent Jan
                purified, agonist-bound β2AR reconstituted into phospholipid vesicles for im-
                munizing llamas. By November 2009 we had our first nanobodies and Søren
                Rasmussen identified one that exhibited G protein-like properties. This nano-
                body (Nb80) bound to purified β2AR and allosterically enhanced agonist bind-
                ing affinity by 100-fold, similar to what is observed in a β2AR-Gs complex. This
                β2AR-Nb80 complex gave us the first picture of the active-state conformation of
                the β2AR (Rasmussen et al. 2011) (Fig. 4A).

        The β 2 AR-Gs Complex

        In 2005 I met Roger Sunahara (University of Michigan) at a Gordon Conference
        and we began working together to understand the structural basis of coop-
        erative interactions between the β2AR and its G protein Gs. Our long-term goal
        was to crystallize the β2AR-Gs complex. The ultimate success of this effort would
        require an extensive network of collaborations with investigators from diverse
        disciplines.
            One of the most important contributions to this effort was the use of single
        particle electron microscopy (EM) to provide structural insights that guided our
        crystallization strategy. By 2009 Søren Rasmussen in my lab and Brian Devree in
        Roger’s lab were making considerable progress on the biochemistry of the com-
        plex. They were able to form a relatively stable β2AR-Gs complex that migrated
        as a single peak by size exclusion chromatography; however we were not able
        to grow crystals. We sent protein to Georgios Skiniotis, an expert in single parti-
        cle EM methods at the University of Michigan. Our first view of the β2AR-Gs com-
        plex came from a low-resolution structure generated from negative stained EM
        images. This structure revealed an unexpected feature of the complex that was
        one of the biggest obstacles to crystal growth. The Gαs subunit is composed
        of an alpha helical domain and a Ras-like domain with the GCP binding pocket
        at the interface. The EM structure revealed that the alpha helical domain of the

                Gs alpha subunit was conformationally heterogeneous. Subsequent EM studies
                helped to identify chemical additives that minimized the conformational het-
                erogeneity, as well as a nanobody (Nb35) that stabilized the complex.
                     Other contributions to the success of the β2AR-Gs crystallogrphy include the
                identification of an ultra high affinity agonist (BI-167107) from Boehringer Ingel-
                heim. This agonist has a dissociation half-life of more than 30 hours, ensuring
                that the β2AR would be occupied by an agonist at all times. Another important
                reagent was a new detergent, MNG-3, provided by Pil Seok Chae and Sam Gell-
                man at the University of Wisconsin, Madision (Chae et al. 2010). This detergent
                stabilized the β2AR-Gs complex during incorporation into the mesophase lipid
                used for crystallography. Martin Caffrey provided a special mesophase lipid (7.7
                MAG) that enabled the application of lipidic cubic phase methods to a large
                protein complex (Misquitta et al. 2004). To further stabilize the β2AR-Gs complex,
                we worked with Jan Steyaert to develop a nanobody (Nb35) that bound to the
                interface between the alpha and beta subunits of Gs. Finally, replacement of the
                amino terminus of the β2AR with T4 lysozyme facilitated packing interactions
                with the extracellular surface.
                     The first crystals of the β2AR-Gs complex were obtained in April 2011 and
                we were ultimately able to solve the structure to 3.2Å (Fig. 4B) (Rasmussen et
                al. 2011). The structure revealed how the binding of a small agonist at the ex-
                tracellular side of the receptor propagates structural changes across the lipid
                bilayer to effect activation of a cytosolic G protein. In this process, small struc-
                tural changes around the binding pocket are amplified to very large structural
                changes in the G protein.
                     Figures 5–8 follow the process of activation from agonist-stabilized changes
                in the β2AR to receptor mediated changes in Gs. As shown in Figure 5, structural
                differences between the inactive and active state β2AR structures are relatively
                small, particularly around the ligand binding pocket. The largest changes are ob-
                served at the cytoplasmic surface including a 14Å outward movement of TM6.
                     Fig. 6 compares the ligand binding pockets for active and inactive struc-
                tures. Amino acids within 4Å of the agonist BI167107 are shown. Changes in the
                binding pocket are relatively subtle, with the agonist pocket being smaller than
                that of the inverse agonist bound receptor. The largest difference is a 2Å inward
                movement around Ser207 in TM5. Ser203, 204 and 207 have previously been
                shown to be important for agonist binding and activation.
                     To understand how these small changes in the binding pocket contrib-
                ute to the larger 14Å movement at the cytoplasmic end of the receptor, we
                looked for the changes in packing interactions between TM segments below
                the ligand binding pocket. As shown in Figure 7, a set of conserved amino acids

                inward movement of TM5 and requires a rearrangement to accommodate the
                agonist bound active state (Fig. 7B). This rearrangement involves a rotation of

                the crystal structure of the Gi heterotrimer. The Gαs subunit is composed of a
                Ras-like GTPase domain and an α-helical domain. The GDP binding site occupies
                the interface between these two domains. On coupling to the β2AR. the Gαs
                subunit undergoes large structural changes, with the α-helical domain being
                displaced by approximately 130º. The carboxyl terminal α5-helix of the Ras-like
                domain is displaced 5Å into the core of the active receptor, stabilizing the active
                state of the receptor. This displacement of the α5-helix as well as more subtle
                changes transmitted from the receptor to the GDP binding pocket through the

        β1-strand of the Ras domain are responsible for dissociation of GDP. The empty-
        state β2AR-Gs complex is poised for activation by GTP. The very large displace-
        ment of alpha helical domain was not expected from prior studies; however,
        as noted above, low-resolution single particle EM studies by Georgios Skiniotis
        revealed that the alpha helical domain is highly dynamic.


        Conclusions

        The β2AR–Gs complex crystal structure provides the first high-resolution view
        of transmembrane signaling for a GPCR. We now have a framework to design
        experiments to investigate the mechanism of complex formation, GTP binding
        and complex dissociation. Of particular interest will be studies designed to de-
        termine the functional significance of the large movement of the Gαs α-helical
        domain relative to the Ras-like domain that is observed in the β2AR–Gs complex.
        Nevertheless, the β2AR-Gs structure leaves an important question unanswered.
        It does not explain why the β2AR preferentially couples to Gs. While some of the
        β2AR sequences involved in the β2AR-Gs interface have been shown to have a
        role in G protein coupling; there is no clear consensus sequence for Gs-coupling
        specificity when these segments are aligned with other Gs-coupled GPCRs.
        Coupling specificity may be dictated by interactions between the β2AR and
        Gs that precede the formation of the nucleotide-free complex. While the stud-
        ies outlined in this lecture have advanced the field, much work remains to be
        done before we can fully understand and pharmacologically control signaling
        by these fascinating membrane proteins.
