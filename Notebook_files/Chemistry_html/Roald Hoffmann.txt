R. B. Woodward, a supreme patterner of chaos, was one of my teachers. I
dedicate this lecture to him, for it is our collaboration on orbital symmetry
conservation, the electronic factors which govern the course of chemical reac-
tions, which is recognized by half of the 1981 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. From
Woodward I learned much: the significance of the experimental stimulus to
theory, the craft of constructing explanations, the importance of aesthetics in
science. I will try to show you how these characteristics of chemical theory may
be applied to the construction of conceptual bridges between inorganic and
organic chemistry.

FRAGMENTS

Chains, rings, substituents - those are the building blocks of the marvelous
edifice of modern organic chemistry. Any hydrocarbon may be constructed on
paper from methyl groups, CH3, methylenes, CH2, methynes, CH, and carbon
atoms, C. By substitution and the introduction of heteroatoms all of the
skeletons and functional groupings imaginable, from ethane to tetrodotoxin,
may be obtained.
   The last thirty years have witnessed a remarkable renaissance of inorganic
chemistry, and the particular flowering of the field of transition metal organo-
metallic chemistry. Scheme 1 shows a selection of some of the simpler creations
of the laboratory in this rich and ever-growing field.
   Structures l-3 illustrate at a glance one remarkable feature of transition
metal fragments. Here are three iron tricarbonyl complexes of organic moie-
ties - cyclobutadiene, trimethylenemethane, an enol, hydroxybutadiene -
which on their own would have little kinetic or thermodynamic stability. Yet
complexed to Fe(CO) 3 these molecules are relatively stable, they exist in a
bottle. The inorganic fragment is not merely a weakly attached innocent
bystander. It transforms essentially and strongly the bonding relationships in
the molecule.
   Structures 4-6 contain the ubiquitous cyclopentadienyl (Cp) ligand, two of
them in the archetypical ferrocene, one in CpMn(CO)3, two bent back in
C p2Ti(CO) 2. Structures 7-9 introduce us to the simplest representatives of
the burgeoning class of clusters-assemblages of two or more metal atoms
embellished with external ligands.

   If we seek order, unity, a way of thinking about these complexes it is not
difficult to perceive that the molecules contain as building blocks transition
metal-ligand fragments, ML n , such as M(C0) 5, M(CO) 4, M(CO) 3, MCp. It
must be said immediately that there is nothing special about the carbonyl
ligand. It is merely a representative and common component of organometallic
complexes. Phosphines, olefins, alkyls will do as well.
   To reconstruct the complexes l-9, we need to know the electronic structure
of the fragments. For the simple qualitative picture of the bonding in these
molecules that we seek, we do not need to know every last detail of the
electronic structure of each molecule. It will suffice that we know the frontier
orbitals of the fragments - the higher occupied and the lower unoccupied
levels - in other words the valence active orbitals of each fragment. It is K.
Fukui who taught us the importance of the frontier orbitals. We shall soon see
that it is the resemblance of the frontier orbitals of inorganic and organic
moieties that will provide the bridge that we seek between the subfields of our
science.
   Over the last eight years my coworkers and I have built up a library of the
orbitals of MLn fragments. (l-3) We have done so using entirely qualitative,
approximate molecular orbital calculations of the extended Hückel type (a
procedure for its time, developed with another of my teachers, W. N. Lips-
comb) and symmetry arguments (the value of which I first learned from still
another of my teachers, M. P. Gouterman). Molecular orbital theory, R. S.
Mulliken’s great contribution to chemistry, is fundamental to our approach, be
it in the construction of the very orbitals of the fragments, their changes on
molecular deformations, or the interaction of several such fragments to restore

the composite molecule. Yet when I seek the simplest of all possible ways to tell
you of the orbitals of these fragments, I am led back to the valence bond picture
introduced into chemistry by L. Pauling. (4)
   Let us go back to the building blocks. The common fragments MLn, 10-13,
may be viewed in many ways. One convenient approach is to see them as pieces
of an octahedron. This is quite analogous to perceiving CH 3, CH2, and CH in
a tetrahedron. If not a unique viewpoint, it is a useful one. Given that we have
an octahedron, or pieces thereof, let us prepare the metal atom for octahedral
bonding, and then bring in the appropriate number of ligands.




  The valence orbitals of the transition metals are nd, (n+l) s and (n+l) p,
with n=3, 4, 5. To prepare the metal atom for bonding we must form six
equivalent octahedral hybrids. This is accomplished, 14, by using all of the s
and p functions and two of the d’s. Three d functions, d xz, dxy, and dyz, are left
unhybridized. They may be described, and we will do so often, as the t2g set of
the crystal field, ligand field, or molecular orbital theories of an octahedral
complex. (5)




   To form an octahedral complex we would bring in six ligands to make use of
the six octahedral hybrids. Perhaps it is appropriate to digress here and make
clear our ligand convention, which is to consider the ligand always as an even
electron Lewis base. While acceptor character or Lewis acidity is a desirable
feature in a ligand, Lewis basicity or donation is essential. We see the basicity
in the lone pairs of CO, PH3, and CH 3-15-17, in bidentate four-electron
ligands, be they ethylenediamine 18, or butadiene 19, or in the electronically
tridentate C 5H 5-, C p-20, the equivalent of three two-electron bases. (6)


                                                                           37




   Let six two-electron ligands approach the metal atom prepared for octahe-
dral bonding, 2 1. Sizable overlaps lead to formation of strongly metal-ligand
   bonding combinations, and their strongly metal-ligand                 coun-
terparts. The six electron pairs of the ligands enter the six bonding combina-
tions. Any electrons the metal contributes enter the t 2g orbital left behind.


38                                Chemistry 1981


Indeed, for Cr(CO)6 with its 6 metal electrons we attain a nice closed shell
configuration, a situation we have learned to associate with relative kinetic and
thermodynamic stability in organic chemistry.
  What if we have not six ligands coming in, but only five? This situation is
depicted in 22. Five hybrids interact strongly, are removed from the frontier
orbital region, just as all six were in 21. One hybrid, the one pointing toward




where the ligands are not, remains roughly untouched, relatively low-lying in
energy. The frontier orbitals, enclosed in a dashed box in 22, now contain the
t2g set plus one hybrid.
    What if we have four ligands, ML4 or three, ML3? Much the same things
happens. In ML 4 two hybrids are left behind, in ML3, three. We have thus
reached the simplest of all possible pictures of the electronic structure of the
ML n fragments with N = 5, 4, 3, namely that given in 23-25. The ML n


                                     R. Hoffmann                                  39


fragment’s frontier orbitals consist of the descendants of an octahedral t 2g set at
relatively low energy, and above them 6-n (one for n = 5, two for n = 4, three
for n = 3) hybrids pointing toward the missing octahedral vertices.
   What remains is to decide how many electrons to place into these frontier
orbitals, and here the ever-useful Mendeleev Table, modified in 26 for electron
counting purposes, tells us that Fe in oxidation state zero will have eight
electrons in Fe(CO) 4 or Fe(CO) 3, and so will Co(I), or Ni(II).




   The reader had best beware. The account given here is simplified, as much
as I dare simplify it. In that process, perforce, is lost the beautiful detail and
complexity that makes Fe(CO) 3 different from FeCl 33-. There is a time for
detail and there is a time for generality. The reader of my papers will know that
I and my coworkers do not stint on detail, whether it is in explication or in
perusal of the literature. But the time now, here, is for building conceptual
frameworks and so similarity and unity take temporary precedence over differ-
ence and diversity.
   Recall that the reason for building up the frontier orbitals of inorganic
fragments is that we wish to use these orbitals in the construction of organome-
tallic and inorganic complexes. We are now ready for that task. For instance, if
we want trimethylenemethane iron tricarbonyl we construct a molecular orbit-
al interaction diagram, 27. On one side are the newly learned orbitals of
F e ( C O ) 3, on the other side the older, better known frontier orbitals of
C(CH 2)3. We interact the two, using the full armament of group theory and
perturbation theory (7) to follow what happens.
   I will not trace this argument any further, for the primary purpose of this
lecture is not the description of the electronic structure of organometallic
complexes. My coworkers and I have done this comprehensively elsewhere. (1,
8) Instead, I wish to describe a bridge between organic and inorganic chemis-
try that becomes possible the moment we gain knowledge of the orbitals of the
ML n fragments.

 THE ISOLOBAL ANALOGY

 Consider the d7 fragment, Mn(CO) 5 (or CO(CN) 53-). Above three lone pairs
 in the t2g set this doublet molecule has a single electron in a hybrid pointing
 away from the ML5. The similarity to CH3, the methyl radical, is obvious, 28.


                                               R. Hoffmann                                              41


The drawing 28 is, of course, schematic. In Figure 1 I show the a 1 orbitals of
M n H 55- and CH3, so as to provide a more realistic comparison.

   If d7 M L5 is like CH3 then they should both behave similarly. Let us think
about what a methyl radical does. It dimerizes to ethane and starts radical
c h a i n s . M n ( C O )5 o r C O ( C N )5 3- d o s i m i l a r t h i n g s . T h e y d i m e r i z e t o
                                        , and there is a rich radical-type chemistry of
                                     , 29
each. (9) One can even codimerize the organic and inorganic fragments to give
(CO) 5MnCH 3. That may not be the preferred way to make this quite normal
organometallic alkyl complex in the laboratory, but the construction on paper
is quite permissible.

    C H3 a n d d7 M L5 resemble each other. Another way we can see that
 resemblance, traceable to their singly occupied al orbitals, is to compare the
 overlap of both orbitals with a probe ligand, let us say a hydrogen. This is done
 in Figure 2. Note the remarkable parallelism of the two overlaps. The H-CH3
 overlap is everywhere smaller than the H-MnL5 overlap, but the dependence
 of both on the distance is quite similar.


42                                       Chemistry 1981




   A word is needed to describe the resemblance of the two fragments, CH3 and
d M L5. They are certainly not isostructural, nor are they isoelectronic.
  7



However, both possess a frontier orbital which looks approximately the same
for the two fragments. We will call two fragments isolobal if the number,
symmetry properties, approximate energy and shape of the frontier orbitals
and the number of electrons in them are similar-not identical, but similar.10
Thus CH 3 is isolobal with Mn(CO) 5. We will introduce a symbol for the
isolobal relationsship: a “two-headed” arrow with half an orbital below. Thus,



Let’s extend the definition a little.
   (1) If Mn(CO)5 is isolobal with CH3, so are Tc(CO)5 and Re(CO) 5, as well
a s F e ( C O )5 + . The shape of the al hybrid will vary slightly with different
principal quantum number, but essentially it is only the d-electron count that
matters.

    (2) If Mn(CO) 5 is isolobal with CH 3, then Cr(CO) 5, Mo(CO) 5 or W(CO) 5
are isolobal with CH 3+, and Fe(CO) 5 (square pyramidal!) is isolobal with
C H 3 -.
    (3) If Mn(CO) 5 is isolobal with CH 3, so are Mn(PR 3) 5 or MnCl 55- or any
d M L5 species. And so is CpFe(CO) 2, a ubiquitous fragment. The procedure
  7



here is to write CpFe(CO) 2 a s C p-F e+ ( C O )2 and to replace the Cp - by its
isolobal equivalent of three carbonyls, reaching Fe(CO)5+ , isoelectronic with
M n ( C O ) 5.
    Let us go on the ML4 fragment. It is clear that a d 8 M L4, e.g. Fe(CO)4, is
isolobal with a methylene or carbene, CH2.




As 30 reveals, both fragments have two electrons in delocalized a 1 and




b 2 orbitals which are the equivalent of two localized hybrids. There are
explicable differences in the ordering of the two combinations. (11) The differ-
ent ordering has, however, no grave consequences - recall that we are not so
much interested in the fragments themselves as in their bonding capabilities.
The moment we interact Fe(CO) 4 or CH 2 with another ligand, the initial
ordering of al and b2 becomes relatively unimportant since both are typically
strongly involved in the bonding.
    Dimerize, conceptually, the isolobal fragments Fe(CO)4 and CH2. One gets
the known ethylene, 31, the carbene-iron tetracarbonyl complex, 32, deriva-
tives of which are known, (12) and Fe 2( C O )8, 33. The last is an unstable
molecule, so far observed only in a matrix. (13) We come here to a cautionary
note on the isolobal analogy. The isolobal analogy carries one between organic
and inorganic molecules of similar electronic structure. But there is no guaran-
tee that the result of such an isolobal mapping                   leads one to a
molecule of great kinetic stablity. It might, and it might not.


44                                 Chemistry 1981


   Lest the reader be concerned about this limitation of the analogy let me
remind him or her of what happens as one proceeds from ethylene down Group
IV. Si, Ge, Sn, Pb substitution leads to olefin analogues, but they are kinetical-
ly and thermodynamically so unstable that it has taken great effort to provide
evidence for their fleeting existence.
   F e2(CO) 8, 33, has π and π∗ levels similar to those of ethylene. But the low
energy of its π ∗ makes this molecule coordinatively unsaturated. It can, for
instance, add another CO to reach the stable diiron enneacarbonyl. More
interesting, as we will soon see, it is the strategy of stabilizing the unstable
F e2( C O )8 by making a complex of it, just as is routinely done for unstable
organic molecules l-3.
   F e ( C O ) 4 , R u ( C O )4 , or Os(CO) 4 may be trimerized in various combina-
tions with methylene, in 34-37. These cyclopropanes, ranging from all organic
to all inorganic, are known. But note that when I show the “all-metallic” three-




membered ring I have to go to O S . It is well known that the ground state
structure of Fe 3( C O )12 is 38, with two bridging carbonyls. (14) Another
limitation of the isolobal analogy is exposed here: the unbridged Fe structure
analogous to 37 is certainly not much higher in energy than 38, but neverthe-
less the lowest energy structure is bridged. Movement of some ligands (e.g.
carbonyls, but not phosphines) in and out of bridging sites is an experimental
reality, a facile process, for transition metal complexes, especially of the first
transition series. Such easy terminal to bridging interconversions are rare in
organic chemistry, with the exception of carbonium ions. Bridging in inorganic
structures, when it does occur, does not cause a major perturbation in the
nature of the frontier orbitals.

   Consider next the d9 M L3 fragment, e.g. Co(CO) 3. This is isolobal with a
carbyne CH, as 39 shows. Once again there are differences, though of no great
significance, in the a1 versus e energy ordering between the two fragments.
Their similarity is revealed most strikingly by the existence of the entire series
of mixed organic and inorganic tetrahedranes, 40-44. To be sure, 41 can be
called a cyclopropenium complex and 42 a binuclear acetylene complex, but I
do believe that something is gained in seeing the entire series as a progression of
isolobal substitution.




   The fundamentals of the isolobal analogy have now been exposed. Just how
far reaching the relationships written down here


46                                Chemistry 1981


are will become clearer in a while. For the moment it is important to note that
the isolobal analogy is not solely the creation of my research group. In his
fruitful explorations of the reactivity of d8 square planar complexes J. Halpern
often made use of the similarity of such an ML4 entity to a carbene. (9a) He
did the same for d 7 ML 5 and organic free radicals. (9b) L. F. Dahl, in a
beautiful series of structural studies of transition metal clusters, saw clearly
the relationship of the orbitals of an MLn fragment to a chalcogen or pnicogen
atom, which of course are easily related to CR. (15,16) And most importantly,
K. Wade (17) and D. M. P. Mingos (18) independently developed a compre-
hensive and elegant picture of the electronic structure of transition metal
clusters by relating them to the polyhedral boron hydrides (which W. N.
Lipscomb and I studied - the circle closes!) It is a trivial step from BH to CH+.
All of these workers saw the essence of the isolobal analogy.


STRUCTURAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE ISOLOBAL ANALOGY

How quickly do the hands and mind of man provide us with the problem of
choice! The molecules I would need to illustrate the isolobal analogy at work
did not exist thirty years ago. Now they are around us, in superabundance. I
have made a selection, based in part on the ease with which these lovely
molecules illustrate the principles, in part on the ambiguous and ephemeral
basis of recent ( 1981) appearance in the literature.
  One obvious use of the isolobal analogy is in the structural sense. The
analogy allows us to see the simple essence of seemingly complex structures. I
should like to show you some examples centering on the ML 4 fragment.
  Last summer there appeared a structure of the cluster HRe 3 ( C O ) 1 2
Sn(CH 3)2 from the work of H. D. Kaesz and collaborators. (19) The unique
hydrogen was not located; presumably it bridges one Re-Re bond. If we remove
the hydrogen as a proton, a convention we have found useful, 8n we reach Re3
(CO) 12 SnMe 2-.45. Not a usual molecule, but the isolobal chain




allows us immediately to see the very close similarity of this structure to the
previously known 46 (20) and 47 (21) .

by complexation. A pretty example is at hand, 49. (22) Two Fe 2(CO) 8 units
are complexed by a tin atom! Note the pinning back of the equatorial carbon-
yls, analogous to the bending back of hydrogens in a transition metal com-
plexed olelin. Alternatively, and interestingly, this is spiropentane.




    Earlier in 1981, J. Lewis, B. F. G. Johnson and their collaborators published
 a synthesis and structure of Os5( C O )19. (23) The structure appears terribly
 complicated, 50, until one realizes it is really 51, a typical trigonal bipyramidal
 Os(CO) 5 derivative, with two of the equatorial carbonyls substituted by ole-
 fins, or rather by the Os2(CO) 8 olelin analoques. The “olefin” orientation is
just as it should be. (1k, o)

  Another system isolobal to ethylene and Fe 2 ( C O )8 is the “mixed dimer"
(CO) 4FeCH 2. Upon formally shifting an electron from the metal to the car-
bon, a bit of alchemy, one gets to a phosphido complex, 52:




   The reason for this transformation sequence is that complexes of Mn(CO)4
PR 2 have been made. P. Braunstein, D. Grandjean and coworkers have report-
ed a remarkable set of structures, among them the three shown with their
isolobal analogues in 53-55. (24) I n each structure we can see the obvious
ethylene-like (CO)4 MnPR2 entity.




   At the same time that these structures were published there appeared a
structure of 56, synthesized in an entirely different way by R. J. Haines, N. D.
C. T. Steen and R. B. English. (25) Unbridge the two semibridged carbonyls,
do a bit more of electronic alchemy relating Mn-Pt to Fe-Rh, and the relation-
ship to 55 becomes crystal clear.

  Realizing that                                        we see immediately
that 57 is still another Fe 2( C O ) 8 analogue.




  Thus, the W. A. Herrmann methylene complex, 58, is a two-thirds inorganic
cyclopropane. (26)

but first we need to examine one extension of the isolobal concept.


THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ML n , and ML n-2 F R A G M E N T S

Earlier in the discussion we looked at two octahedral fragments, ML5 a n d
ML 4, in which a pair of axial ligands remained. If we remove these ligands, 59,
an interesting extension of the isolobal analogy emerges.

If the z axis is oriented along the direction of the vanishing ligands, then it is
clear that the main result of this perturbation is that the metal d z2 is lowered in
energy. It returns from the metal-ligand       antibonding manifold to become a
non-bonding orbital, 60, 61. (1o, 3c)




The high-lying orbitals (one in ML 5, two in ML4) remain. (27) The obvious
relationships that emerge then are those between a d n M L5 and a dn+2
C 2v o r T - s h a p e d M L 3 ; and between d n C 2 vM L4 a n d dn+2 M L2 . Or to put it
explicitly in terms of the most common fragments, 62.

   An obvious application is to olefin complexes; the similarity of (CO) 4F e
( C2H 4) and (PR 3) 2 N i ( C2H 4), and that of (CO) 5 Cr(C 2H 4) and Zeise’s salt
emerges directly. (1o, x )
   Returning to the [CpRh(CO)] 2 analogue of ethylene, we can now think
about some other structures. First, it turns out that moving the carbonyls into
the bridge does little to change the ethylene-like nature of the dirhodium

  Essentially the same fragment, 63, reappears in the fantastic [Cp’Rh (CO)] 4
Pt structure of F. G. A. Stone and coworkers, 65, (29)                   and
can be related to the              structure earlier synthesized by the same
group, 66. (30)

It turns out that not only is d9 C o ( C O )3 isolobal with CH, but so is d 5
CpW(CO) 2. To see how this comes about let us first relate the Cp complex to a
simple MLn.




    As was shown earlier, Cr(CO) 5+ is isolobal with CH32+ . That is not a very
productive analogy. So let us examine Cr(CO)5 + in more detail. The electronic
structure of an ML5 fragment was given earlier. It is repeated in more detail at
left in 67. The ML 5-CH 3 analogy concentrates on the hybrid of               (a1)
symmetry. But the t2g set, even if it is less “directional” than the hybrids, has
extent in space and well-defined symmetry properties. In particular, two of the
t2g orbitals are of π pseudosymmetry, one of δ . If, as we are forced to do by the
electron deficiency, we extend our view at least to the π component of the t2g set
(dotted lines at right in 67), we see a clear relationship between d5 M L5 a n d
CH, just as there is between d7 M L5 and CH 3.

A little further reflection will show that by using one half of the π set of the t2g
we can get a relationship between d6 M L5 and CH2.

  To summarize:




or to put it another way




This gives us another way of looking at things, a deprototonation analogy. In what
way is CH3+ like CH2 or like CH-? Let us draw out their orbitals schematical-
ly, including CH4 for good measure, in 68.




 Taking away a proton from each molecular fragment does not change its ability
 to function as a donor (though its quality or donor strength will be very
 different). Each fragment, from CH 4 to C4-, is in principle an eight electron
 donor.
   To recapitulate: the isolobal analogy is not a one-to-one mapping. A d 6 M L5
 fragment is isolobal with CH 3+ a n d C H2 a n d C H . This is why the d
                                                         -                     5

   The isolobal analogy for low d-electron count metals has been exploited most
notably in the work of F.G.A. Stone’s group at Bristol. Just four compounds
from their many beautiful examples are shown in 69-72. (31)




   S i n c e                                           69 is cyclopropane. Since
CpW(CO) 2 is isolobal with CR, 70 is cyclopropene. Both isomers 71 and 72 are
related to (CO)3Fe(cyclobutadiene), 1, or for that matter to the organic square
pyramidal C 5H 5+ . (32)


FROM INORGANIC TO ORGANIC CHEMISTRY

The psychological direction of the isolobal analogy in general has been to make
one feel more comfortable about the structures of complex inorganic molecules
by relating them to known, presumably simpler, organic molecules. It is
interesting to reverse this process and think about as yet unsynthesized organic
structures related to known inorganic ones. The mapping from one realm of
chemistry to the other must be accompanied by the warning already given:
there is no guarantee that the “product” of an isolobal transformation is as
stable, kinetically or thermodynamically, as the “reactant”. (33)
   Fe(CO) 3 is isolobal with CH+ . Thus, 1 is related to C 5H 5+ , 73, (32) and the
ubiquitous ferroles, 74, (34) are related to C6R 62+ , 75. 35) Another product of

the interaction of acetylenes with iron carbonyls is the flyoverbridge, 76, a
binuclear ring-opened fulvene complex. (34) The isolobal replacement carries
over to 77. This is an unusual C 8H8 2+ of C2 symmetry, a hypothetical doubly
homoallylic cation. It is not a geometry one would normally have thought of for




a heptafulvene dication, yet once reached by the isolobal mapping it appears to
be geometrically reasonable. (36) M ore such mappings await exploitation.


FROM ORGANIC REACTION MECHANISMS TO INORGANIC ONES

R. J. Puddephatt, C. F. H. Tipper and co-workers have discovered a remark-
able rearrangement of a platinacyclobutane, 78, in which a carbon adjacent to




the metal, with its substituents, exchanges in a very specific way with the
carbon opposite the metal. (37) Thelabelling ex periment of C. P. Casey that
shows this most directly is given in 79. (38) How does this happen?


56                               Chemistry 1981




  Kinetic evidence for a primary dissociative step to C1 2(py)Pt(CH 2)3 exists.
(37) Suppose the ML3 fragment can distort from its original T shape to a C 3V
geometry. Since d8PtCl 2(py) is isolobal with CH+ we can see a relationship to
the cyclobutyl cation, 80.




   This association immediately brings to mind the entire complex of specula-
tions and facts surrounding the facile rearrangement of cyclobutyl cations
through bicyclobutonium waypoints. (39) The motions likely to occur are
shown in 81. Ligand loss is followed by geometric reorganization at the metal,
approach to a “bicyclobutonium structure”, an itinerary around the periphery
of a Jahn-Teller wheel through “cyclopropyl carbinyl” waypoints and exit
through an isomeric “bicyclobutonium” structure. This is but one instance
among many where the isolobal analogy is useful in moving between organic
and inorganic reaction mechanisms.

BEYOND THE OCTAHEDRON

The octahedron was a most useful starting point for generating fragment
frontier orbitals, thereby engendering the isolobal analogy. But the octahedral
polytype is not unique for six-coordinate complexes, and higher coordination
numbers are feasible. We seek another more far-ranging derivation and find
one based on the eighteen electron rule.
   An (unoriginal) justification of this rule goes as follows: Consider n ligands, n
     coming up to a metal with its 9 valence orbitals, 82. A little group theory
shows that for the octahedron and most, but not quite all, coordination geome-
tries the n ligand orbitals will find a match in number, symmetry properties
and extent in space among the hybrid sets that can be formed from the nine
metal orbitals. The exceptions are very well understood. (40) Given this match,
n M-L bonding combinations will go down in energy, n M-L              * antibonding




combinations will go up, and 9-n metal orbitals will remain relatively un-
touched, approximately non-bonding. The eighteen electron rule then is the
statement: “Thou shalt not fill antibonding orbitals”. Filling bonding (n) +
nonbonding (9-n) orbitals leads to 9 electron pairs or eighteen electrons.
   This “proof’ is trivial but not silly. Upon a little reflection it will lay bare the
limitations of the eighteen electron rule on the left and right side of the
transition series, for special symmetry cases, and for weak-field ligands.
   Next remove a ligand, a base, from the 18 electron complex. A localized hole
on the metal, a directional hybrid, is created. The electron pair leaves with the
ligand, 83. To put it in another way, in some localized description of the


58                                Chemistry 1981




bonding, one M-L         bond was formed by interaction of a ligand pair of
electrons with a metal based hybrid. Reversing the process, breaking the bond,
frees that hybrid.
   A parallel analysis for main group elements leads to the octet rule, since only
s and p are considered as valence orbitals. Hybrids are freed by removing
ligands, so that CH3+ has one vacant directional orbital, CH22+ has two such.
   The parallel between MLn, and EL, fragments (M = transition metal, E =
main group element) derives from the generation of similar hybrid patterns on
removal of ligands from 18 or 8 electron configurations. For instance, if the
octahedral polytope is used as a starting point, the eighteen electron rule is
satisfied for a d 6 M L6 T h e d6 M L5 will have one hybrid and no electrons in
the gap between antibonding and bonding or nonbonding levels, just like
C H3 + , 84. d M L4 will have two empty hybrids, so will CH2 . The common
              6                                                 2+



form of the isolobal analogy follows.

  The advantage of this alternative derivation is that it is easily extended to
higher coordination numbers. For instance in any of the multitude of seven
coordinate geometries (8g) the 18 electron configuration is d4. It follows
immediately that for fragments derived from these seven-coordinate structures




From an eightcoordinate starting point, (8p) where the 18 electron
configuration is d2:




The conclusions may be summarized in Table 1. Note once again the non-
isomorphic, many-to-one nature of the isolobal analogy. Also, the results of the
previous section on “Into the t2g Shell” are contained in the present discussion.

MISCELLANEA

The general rules in hand, the cautions understood, one can proceed to apply
the isolobal analogy. Indeed my strategy has been to show the applications as I
introduced extensions of the model. Here are some additional examples:
   In a recent study of binuclear acetylene complexes the discussion focused on
four structural types, 85-88. (41)




   That these were isolobal with tetrahedrane, an olefin, bicyclobutane and
cyclobutene was not only a curiosity, but actually made easier for us the
complicated analysis of the interconversions of these molecules. And the isolo-
bal analogy points to the synthesis of the as yet unknown “isomers” in the
series, dimetallacyclobutadienes and butadienes, already known in complexed
form.
   Finally for amusement, consider the chain assembled by H. Vahrenkamp
and coworkers, 89. (42) (No implication is made in the simplified drawing of
the chain stereochemistry.) There had better a relationship to n-heptane, and
so there is. We proceed using Table 1 as needed. CpCr(CO) 3 appears in a
seven-coordinate guise here, so does CpCr(CO) 2; while Co(CO) 3 a n d
Fe(CO) 4 are in a live-coordinate environment. It follows that:

Now it is simple-the inorganic chain 89 is really n-heptane.




ONE OF MANY BRIDGES
The isolobal analogy is a model. It is the duty of our scientific craft to push it to
its extremes, and being only a model it is certain to fail somewhere. For any
model, as ingenious a construction as it might be, is bound to abstract only a
piece of reality. The reader has seen just how far the model can be pushed and
he or she has seen where it breaks down.
   The pleasing aspect of this particular model is that it brings together differ-
ent subfields of our central science. We are separated, split asunder - organic,
inorganic, physical, biological, analytical chemists - by the very largesse of our
creation. The variety of molecules we create, and the methods we use to study
them breed jargon and specialization. Yet underneath the seeming complexity
there must be a deep unity. I think this approach would have pleased R. B. W.



ACKNOWLEDGMENT
It should be obvious to the reader that the spirit of this new line of work of my
group owes much to what went on before. In particular I owe a direct debt of
gratitude to my teachers M. P. Gouterman, W. N. Lipscomb, Jr., E. J. Corey,
R. B. Woodward and my younger collaborators in the “organic days”. E. L.

Muetterties helped me learn inorganic chemistry. But it is my coworkers -
graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, senior visitors - who in long group

    I am in the business of communicating ideas to people. The graphical aspect
 of this enterprise, be it lecture slides or published articles, is critical. Through-
 out these years nearly all of my drawings, containing countless “lined orbitals”,
 have been expertly and beautifully executed by Jane S. Jorgensen and Elisa-
 beth Fields, to whom I’m most grateful. The typing of my manuscripts and the
 associated details of production are the outcome of hard work by Eleanor R.
 Stolz and Eda J. Kronman, and I thank them for their help.
    Throughout this period my research has been generously supported almost
 entirely by a research grant from the National Science Foundations’ Quantum
 Chemistry Program. Other support has come from the Materials Science
 Center at Cornell, and smaller unrestricted research grants from Eli Lilly,
 Allied and Exxon Foundation.

(10) The term “isolobal” was introduced in Reference 1e, but the concept, as we will see below, is
     older.
(11) In methylene a, is below bs because the latter is a pure p orbital, while the former has some s
     character. In Fe(CO) 4 the a 1, and b 2 can be thought of as being derived from the        orbital
                   of the octahedron. Removal of two cis ligands stabilizes x 2- y2 ( b2) more than it
     does z 2 (a,). Were the ligands removed trans, to reach the square planar ML 4 fragment, the
     situation would be reversed. See also Reference 3.
