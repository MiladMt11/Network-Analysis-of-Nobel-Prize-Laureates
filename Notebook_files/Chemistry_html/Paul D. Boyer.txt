OVERVIEW
I have a deep appreciation for the unusual and unexpected chain of events that has brought me the 
Nobel Award. It is my good fortune to be a spokes- man for a considerable number of outstanding 
researchers in the field of bio- energetics whose efforts have revealed an unusual and novel 
mechanism for one of nature's most important enzymes. Over 50 years ago a vital cellular process 
called oxidative phosphorylation was demonstrated. The process was recognized as the major way that 
our bodies capture energy from foods to be used for a myriad  of essential  cellular  functions,  
but how it occurred  was largely unknown. The intervening  years have seen much progress. Today I 
will tell you how contributions of my research group in the 1970s led to new hypotheses  that  
helped  overcome  the  limitations  of old paradigms,  which were no longer applicable. We gained 
further support of the hypotheses and clarified other aspects of the process in the 1980s and early 
1990s. Then as John Walker,  my co-recipient  will relate, the X-ray structural  data from his 
group became available. The structural information, about the catalytic por- tion of the enzyme for 
the phosphorylation, supported the most novel and least accepted aspect of our hypotheses. Now on 
this occasion, John and I can tell you how a truly remarkable  molecular  machine accomplishes  the 
oxid- ative phosphorylation that was left unexplained for over half a century.
A key player in the process is called ATP, the abbreviation  for adenosine
triphosphate. At the time I was a graduate student, Fritz Lipmann ( 1) recog- nized the broad role 
ATP played in biological energy capture and use. The adenosine portion for our purposes can be 
regarded as a convenient handle to bind the ATP to enzymes. It is the three phosphate groups 
attached in a row, particularly  the last two, that participate  in energy capture. When the energy 
stored in ATP is used, the terminal anhydride bond is split, forming adenosine diphosphate (ADP) 
and inorganic phosphate (Pi). The resynthesis
of  ATP,  coupled  to  energy  input,  is  catalyzed  by  an  enzyme  called  ATP
synthase, present in abundance  in intracellular membranes of animal mito- chondria, plant 
chloroplasts, bacteria and other organisms. The ATP made by your ATP synthase is transported out of 
the mitochondria and used for the function of muscle, brain, nerve, kidney, liver and other 
tissues, and for trans- port and for making a host of compounds that the cell needs. The ADP and

phosphate formed when ATP is used return to the mitochondria and ATP is made again using the energy 
from the oxidations. I estimate  that the net syn- thesis  of  ATP  is  the   most  prevalent  
chemical  reaction  that  occurs  in  your body. Indeed, because plants and  microorganisms capture 
and use energy by the same reaction, and the amount of biomass is large, the formation and use of 
ATP is the  principal  net chemical  reaction  occurring in  the whole world. This is obviously a 
very important  reaction. How does it occur?
All  living  cells  contain  hundreds  of  large,  specialized  protein  molecules called  enzymes. 
 These  catalyze  the  hundreds of  chemical  reactions  that are necessary  for  the  cell  to 
function. Among  these  are  the  reactions  by which energy is captured  by the  mitochondria, 
which are  packed into muscle, brain and other cells. Inside the mitochondria  and  imbeded  in its 
membranes are enzymes  that catalyze oxidation  of  the  food you eat. They essentially  burn  it, 
using  oxygen  and  producing  carbon  dioxide  and  water,  in  a series  of  small steps, each 
catalysed  by a special enzyme. The  oxygen you are breathing now is  carried  by  the   hemoglobin 
 of  your  red  blood  cells,  then  it  reaches  the mitochondria  where  it oxidizes iron  atoms  
that are  part of  a specialized  en- zyme, which in turn oxidizes other enzymes in a respiratory 
chain. The blood stream carries the carbon dioxide produced to the lungs for exhaling. The se- 
quence  of oxidations liberates  protons  and  promotes a charge  that  tends  to force protons 
across  the  membrane. Similarly,  in  chloroplasts  light energy is coupled  to the formation of 
protonmotive force. This protonmotive force, as shown  by  the  1978  Nobelist  Peter  Mitchell  
(2) ,  causes  protons  (hydrogen ions)  to  be  translocated  through  the ATP  synthase  
accompanied  by forma- tion  of ATP. The   important  and very difficult question  that  remained  
unan- swered for many years was how the ATP synthase  uses the protonmotive force to make ATP.

ATP SYNTHASE
First I will summarize what is now known about the ATP synthase, then con- vey aspects  of how  
this knowledge  was attained.  The enzyme  uses a novel mechanism that has catalytic steps 
different from any that had been seen be- fore with other enzymes. A sketch that depicts the enzyme 
function is avail- able on the Nobel Foundation internet site. A similar sketch was provided in a 
recent paper from Richard Cross's laboratory  (3) . The ATP synthase has three copies each of large 
n and b subunits, with three catalytic sites located mostly on the § subunit at the interface of 
the n and § subunits. A y subunit core and smaller 6 and e subunits complete a portion known as F„  
with a sub- unit composition in order of decreasing size designated as O₃§₃y6e.This por- tion of 
the enzyme was first isolated in the laboratory of a splendid investiga- tor,  Efraim  Racker,  and 
 shown  to  act  as  an  ATPase  (4).  Several  leading investigators  in  the  bioenergetic  field 
were  trained  in Racker's  laboratory.

' Abbreviations  used for  the  F -ATPase from various sources are: From  heart mitochondria  MF„ 
from chloroplasts CFI, from E. coli EcF,, from  Kagawa's thermophilic  bacterium TF,.

122                Chemistry 199'7

The   F,-ATPase' catalyzes ATP hydrolysis but not ATP synthesis. The  rest of the enzyme, imbedded 
in the membrane, is known as F0; in E. colt the   F0 contains a large subunit a, two copies of a 
subunit b and   probably 12 copies of a much smaller  c subunit.  The  Ft of  the  mitochondrial  
enzyme  is much  more  com- plex. The  designation  FIFO-ATPase  is sometimes used in the 
literature for the complete ATP synthase.
During net ATP synthesis  the  three catalytic sites on  the enzyme, acting in sequence,  first  
bind  ADP  and   phosphate,  then  undergo  a  conformational change  so as  to  make  a  tightly  
bound  ATP,  and   then  change  conformation again  to release  this ATP. These changes are 
accomplished  by a striking rota- tional catalysis driven by a rotating inner core of the  enzyme, 
which in turn is driven by the  protons crossing the mitochondrial  membrane. I share the view that 
 revealing  the  mechanism  of  the  ATP synthase  is a fine achievement  of modern  biochemistry.  
I  am  also  keenly  aware  that  this achievement  comes from the sum of the  research of many 
members of the bioenergetics commu- nity,  who  deserve  a  major  share  in  the  recognition  of  
the  accomplishment. But  the  Nobel  awards  tend  to make  heroes of only one  or  a few of  
those  re- sponsible.  It  is  my  good  fortune  to  be  addressing  you  today  because  my 
research  group, strongly dependent on  the information  provided  by others, gained  the first 
insights into three unusual features of the  ATP synthase cata- lysis. These unusual features are 
energy-linked  binding changes that include release  of  a  tightly  bound  ATP, sequential  
conformational changes  of  three catalytic sites to accomplish  these binding changes, and  a 
rotary mechanism that drives the  conformational changes. These features had  not been  recog- 
nized  previously in enzymology.

EARLY PROBES
In the mid-1950s, some 12 years after receiving my Ph.D., some experiments on  how ATP is made were 
conducted  in  my laboratory.  One  concerned  the capture of energy in glycolysis. We found that 
the oxidation of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate  could  occur  without  the  participation  of  
inorganic  phosphate
(5) , suggesting  participation  of  an  acyl  enzyme  intermediate.  Extension  of these 
experiments, and salient findings in Racker's group  (6) , demonstrated that a sulfhydryl group on  
the enzyme was acylated  and  the acyl enzyme was cleaved  by  inorganic  phosphate  to  form  
1,3-diphosphoglycerate,  which  in turn  transferred  a phosphoryl  group  to ADP  to make ATP. The 
  demonstra- tion that two covalent intermediates, the acyl enzyme and  the phosphorylated 
substrate, preceded ATP formation  made it seem logical to seek for similar in- termediates  in  
oxidative  phosphorylation.  As  we  and  others  learned  years later, this was not  a useful 
approach.
Of  more  relevance  to  ATP  synthase  were  experiments  with  '⁸O  and  ³°P, initiated  because 
of  the demonstration  by Mildred  Cohn  that mitochondria would  catalyze  a  rapid  exchange  of  
phosphate  oxygens  with  those  of  water
(7) . We found from  the "²P experiments that the overall reaction of oxidative phosphorylation   
was   dynamically   reversible    (8) .   The            experiments

Paul  D.  Buyer                                                     123
revealed  the  striking  finding  that  the  exchange  of  inorganic  phosphate oxygens with water 
was occurring even more rapidly. As illustrated in Fig. 1, we attributed this to the formation of a 
covalent intermediate, which was then cleaved by inorganic phosphate. We tried unsuccessfully to 
separate out frac- tions from mitochondria  that would catalyze the first step leading to the for- 
mation of an intermediate in oxidative phosphorylation. It was some sixteen years later  that we 
found  the simple explanation  that no intermediate  was formed, and that the rapid "O   exchange  
resulted  from the rapid and re- versible formation of a tightly bound ATP.

Adapted from (7). In this early study covalent intermediates were proposed to explain an oxygen 
exchange more rapid than the overall reaction reversal.


In the 1960s we embarked on another, only partially successful, series of ex- periments. By using 
32P as a sensitive tracer, we found in mitochondria a 32P- labeled protein that was an intermediate 
between inorganic phosphate and ATP.  We  identified   this  as  a  previously   unrecognized  
phosphorylated protein, with a phosphoryl  group attached  to a histidine  residue. We mis- takenly 
thought we had identified an intermediate in oxidative phosphoryla- tion, but subsequently found it 
to be an intermediate in GTP or ATP forma- tion by the  succincyl  CoA synthetase  of the  citric  
acid  cycle  (9) . We were
reaching for a gold but got a bronze instead.

'8O EXCHANGES AND A NEW CONCEPT
For several years we mostly studied other problems, including taking a look at active transport in 
ñ. coli.  This study gave evidence for an intermediate and unidentified energized state (10) , but 
we did not characterize this state or pay enough attention to the rumblings coming from Peter 
Mitchell's laboratory. It was difficult for me to accept protonmotive force as a driving agent for 
ATP formation when I could not visualize a logical way this could occur. But the lure of the ATP 
synthase  continued, and we tried to get leads with photo- phosphorylation by spinach thylakoid 
membranes as well as oxidative phos-

phorylation  by  heart  mitochondria.  The  use of  the  '⁸0   exchange  measure- ments to study 
the  process provided a crucial insight. The  types of exchange that can  be measured  are readily 
understood  with  the  aid  of  the diagram  in Fig. 2. The  box in  Fig. 2 represents a catalytic 
site. ADP and  Pi  can  bind and
be converted  to a tightly  bound ATP. The  water formed  freely interchanges
with  medium  water.  Reversal  of  this reaction  results in  the incorporation  of one water 
oxygen into the bound P,. If the P  can tumble freely at  the  cataly- tic site, when bound ATP is 
again formed there are three chances out of four that it will contain a water oxygen. Various 
exchanges of phosphate  oxygens with  water  oxygens  are  measurable,  as  shown  in  Table  1.  
The  oxygen  ex- changes  thus provide sensitive  probes of reaction  steps that otherwise  might 
be hidden.
The ¹‘O  probes  revealed  a puzzling  aspect,  namely  that  the intermediate

Pi          HOH  was unusually insensitive  to uncouplers of oxidative phosphoryla- tion. As shown 
in Fig. 3, even  though  the potent uncoupler called S-13 allow- ed  oxidation  to  proceed  
without  net  ATP  synthesis,  the  rapid  exchange  of phosphate  and  water  oxygens  continued.  
The  significance  of  this  was  not grasped for some time. But one  day, while listening to a 
seminar that I did not understand,  the oxygen exchange data churned in my mind. It became clear to 
 me  that  the results could  be explained  if  the energy from  oxidations was not   used  to  
make the ATP  molecule,  but  instead  was  used  to  bring  about  a release of a tightly bound 
ATP. The   reversible  formation  of  the tightly bound ATP  molecule  could  continue  at  the  
catalytic  site without  involving  proton- motive force, and give rise to the 
uncoupler-insensitive oxygen exchange. We
now  had  a  new concept  for oxidative  phosphorylation  and  were anxious  to call  it  to  the  
attention  of  the  field.  The  editors  of  the   journal  of  Biological Chemistry  declined  
the  opportunity  to  publish  this  new concept.  I  used  the privilege of my recent membership  
in the  National Academy of Sciences  (11, Fig.4)  to publish  this first feature of what was to 
become the binding change mechanism  of  ATP  synthesis.  Independently,  Slater's  group,  based  
on  the presence  of  tightly  bound  nucleotides  on  the  isolated  F,-ATPases,  also  sug- 
gested  that energy input might be involved in their release  (12).
Our feeling that the new concept was valid was strengthened  by companion studies  with  the ATPase 
 activity  of  muscle  myosin.  Data  from  my  and  from

Koshland's laboratories (13, 14) had shown that myosin could catalyze both a medium Pi     HOH and 
an intermediate Pi +— HOH exchange. It seemed pos- sible that myosin might be able to spontaneously 
form a tightly bound ATP
from medium ADP and  P.i. Experiments showed this to be the case (15). This
and other  salient properties of myosin  had also been  revealed in contem- porary studies by 
Trentham and associates (lfi, 17). Importantly, the oxygen exchange could be quantitatively 
accounted for by the rate of formation and cleavage of the bound ATP.
Not all bioenergeticists readily accepted the concept that a prime function of energy input was to 
bring about the release of a tightly bound ATP. For example, Mitchell preferred a mechanism in 
which the protons migrated to
the  catalytic  site  and  induced  the  formation  of ATP  from  ADP  and  Pi. It seemed logical 
to me that proton translocation was linked to ATP release in- directly through protein 
conformational changes (18). Without my being in-
formed, my publication was accompanied by a rebuttal from Mitchell (19), and I thus presented a 
more complete model for conformational coupling (20). With time  this indirect manner in which  
proton  translocation  drives ATP formation has become generally accepted, but this does not 
detract from Mitchell's salient recognition of protonmotive force as a means of capturing energy 
for ATP synthesis and active transport.

CATALYTIC COOPERATIVITY
We were  now  launched  on  an  exciting  period  of research.  As we  probed mitochondrial 
oxidative phosphorylation further by ’*P and ’8O isotope ex- changes, some puzzling aspects 
emerged. For example, when submitochond- rial particles capable of oxidative phosphorylation were 
hydrolyzing ATP, a lively medium ATP      HOH exchange occurred. Removal of product ADP stopped 
this exchange  (Fig. 5), although  the reversal of ATP hydrolysis was still occurring on the 
enzyme. Somehow the lack of medium ADP to bind to the enzyme was stopping  the release  of ATP. It 
was not apparent  how  this could occur if the simple scheme of Fig. 2 was used to explain the 
oxygen ex- changes. Similarly, during net synthesis of ATP, removal of the medium ATP stopped  the 
medium  P;      HOH exchange.  An explanation  for why these oxygen exchanges were blocked, and for 
other related observations, was sug- gested by one of my graduate students, Celik Kayalar from 
Turkey. Celik said he could account for these results if the catalytic sites had to work coopera- 
tively, so  that ATP could not be released  from one site unless ADP and P,
were available to bind at another site, or that Pi  could not be released from
one catalytic site unless ATP were available  to bind at another catalytic site. Celik, together 
with Jan Rosing from Holland, demonstrated and characteri- zed sequential and cooperative 
participation of catalytic sites with the synth- ase in submitochondrial particles capable of or 
during oxidative phosphoryla- tion (21, 22). In addition, their results gave evidence that the 
binding changes accompanying proton translocation also promoted the tight binding of P,.
Adolfsen  and  Moudrianakis  suggested  that  site-site  cooperativity  might occur with the 
separated F -ATPase, based on the observation  that a tightly

bound ADP was released when ATP was cleaved by a bacterial F,-ATPase  (23) . Experiments  in  my 
laboratory  revealed  that, as we  had  found  with  the ATP synthase,  a  strong  cooperativity  
of  catalytic  sites  occurs  with  the  isolated ATPase. When  the MF, hydrolyzes relatively high 
concentrations of ATP,  the P, formed contains only slightly more than the one water oxygen 
required for the hydrolysis  (Fig. 6).  But as the ATP concentration is lowered, an instructive 
change occurs. The  hydrolysis velocity is of course lowered,  but  the number of water oxygens 
appearing in each P; formed increases to almost four. It can be calculated  that nearly 400 
reversals of bound ATP hydrolysis occur  before the Pi  formed is released  (10). The  bound ADP 
and  P; formed can not  be re-
leased until ATP is available  to bind at another catalytic site".
Experiments had now made it seem likely that an unexpected  catalytic co- operativity  was  a  
prominent  feature  of  the  ATP  synthase.  At  that  time  the prevailing view was that the 
enzyme had only two catalytic sites, and a diagram depicting  a  bi-site  mechanism  appeared  in  
my  1977  review  article  in  the

we  missed obtaining  this striking result about a decade earlier. At that time Efraim Racker came 
to my laboratory with some FI ATPase so we could find if it catalyzed  an  oxygen  exchange when 
ATP  was  hydrolyzed.  We  conducted  the  reaction  at  a  relatively  high  ATP  concentration,  
and found  the incorporation  of only one  water oxygen, as required for the cleavage reaction. 
Harvey Penefksy  made a similar observation  (24) . If we  had  measured what happened  as  the ATP 
con- centration  was lowered, we would  have revealed  the  catalytic site cooperativity  then. But 
we  had
no reason  to suspect  that  the  enzyme  catalysts for  each substrate  cleaved  would  change  so 
dra- matically  with  substrate  concentration. The strong  catalytic  cooperativity  that  we  
later  demon- strated  had not  been described previously for any other enzyme.

Annual Its     of Biochemists y (25). We recognized, however, that if the enzyme were found  to 
have  three  catalytic  sites, a tri-site  mechanism,  as currently known to occur, would be likely 
(22, 26). The crucial point was that a tightly
bound ATP could not be released until ADP and Pi bound at a second or a second  and third catalytic 
 site and the binding  changes  driven  by proton
translocation  occur. This positive cooperativity  meant that at low substrate concentrations, 
during  either  net synthesis  or hydrolysis  of ATP, a  tightly bound ATP should still be present 
at a catalytic site. We undertook experi- ments to find if this was so. These tests were made with 
submitochondrial par- ticles (27) or chloroplast thylakoids  (28) so that net ATP formation was oc- 
curring  with  ADP  concentrations  far  below  the  apparent  Kg of  ADP  for maximal 
phosphorylation rates. About one tightly bound ATP committed to net ATP formation was found on each 
synthase. Such data give good evidence that strong positive catalytic cooperativity takes place 
under conditions where ATP synthesis is actually occurring. Additional findings from our and from 
other laboratories consistent with or favoring the catalytic cooperativity are summarized elsewhere 
(29).
In 1982, Feldman and Sigman demonstrated  that the CF -ATPase or the ATP synthase on chloroplast 
thylakoids, which have a tightly bound catalytic- site ADP, would  slowly  form  an equilibrium  
concentration  of bound ATP from relatively high concentrations of medium Pi (30, 31). Their 
characteri-
zation of this single site catalysis supported our concept of tight ATP forma-
tion without coupling to protonmotive force. Factors that promote formation of ATP at catalytic 
sites of myosin and F -ATPases likely include the very tight preferential binding of ATP and, as 
suggested by deMeis (32), low water ac- tivity.
Also in 1982, the acceptance of catalytic cooperativity by the field was con- siderably enhanced by 
the determination in Penefsky's laboratory of the rate constants for the interconversion, binding, 
and release steps for MF₁exposed to ATP at molar concentrations less than the molarity of the 
enzyme, condi- tions that gave what was termed uni-site catalysis (33, 34). An additional im- 
portant contribution  from the same laboratory was the demonstration  that the hydrolysis  of a 
trinitrophenyl ATP  bound  at a single  catalytic  site  was markedly increased by the binding of a 
second trinitrophenyl-ATP (35).
A number researchers subsequently found a slow uni-site catalysis with dif- ferent F,-ATPases. 
However, an inability to see a definite uni-site catalysis with TF, raised the question as to 
whether the cooperativity we had observed was a general phenomenon of F,-ATPases (36). That slow 
uni-site catalysis was in- deed occurring was demonstrated by the increase in intermediate P, +— 
exchange  as ATP  concentration  was lowered  (37). For  a number  of years there appeared to be a 
general acceptance that a slow uni-site rate occurs and that the catalytic rate is markedly 
accelerated when ATP binds to additional sites. It was thus somewhat  surprising  when a quite 
recent claim appeared that MF  depleted of bound nucleotides did not show a slow uni-site catalysis 
(38). However, this claim is not experimentally sound; slow uni-site catalysis occurs with either 
native or nucleotide depleted MF, (39, 40) .

RELATED  EXPERIMENTS
My  laboratory  group  at  this  time  also  had  an  experimental  interest  in  the Na*K’-ATPase  
that Prof. Skou has presented. There was uncertainty whether the phosphoryl group that became 
attached  to the enzyme as an intermedia- te in  the  catalysis was on  a glutamyl  or  an  
aspartyl  residue. We  developed  a borohydride  reduction  method  that established  that the 
group was attached to  an  aspartyl  residue  (41,  42) . We  also  discovered  that  the  enzyme  
in  the presence  of  K* and   Mg²’  catalyzed  a  rapid  exchange  of  oxygens  of  Pi  with
water oxygens, attributable  to a dynamic reversal of enzyme phosphorylation
(43). This was and  remains  (44) a useful way to probe this step of the reaction sequence. The 
related Ca”-activated sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase was like- wise found to catalyze a rapid Pi  +— 
 HOH      exchange  (45).
Our  attention was also directed  toward  the capacity of yeast pyrophospha-
tase  to catalyze a P        HOH  exchange  (46). We revealed  that this exchange was due   to a 
reversible  formation  of  an  enzyme-bound  pyrophosphate  (47) and  the details of  the  exchange 
 process were elucidated  (48, 47) . It was im- portant  to us  that  rapid  mixing experiments  
showed  that  the  rate of forma- tion and  cleavage of the  bound pyrophosphate  accounted for the 
oxygen ex- change  (47) . As mentioned  above,  this was shown  previously for  the  bound ATP and 
oxygen exchange catalyzed by myosin. For the  pyrophosphatase ex- change,  Hackney  developed  a 
theoretical  analysis of  the distribution  of '⁸0- labeled species of P, (49)  that was to serve 
us well in studies we had underway
on  oxidative  phosphorylation.  The  Pi   —+ HOH exchange  catalysed  by the
sarcoplasmic reticulum ATPase was also shown  by rapid  mixing and quench- ing experiments  to 
result from  the dynamic  reversal of the  formation  of  the phosphorylated enzyme intermediate  
(50). Such results, and  the demonstra- tion  by Wimmer  and  Rose  that the ATP       HOH  
exchange  catalyzed  by mi- tochondria resulted from the reversible  cleavage of the terminal P-O-P 
bond (5l),  gave   us  confidence   that  in  oxidative   phosphorylation   and   photo- 
phosphorylation  the  oxygen  exchanges  we  observed  were  due   to  the  re- versible  
hydrolysis of tightly bound ATP.



THE NUMBER OF CATALYTIC SITES
Meanwhile  studies  in  other  laboratories  were  revealing  the  subunit  stoichi- ometry of the 
F -ATPase. As noted in a review by Penefsky covering literature up  through  1978  (24), 
considerable  controversy  remained.  The  difficulty of obtaining  satisfactory  molecular  
weights  and  subunit  quantitation  made  it hard  to get a clear choice between the  presence of 
two or  three copies of the major  n  and  §  subunits.  Reports  that  measurements  with  EcF, 
and  TFl  iso-
lated  from  bacteria  grown  on  ['⁴C]-amino acids  (52, 53)  favored  a stoichio-
metry of ti3§3y, seemed convincing  to us. Reports on the composition  of CF, strongly supported 
presence of three each of the large subunits  (54) . On   the basis  of  these  and  other  
developments,  the  field  soon  widely  accepted  the

composition  of Fl-ATPasesas n₃(i3yfie. All of our further experiments have been based on such a 
stoichiometry of subunits.
The number of nucleotide binding sites on the enzyme remained contro- versial until about a decade 
ago. Both O and § subunits were shown to have nucleotide binding sites. Reports in 1982 for MF  
(55) and in 1983 for EcF,
(56) gave good evidence  for the presently accepted values of six potential nucleotide  binding  
sites per enzyme. However,  as late as 1987 claims were still made for only three nucleotide 
binding sites on CFR (57) and four for the liver F, (58). Subsequent data for CFI  (59, 60) and the 
liver enzyme (61), as
well as the highly conserved sequence of the § subunits, support the present
view that all Fl-ATPaseshave six nucleotide binding sites, although differing
considerably in affinity.
Chemical derivatization studies, such as those in Bragg's laboratory  (62) and  summarized  in  
reviews  (63,  29)  showed  that  all  three  §  subunits, although with identical amino acid 
sequence, had distinctly different chemic- al properties. Such heterogeneity was a prominent reason 
why we considered it likely that all three § subunits passed through different conformations dur- 
ing catalysis.  The participation  of all three § subunits in a cooperative, se- quential manner 
was supported, but not proven, by observations (over twen- ty are given in an earlier review (29) ) 
that derivatization of only one site per enzyme would nearly or completely block catalysis. We were 
also impressed by studies in Futai’s  laboratory  showing  that one defective  mutant  § subunit 
stopped catalysis (54), and by related mutational studies in Senior's laborato- ry (65) that 
favored the participation of three equivalent § subunits for cata- lysis.
There has, however, been considerable delay in reaching a general accept- ance that three catalytic 
sites participate in an equivalent manner. A single ca- talytic and two regulatory sites have been 
proposed (66, 67). Various models with only two catalytic sites have been suggested  (68, 69, 70, 
71, 72, 73) , as well as a 1991 model with four functioning catalytic sites arranged in two al- 
ternate pairs (74, 75). A 1989 review by Tiedge and Schafer (76) stresses sym- metrical 
considerations and favors equivalent § subunit participation. Various models, and a 1991 review 
favoring a two-site model (77), were appraised in a review prepared in 1992, in which I attempted 
to consider any experiments not in harmony with the binding change mechanism (29) . The conclusion 
I reached is that very likely  three sites participate  in an equivalent manner. Subsequent  events 
 (see  78)  have  strengthened  this  conclusion,  although some doubts of which I am not aware may 
remain. The probability that three sites participate equivalently has guided experiments in my 
laboratory since the presence of three § subunits first seemed likely.

ROTATIONAL CATALYSIS
Toward the end of the 1970s, we initiated experiments that led to the postu- lation of the third 
feature of the binding change mechanism. The presence of three copies of the major a and § subunits 
and single copies of the y, 6,

132                Chemistry 1997

and  e made it unlikely that all  three  b subunits could  have identical interac- tions  with  
single  copy  subunits.  In  particular,  interactions  with  the  larger  y subunits seemed likely 
to be crucial. McCarty's laboratory had reported that, with  chloroplasts,  light increased  the  
reactivity of -SH groups on  the subunit and  that  modifications  in  the     subunit  increased  
the  leakage  of  protons across  the coupling  membrane  (79, 80). This and  other evidence  
suggested that the y subunit interacted  strongly with  the catalytic § subunit. The  grow- ing 
information  about the synthase gave a base for  the interpretation of ad- ditional experiments 
with ¹  O  that were underway in my laboratory.
Water  highly labeled with "O   had became more available, and  by nuclear magnetic resonance, as 
demonstrated  by Cohn  (81) , or  mass spectrometry we
could measure what we designated as the  "O   isotopomers of Pi , containing 0, 1,  2,  3,  or  4 
180  atoms.  Then  when  ATP  synthesis  or  hydrolysis  occurs  with
highly "O-labeled substrates, under conditions where appreciable oxygen ex- change  occurs,  the 
distribution  of isotopomers formed  can  be  measured.  lf all  the   catalytic  sites  involved  
behave  identically,  the  distributions  of  ’⁸O isotopomers  would  conform  to  a  statistically 
 predicted  pattern.  The  results observed  in a typical experiment for hydrolysis  of ’⁸O-ATP  by 
F  ATPase  are given in Fig. 7 (82). They show that the distribution of isotopomers conforms very 
closely  to  that expected  for  identical  behavior  of  all catalytic  sites. The data rule out 
the possible  participation  of two types of catalytic sites. As shown by one  example in Fig. 7, 
this would give a markedly different distribution of

ty of exchange,  that would  give  the observed  total amount  of oxygen  exchange. Adapted  from

isotopomers. Importantly, experiments with the net ATP synthesis by chloro- plast and mitochondrial 
ATP synthases also showed that all catalytic sites be- have identically (83, 84, 85). The tests 
were sensitive and revealing; if steps of substrate binding, interconverslon or release, or their 
concentration depen- dencies differed among catalytic sites, this should have been revealed in the 
18O experiments.
I was again confronted with unexplained results. Although it might be pos sible to bring a similar 
residue or residues on minor subunits into contact with each of the three b subunits, the 
interactions would not be expected to be identical. The situation might be analogous to the family 
of serine prote- ases, where markedly different sequences can appropriately position a serine 
residue. But the resulting proteases do not conduct their catalyses identically. To me, there 
seemed only one way that all catalytic sites could proceed se- quentially and identically, with 
modulation by one or more single-copy, minor subunits. This was by a rotational catalysis, in which 
large catalytic subunits moved rotationally around a smaller asymmetric core. Such consideration, 
to- gether with what was known about the structure of the enzyme, resulted in the  postulate  of  
rotational  catalysis,  presented  at Gordon  Research  Con- ferences and elsewhere (86, 87, 88). A 
sketch of our view as presented at that time is shown in Fig. 8 (88). The internal core was likened 
to a cam shaft that modulated the conformation of the § subunits. The probability that the core was 
asymmetric  was strengthened when amino acid sequence data became

discussions.

available (89) ; this gave no indications of possible tripartite symmetry of the minor subunits.
Later other suggestions  were made of possible rotational features in the ATP synthase catalysis. 
Increased information  about the structure of the Fq portion of the synthase made some type of 
circular motion in the F₀ attrac- tive. Cox  et  al.  suggested rotational movement of circularly 
arranged  c sub- units (90, 91). Hoppe and Sebald visualized an oligorneric core of c subunits 
rotating against subunit o or b (92), a suggestion  that still seems pertinent. Mitchell proposed a 
rotational model that exposed catalytic sites to a proton channel through the y subunit (93).
The homogeneity of catalysis demonstrated  by the ¹80  technique also, to my mind, ruled out 
postulates, as mentioned earlier, that only two § subunits were involved in catalysis, with the 
other serving a regulatory function. Con- siderations of the need for symmetry in subunit 
interactions made it unlikely that two sites could alternate in catalysis identically. Their 
interactions on one side could not be identical with those on another side at the same stages of 
catalysis.
We attempted some assessments  of subunit positional  interchange  as re- quired by a rotational 
catalysis. The MF -ATPase after labeling one b subunit with radioactive DCCD 
(dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) still retained some activi- ty. A different § subunit reacted with 
2-azido-ATP. After catalytic turnover, the reactivity  toward DCCD and 2-azido-ATP  was randomized, 
 as expected  if a change in relative position and conformation had occurred (94) . In another 
approach, we observed that a mild cross-linking of subunits stopped catalysis, and  that cleavage  
of  the  cross-linker  restored  activity  (95). A report from another  laboratory  that cross 
linking of the  d and  y subunits did not stop catalysis  (96), I  regarded  as inconclusive  (29). 
None of these experiments were as edifying as those that came later from other laboratories (see 
below) . It seemed apparent that an adequate evaluation of the possibility of rotational catalysis 
would need to await the knowledge of the 3-dimensional structure of the F -ATPase. In a review I 
prepared in the spring of 1992, I summarized the case for rotational catalysis at that stage (29). 
This included the need for a
second attachment between F₀ and FI  to act as a stator, and the suggestion that present evidence 
indicated that the fi subunit of the ñ. coli enzyme, or the
analogous OSCP of mitochondria, could help serve this function, a predic- tion that has found 
support in recent experiments (97, 98). Attachment of a stator to the exterior of an n subunit 
might be partly responsible for the asym- metry of the m subunits, an asymmetry that is retained 
during catalysis (99). This may be analogous to the symmetry of the internal rotation of a motor 
not being disrupted by bolting the motor to a bench.
The occurrence of a rotational catalysis was dramatically supported by the X-ray structure for the 
major portion of MFl, attained by Abrahams, Leslie,
Lutter  and Walker  (100). This structure  served  as the  base for innovative
demonstrations of rotation in the laboratories of Cross (2, 101, 102) , Capaldi (103, 104, 105), 
and Kagawa  (97). Sabbert et a1. demonstrated  rotation  by sophisticated fluorescent techniques 
(106, 107) , and Noji et a1. demonstrated

rotation visually (l 08). Such developments allowed me to title a recent review as “The ATP 
Synthase—A Splendid Molecular  Machine”  (78) . These more re- cent aspects of  the  ATP synthase  
story are more appropriately  the subject of my able co-recipientJohn Walker's lecture. But before 
you have the  opportu- nity  to  hear from  him, I want  to discuss some additional  important  and 
 un- settled facets of the ATP synthase catalysis.

SOME ADDITIONAL ASPECTS
Acceptance of the binding change mechanism  over  the past two decades has been fostered  by 
clarification  of a number of unusual aspects of the  synthase action,  some  of  which  are  
mentioned  here. The  number  and  properties  of nucleotide binding sites needed clarification. 
With the use of the 2-azido-ATP, introduced  for studies with  F -ATPases  by Abbot et a1.  (109) , 
we established where  catalytic  and  noncatalytic  sites  resided  with  the  F,-ATPase  from  
dif- ferent sources  (59, 110, 111, 112) . The characteristics of the  Mg²  and  tightly bound  ADP 
 inhibition  of  the  F,-ATPase,  that  had  harassed  our,  and  many other, earlier studies, were 
established  (113, 114). A role for the noncatalytic nucleotides  in  enabling  the inhibition  to 
be overcome  was  uncovered  ( 115, 116) .
A direct  estimation  of  how  many  catalytic  sites were  filled  during  photo- phosphorylation  
was  accomplished   (117) .  The    results  gave  evidence   that near maximal  rates of ATP 
synthesis were attained when a second, and  not a second  and  a  third,  site  were  loaded  with  
substrates.  The  consideration  of these results, other earlier data, and recent experiments on 
site filling in MF, have led to refinements in how I consider the binding change mechanism  to 
operate. Salient  points from  earlier  data are  that  the  rate of ATP formation during uni-site 
catalysis is much slower than the rate of ATP formation  when rapid  photophosphorylation is 
occurring, and  that during photophosphory- lation  about one  tightly  bound  ATP  per synthase  
is present.  In  previous  de- pictions of  the  mechanism  (Fig. 9) , after a binding  change a 
site is depicted
as  having  a  tightly  bound  ADP  and  Pi  that  is  being  reversibly  converted  to tightly  
bound  ATP,  while waiting for  the  next binding  change. We  now  pro-
pose that during active net  ATP synthesis the interconversion of sites is as de- picted  in Fig. 
10. As a site to which ADP and  Pi  have added  is converted  to a tight site, the capacity for  
the rapid formation  of the  terminal  covalent  bond in  ATP  is also  acquired,  such  that  
essentially  all  the  bound  ADP and  P, are converted  to bound ATP. A site with  tightly bound 
ADP and  P, , as in  Fig. 9, may  not   be  a  compulsory  intermediate.  The  next  rapid  binding 
 change brings about the release of the  ATP to the  medium.
All  ATP  made  in  oxidative  phosphorylation  (118)  or  photophosphoryla- tion  (119, 84)  
contains  about  0.4-1.1  water  oxygens.  This  means  that some rapid  reversal  of ATP formation 
 has occurred. Indeed,  during net oxidative phosphorylation  by  mitochondria,  rapid  reversal  
of  the  overall  process  is demonstrated  by  3*P  measurements  (9,  118) . Thus  it  seems  
likely  that  the rapid incorporation of some water oxygen results from the reversal of a bind-

nucleotides by centrifugation and washing, bound P, drops off and the catalytic site is left with 
tightly bound ADP. This is the ADP that  in  presence  of Mg*’  results in  a strong  inhibition  
of ATPase  activity.

Figure 10. A proposal of how a catalytic site on the ATP synthase is modified by successive bin- 
ding changes. When ADP + P; add to Form 1, and adequate protonmotive force is present, both rapid 
formation and tight binding of ATP arise during Binding Change 1. Most of the site assu- mes the 
conformation of Form 2-S, and the ATP becomes loosely bound in Binding Change 2. When ATP adds to 
Form 3, and to  protonmotive force is present, both rapid formation and tight binding of ADP + P, 
arise during Binding Change 2. Most of the site assumes the conformation of Form 2-H, and the ADP + 
P; become loosely bound during Binding Change I. Both site oc- cupancy on Forms 1 and 3 and 
protonmotive force modulate the quasi-equilibrium of Form 2.

However, when protonmotive force is applied, such tightly bound ADP is re- leased to the medium 
without delay in the first binding change (120).
Other recent experiments pertinent to site occupancy during ATP hydro-
lysis by MFl  were based on competition between ATP and trinitrophenyl-ATP (TNP-ATP) .  They  
revealed  that  TNP-ATP  could  bind  strongly  to  a  third catalytic site for which ATP which had 
a Kg in the millimolar concentration range. The near maximal ATPase rate was attained at 
considerably less than I  mM ATP (121). This result, and further characterization of the transition 
from uni-site to multi-site catalysis and initial velocity measurements, are best explained by the 
filling of only two catalytic  sites being necessary for near
maximal rates of ATP hydrolysis (40). Interestingly, ADP had a considerably
higher  affinity  than ATP for the third empty site of the MFl   Our present hypothesis about 
catalytic site occupancy during rotational catalysis is depict-
ed in Fig. 11. During rapid synthesis one site has a bound ATP and a site to its left (as viewed 
from above the F  portion of the synthase) can preferentially bind ADP and Pi. When adequate 
protonmotive force is present, rapid ATP synthesis ensues. The filling of a third site with ADP and 
Pi at higher substrate concentrations results in little rate acceleration. During net ATP 
hydrolysis, when protonmotive force is weak or absent, the preferential binding of ATP
to a site to the right of the tight ATP site can result in a near maximal hydro- lysis rate. 
Filling of the third site at millimolar concentrations of ATP gives little rate acceleration. 
Nature appears to have designed a way that ATP syn- thesis occurs with ADP addition to a site that 
has low affinity for ATP, helping to obviate ATP inhibition of its own synthesis.

creates many opportunities for gaining a better understanding of this remark- able enzyme. I will 
be an interested spectator in these developments. I believe that societies will, and  should 
continue  to, devote some of  their resources  to basic scientific research,  even if the only 
return is the satisfaction  that comes from the knowledge of how living processes occur. An 
additional justification is that such knowledge underlies past and future gains for attaining a 
healthy life. As summarized  by Ernster  (122) , the oxygen we use to make ATP is also a toxic 
substance, resulting in production of harmful free radicals. The  mito- chondrion  is particularly 
susceptible  to such damage, and  knowledge  of  the enzymes involved  in energy capture  and  use 
may give insight into, and  help find  how to prevent. unwanted  damage.
A final acknowledgment—I am exceptionally  fortunate  to have been  a bio- chemist over  the  past 
decades when  so  much  has been  accomplished  in  my field.  Participation  in  a  series  of  
researches  that  has  revealed  an  unusual rotational catalysis  by a vital enzyme  has been 
warmly gratifying. I am indeb- ted  to the  society that has made  this possible,  to my wife, 
Lyda, for her devo- tion and guidance given freely to help me and  our children find our way, and 
to the  universities  and  government  agencies  that  provided  the environment and  the financial 
support for my researches.
