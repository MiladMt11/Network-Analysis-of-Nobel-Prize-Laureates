AND HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE
• A fundamental study of the properties of transition- metal oxides led to the identification of 
oxide cathodes

• Pushed boundaries at the intersection of solid-state chemistry and physics

• The three classes of materials discovered still remain the only viable cathodes      and the 
basis for future development
- Layered oxide
- Spinel oxide
- Polyanion oxide


RWARD

• Liberating society from fossil fuels

• Harvesting electric power from solar and wind energy

• Electricity storage as chemical energy is the key

• AXordable, safe battery technologies
