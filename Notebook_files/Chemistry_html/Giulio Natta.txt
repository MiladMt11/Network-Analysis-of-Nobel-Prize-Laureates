                                          Introduction


Macromolecular chemistry is a relatively young science. Though natural and
synthetic macromolecular substances had long been known, it was only
between 1920 and 1930 that Hermann Staudinger placed our knowledge of
the chemical structure of several macromolecular substances on a scientific
       1
b a s i s . In the wake of Staudinger’s discoveries and hypotheses, macromolecu-
lar chemistry has made considerable progress.
     Very many synthetic macromolecular substances were prepared both by
polymerization and by polycondensation; methods were found for the regu-
lation of the value and distribution of molecular weights; attempts were made
to clarify the relationships existing among structure, chemical regularity,
molecular weight, and physical and technological properties of the macro-
molecular substances. It was far more difficult to obtain synthetic macromole-
cules having a regular structure from both the chemical and steric points of
view.
     An early result in this field, which aroused a certain interest in relation to
elastomers, was the preparation of a polybutadiene having a very high content
                                                                              2
of trans- 1,4 monomeric units, in the presence of heterogeneous catalysts .
     A wider development of this field was made possible by the recent discovery
of stereospecific polymerization. This led to the synthesis of sterically regular
polymers as well as to that of new classes of crystalline polymers.
     Before referring to the stereospecific polymerizations and to their subse-
quent developments, I wish to make a short report on the particular conditions
that enabled my School to rapidly achieve conclusive results on the genesis and
structure of new classes of macromolecules. I also wish to describe the main
stages of the synthesis and characterization of the first stereoregular polymers
of     - olefins.

     The achievement of these results has also been helped by the research I did
in 1924 when I was a trainee student under the guidance of Professor Bruni. At
that time I began to apply X-ray study of the structures of crystals to the reso -
                                                 3
lution of chemical and structural problems .
     At first, investigations were mainly directed to the study of low-molecular-
weight inorganic substances and of isomorphism phenomena; but, after I had
the luck to meet Professor Staudinger in Freiburg in 1932, I was attracted by
the study of linear high polymers and tried to determine their lattice structures.
     To this end I also employed the electron-diffraction methods which I had
learned from Dr. Seemann in Freiburg and which appeared particularly suit-
                                                         4
able for the examination of thin-oriented films . I applied both X-ray and
electron-diffraction methods also to the study of the structure of the hetero-
geneous catalysts used for certain important organic industrial syntheses, and
thus had the possibility of studying in the laboratory the processes for the syn-
                                                     6
thesis of methanols and the higher alcohols , and also of following their in-
dustrial development in Italy and abroad.
     In view of the experience I had acquired in the field of chemical industry,
certain Italian Government and industrial bodies entrusted me in 1938 with
the task of instituting research and development studies on the production of
synthetic rubber in Italy.
     Thus the first industrial production of butadiene-styrene copolymers was
realized in Italy at the Ferrara plants, where a purely physical process of frac-
tionated absorption was applied for the first time to the separation of buta-
                      7
diene from 1-butene .
     At that time I also began to be interested in the possible chemical applica-
tions of petroleum derivatives, and particularly in the use of olefins and di-
                                                                             8
olefins as raw materials for chemical syntheses such as oxosynthesis a n d
                 9
polymerization .
     The knowledge acquired in the field of the polymerizations of olefins en-
abled me to appreciate the singularity of the methods for the dimerization of
                                          10
α-olefins that Karl Ziegler described in a lecture delivered in Frankfurt in
1952; I was struck by the fact that in the presence of organometallic catalysts it
was possible to obtain only one dimer from each α-olefin, while I knew that
the ordinary, cationic catalysts previously used yielded complex mixtures of
isomers with different structures.
     At this time I also became acquainted with Ziegler’s results on the produc-
tion of strictly linear ethylene oligomers, obtained in the presence of homo-
geneous catalysts. My interest was aroused, and in order to understand better

                                           11
the reaction mechanism , concerning which very little was known, I started
the kinetic study of such polymerizations. In the meantime Ziegler discovered
                                                                                                 12
the process for the low-pressure polymerization of ethylene . I then decided
to focus attention on the polymerization of monomers other than ethylene; in
particular I studied the α -olefins, which were readily available at low cost in
the petroleum industry.
    At the beginning of 1954 we succeded in polymerizing propylene, other
α- o l e f i n s , a n d s t y r e n e ; t h u s w e o b t a i n e d p o l y m e r s h a v i n g v e r y d i f f e r e n t
properties from those shown by the previously known polymers obtained
                                      13
f r o m t h e s e m o n o m e r s . I soon observed that the first crude polymers ofa-
olefins and of styrene, initially obtained in the presence of certain Ziegler
catalysts (TiCl 4 + aluminium alkyls), were not homogeneous, but consisted
of a mixture of different products, some amorphous and non-crystallizable,
others more or less crystalline or crystallizable. Accordingly, I studied the
separation of the different types of polymer by solvent extraction and the
structures of the single separated products. Even if the more soluble polymers
were amorphous and had a molecular weight lower than that of the crystal-
line, but far less soluble, polymers deriving from the same crude product, I
observed that some little-soluble crystalline fractions had a molecular weight
only a little higher than that of other amorphous fractions. Therefore, con-
vinced of the well-known saying natura non facit saltus, I did not attribute crys-
tallinity to a higher molecular weight, but to a different steric structure of the
                                                                                14
macromolecules present in the different fractions .
    In fact all vinyl polymers may be regarded as built from monomeric units
containing a tertiary carbon atom. Thus in a polymer of finite length, such a
carbon atom can be considered asymmetric, and hence two types of mono-
                                                                                     13,15
meric units may exist, which are enantiomorphous                                             .
    Since all the polymers of vinyl hydrocarbons previously known, even those
recognized as having a head-to-tail enchainment like polystyrene, were
amorphous, we examined the possibility that the crystallinity we observed
was due to a chemically regular (head-to-tail) structure, accompanied by
regular succession of steric configurations of the single monomeric units. In-
deed, X-ray analysis permitted us to determine the lattice constants of crys-
                                 16                           17
talline polypropylene                  and polystyrene . The identity period along the chain
axis in the fiber spectra was of about 6.5 Å and might be attributed to a chain
                                                                     18
segment containing three monomeric units . This led us to exclude the idea
that the crystallinity was due to a regular alternation of monomeric units
having opposite steric configuration. Thus it could be foreseen, as was in fact

later proved by more accurate calculations of the structure factors, that the
polymeric chains consisted of regular successions of monomeric units, all
                                                14
 having the same steric configuration .
   In the-subsequent study of the butadiene polymers, prepared by us in the
presence of organometallic catalysts (for example, catalysts containing chro-
        19
m i u m ) that have 1,2-enchainment, two different types of crystalline poly-
mers were isolated and purified.
   The X-ray and electron-diffraction analyses of these products enabled us to
establish that the structure of one of them is analogous to the structures of
                    20
             o l e f i n s -that is, characterized by the repetition of monomeric units
having the same configuration. We also established that the other crystalline
product is characterized by a succession of monomeric units, which are chemi-
                                                                                   21
cally equivalent but have alternately opposite steric configuration , as con-
firmed by a thorough X-ray analysis of the structure. In order to distinguish
these different structures I proposed the adoption of terms coined from the

   Fig. I shows the first device we used for an easy distinction of the different
types of stereoisomerism of vinyl polymers; the main chains have been sup-

   By accurate examination of the structure of isotactic polymers on fiber
spectra, we could establish that all crystalline isotactic polymers have a helical
                                                                                23
structure, analogous to that found by Pauling and Corey for a-keratin
(Fig. 2); in fact only the helix allows a regular repetition of the monomeric

Soon after the first polymerizations of α -olefins we realized the importance
and vastness of the fields that were opened to research, from both the theoret-
ical and the practical points of view.
   Our efforts were then directed to three main fields of research: (1) To in-
vestigate the structures of the new polymers in order-to establish the relation-
ships existing between chemical structure, configuration, and conformation
of the macromolecules in the crystalline state. (2) To find the conditions that
allowed the synthesis of olefinic polyhydrocarbons having a determined type
                                                                                                25
of steric structure, with high yields and high degree of steric regularity , as
well as to study the reaction mechanism, and regulation of the molecular
weight. (3) To attempt the synthesis, possibly in the presence of nonorgano-
metallic catalysts, of stereoregular polymers corresponding to other classes of
monomers having a chemical nature different from that of α-olefins.

The synthesis of new classes of crystalline macromolecules and the X-ray
analysis of their structures led to the formulation of some general rules which
determine the structure of linear macromolecules . Table 1 summarizes some

four-fold or higher order helices exist besides the three-fold ones already
mentioned.

The conformation assumed by the single macromolecules in the lattice al-
ways corresponds to the conformation, or to one of the conformations, of the
isolated molecule that shows the lowest internal energy content, the intra-
molecular Van der Waals forces being taken into account. The mode of pack-

ing of the polymer chains in a crystalline lattice takes place, as in the case of
molecular crystals of low-molecular-weight substances, so as to fill the space
in the best possible way.
   If the polymer chain assumes a helicoidal conformation in the crystalline
state, and if it does not contain asymmetric carbon atoms, it can be expected
that either helices of the same sense, or, in equal ratio, helices of opposite sense
are represented in the lattice.
   Analogous to the case of nonenantiomorphous low-molecular-weight
crystalline substances, so also in polymers that do not contain asymmetric
carbon atoms, right- and left-handed helices are usually represented in the
lattice in equal amount.
   On the other hand, in the case of isotactic polymers containing asymmetric
carbon atoms, the space group will not contain symmetry elements involving
inversion, as, for instance, centers of symmetry or mirror or glide planes.
   A racemic mixture of antipode macromolecules can be an exception. Fur-
thermore, it is interesting to note that the chain symmetry is often maintained
in the space group to which the unit cell of the polymer belongs.
   With regard to the occurrence of enantiomorphous space groups, typical
examples are represented by some isotactic poly-1-alkylbutadienes, in the

crystalline lattice of which macromolecules with helices of exclusively one
                                                              27
sense, right or left, exist for each crystal (Fig. 3). Also in the case of isotactic
poly- tert. -butylacrylate, the helices in the lattice seem to be all of the same
          2 8
sense .
     If the chain symmetry is maintained in the crystal lattice, the possible occur-
rence of different space groups is considerably restricted. Where equal amounts
of enantiomorphous macromolecules are contained in the lattice, we must dis-
tinguish two cases concerning the relative orientation of side groups of enan-
tiomorphous macromolecules facing one another, which can be either iso-
clined or anticlined.
     In the first case, possible symmetry operators for the covering of near
macromolecules are either a mirror plane or a glide plane, parallel to the chain
axis.
     It is, however, known that good packing is generally obtained more easily
with a glide plane than with a mirror plane, especially in the case of bodies
having periodical recesses and prominences, as in the case of spiralized polymer
chains.
     In the case of a three-fold helix, each right-handed helix will be sur-
rounded, because of the existence of the glide plane, by three isoclined left-
handed helices, and vice versa; the space group will be R3c (Fig.4). This lattice
                                                                                 29                    30

                                                                   3
atoms of near chains, must be maintained                               around 4.2 Å.
     In the second case previously considered, in which the relative orientation
of the side groups of enantiomorphous macromolecules facing one another is
anticlined, the only symmetry operator relating neighboring macromolecules
is a symmetry center.
     And again, if the helix is threefold, each right-handed helix will be sur-
rounded, by the action of three symmetry centers at 120°C, by three left-
handed helices, and vice versa; the macromolecules are oriented so as to mini-
mize the length of the unit cell axes perpendicular to the three-fold axis, with
the best possible Van der Waals distances: the space group, which probably is

                                               2. Copolymers


The     "random"      introduction    of    different    monomeric           units    in   a   crystalline
polymer by copolymerization generally causes a decrease in crystallinity and
melting point when their content is lower than 20 to 25 percent, but at higher
content values the copolymer is generally amorphous.
     As we shall remark in the section dealing with the stereoregular polymers of
hydrocarbon monomers containing an internal double bond, it is sometimes
possible to obtain chemically and sterically regular alternating copolymers of
these monomers with ethylene, which are also crystalline. This is the case, for
                                                                                 35
instance,      for        the   alternating      ethylene- cis - 2 - b u t e n e ,     ethylene-cyclopen-
       36                                         37
t e n e , and ethylene-cycloheptene copolymers.
     In these cases, reaction conditions were used in which one of the monomers
is unable to homopolymerize, but can copolymerize to alternating polymers
in the presence of a large excess of the first monomer. Moreover, in the case of
other nonhydrocarbon monomers, crystalline alternating copolymers have
                     38
b e e n o b t a i n e d from two different monomers that are both very reactive in
the presence of stereospecific catalysts (for example, in the copolymerization
                                                                39
of dimethylketene with higher aldehydes ), when the values of the relative
copolymerization rates are much higher than those of homopolymerization.
In the cases mentioned above, the repeating structural unit has the structure of
a polyester obtained by treating a dimethylketene molecule with one mole-
cule of the carbonyl monomer considered.
     Our researches also enabled us to find particular crystalline copolymers,
though with a "random" distribution, when the different monomeric units in
the polymeric chain showed considerable analogies both in chemical nature
and size.
     This phenomenon was defined by us as isomorphism of monomeric units, even
if, in contrast to the isomorphism phenomena of low-molecular-weight sub-
stances, the crystals do not consist of physical mixtures of isomorphous mole-
cules, but of macromolecules in which monomeric units of different type can
substitute each with the other. In this case, copolymers show physical prop-

the composition, and which are intermediate between those of the pure homo-
polymers. This phenomenon was observed in the copolymerization of styrene

to homopolymerize both of them. These are linear copolymers constituted by
successive blocks, each consisting of a chemically and sterically regular suc-

The importance of the stereospecific polymerization - from the standpoint of
both theory and practical applications - is due to the fact that in most cases
(even if not always) the stereoregularity of linear polymers determines crys-
tallinity. When the glass transition temperature and the melting temperature
are very different, the physical and especially the mechanical properties are
very different from those of the corresponding stereoirregular polymers. Due
to such properties, these materials have very interesting practical applications,
either as plastics and textiles when the melting point is high or as elastomers
when the melting point does not considerably exceed the temperature of use.
   The knowledge acquired in these last 10 years in the field of the stereospeci-
ficity of the polymerization processes shows that stereoregular and, in partic-
ular, isotactic polymers can be obtained in the presence of suitable catalysts
acting through an ionic (both anionic and cationic) coordinated mechanism;
however, they cannot generally be obtained by processes characterized by
radical mechanism.
   The catalysts having a higher degree of stereospecificity are characterized
by the presence of metal atoms able to coordinate the monomer molecules in
a stage immediately preceding that of insertion of the monomeric unit
                                                                         43-45
between the end of the growing chain and the catalyst                            .
   In fact, a stereospecific action is shown either by the catalysts containing
metal atoms, the coordinating properties of which are due to their charge and
                                                                                     44

the steric regulation of the polymerization processes. However, the low de-
gree of stereospecificity observed in the radical processes shows that this factor
alone cannot exert a determining action. In any case stereoregularity in these

last processes is of the syndiotactic type and may be attributed also to thermo-
dynamic factors, according to the strong increase in stereospecificity with de-
crease in temperature.
     The first highly stereoregular isotactic polymers were obtained in the pres-
ence of heterogeneous catalysts; however, it soon became clear that the heter-
ogeneity of the catalytic system is an essential factor for the polymerization of
aliphatic olefins to isotactic polymers, but not for the polymerization of other
types of monomers. In fact it was found that aliphatic aldehydes and certain
monomers containing two electron-donor functional groups able to be co-
ordinated (for example, conjugated diolefins, vinyl ethers, alkenyl ethers,
acrylic monomers, styrenes that are substituted differently in the benzene ring,
vinyl pyridine, and so on) can be polymerized in the stereospecific way also
in the presence of soluble catalysts.
     It must be borne in mind that, even if the most typical highly stereospecific
catalysts for the polymerization of α-olefins contain organometallic com-
pounds, some classes of monomers (for example, vinyl ethers) can be poly-
merized to isotactic polymers in the presence of cationic catalysts without
                                                                   49
the presence of organometallic compounds .
     The stereospecificity of the polymerization processes not only depends on
the catalytic system but is a property of each monomer-catalyst system. This
is particularly evident in the case of the polymerization of some conjugated
homologs of diolefins, in which the variation of the monomer changes both
the degree of stereospecificity of the process and, in some cases, the type of
                                                             50
stereoregularity of the polymer obtained .
     Therefore, in order to attain a general view of the present state of the stereo-
specific polymerization, it is helpful to examine the most important results
obtained in each class of monomers.




This is the most studied branch of stereospecific polymerization. As already
mentioned, isotactic polymers of α-olefins have been obtained so far only
with the use of heterogeneous catalysts.
     High stereospecificity is observed only when one employs organometallic
catalysts containing a particular crystalline substrate, such as that deriving
from the violet α,            (ref. 51), and      (ref. 52) modifications of TiCl 3 , having a

yield linear polymers of ethylene, leads to the formation of catalysts having

   Chemical and kinetic studies led to the conclusion that the stereospecific
polymerization of propylene is a polyaddition reaction (stepwise addition),in
which each monomeric unit, on its addition, is inserted on the bond between
an electropositive metal and the electronegative terminal carbon atom of the
growing polymeric chain. This study revealed also that some organometallic
catalysts, which contain only titanium as metal atoms, could be stereospecific
(ref. 58). The first reaction step corresponds to a coordination of the monomer
                                                                                                43,45

Later on, the study of homogeneous catalysts based on vanadium compounds
and on alkyl aluminium monochloride permitted us to synthesize crystalline
polypropylenes with a nonisotactic structure. The detailed development of
this study led to the preparation of catalysts, obtained by treating hydro-
carbon-soluble vanadium compounds (acetylacetonates or vanadium tetra-
chloride) with dialkyl aluminium monochloride. These catalysts yield, at
low temperature, more or less crystalline polymers, free, however, from iso-

  X-Ray analysis, applied to the fiber spectra, permitted us to establish that
this is a syndiotactic polymer; its lattice structure has an identity period of

Polymers of 1-methyl-2-deuteroethylene. The study on the polymerization of
differently deuterated propylenes, undertaken by us in order to arrive at more
certain and univocal attributions of certain bands to the infrared spectrum of
isotactic polypropylene, led us to the discovery of new interesting types of
stereoisomerism in polymers of 1-methyl- 2-deutero-ethylene, and general-
                                                                         68

   In fact, propylenes deuterated in the methylenic group can lead to monomer
units having different steric structure depending on the relative orientation of
t h e C H3 and D substituents. Starting from these deuterated monomers show-

tained. They exhibited the same X-ray spectra but different infrared spectra@.
This means that such polymers possess the same helix structure as normal
isotactic polypropylene, but that the relative orientation of D and CH 3 groups
can lead to a new type of stereoisomerism. In general, starting from a mono-
mer of the CHA=CHB type, three types of stereoregular isomers can be
expected (see Fig. 7).
     The type of stereoisomer obtainable by stereoregular polymerization de-
pends on the mode of presentation and type of opening of the double bond of
each monomer molecule on entering the growing chain (Fig. 8).

crystalline polymers are of ditactic type.

   Ditactic polymers are also obtained from certain monomers containing in-

In the first case, the same stereoisomerism phenomena observed in other vinyl
polymers (for example, isotactic, syndiotactic, and atactic polymers) can be
expected.
   In the second case, each monomeric unit still contains a double bond in the
2-3 position, which can assume cis- or trans -configuration. Thus, four types
of stereoregular polymers could be foreseen "a priori" and precisely: trans-
1 , 4 - , cis -1,4-, isotactic-1,2-, and syndiotactic-1,2-polybutadienes. All four
these stereoisomers were prepared at my Institute with the aid of different

stereospecific catalysts                with a high degree of steric purity (up to above
98 percent), as shown by infrared analysis”.
  X-Ray examination had made it possible for us not only to establish the
steric structure of the different polymers but also to determine the confor-

   The other stereoisomers, having 1,2- or 3,4-enchainment, have not been
prepared as yet in such a degree of steric purity as to yield crystalline products.
In fact, the only known polymer having 3,4-enchainment, obtained in the
presence of the same catalysts yielding syndiotactic 1,2-polybutadiene, is
amorphous.
  1,3-Pentudiene polymers. Unlike butadiene polymers, the stereoregular poly-
mers of 1,3 -pentadiene obtained so far contain at least one asymmetric carbon
atom in the monomer unit. Furthermore, for some of them it is possible to
expect geometric isomers, due to the presence of internal double bonds which
may have cis- or trans -configuration, so that all the polymers will show two
centers of steric isomerism. And in fact polymers having 3,4-enchainment,
containing two asymmetric carbon atoms, show two sites of optical isomer-
ism; all the others exhibit one site of optical isomerism and one of geometric
isomerism (1,2 and 1,4 units).
    On the assumption that only polymers showing stereoregularity in both
possible sites (ditactic polymers) will be crystalline, 11 crystalline pentadiene
polymers can be expected:

Unlike the polymerization of unsatured hydrocarbons, and particularly                                                  -
olefins, the polymerization of monomers containing functional groups, in the
presence of catalysts based on organometallic compounds, has not been
investigated until recently. This is due to the fact that the functional groups
contained in such monomers can react with organometallic catalysts through
reactions that are well known in the field of classical organic chemistry, such
as Grignard reactions, Michael’s reaction, or splitting of an ether bond.
     Initially it was feared that these reactions might involve both deactivation of
the catalytic agent and total or partial alteration of the said monomers.
                                                                                                                85
     In 1956 we demonstrated for the first time in the case of acrylonitrile a n d
its homologs that, by suitably selecting the transition metal compounds and
organometallic compounds forming the catalytic complex, it is possible to
bring about stereospecific, anionic coordinated polymerization of these
monomers while impeding or delaying the above-mentioned side reactions
between monomer and catalyst.
     Therefore, it has been demonstrated that stereospecific polymerization of
nonhydrocarbon monomers can also be carried out with the use of pure
organometallic compounds other than those of the Ziegler type, or even with
the aid of catalytic compounds that do not contain metal-to-carbon bonds.
     The research work on these monomers has taken two separate but parallel
paths; that is, on the one hand it was directed to stereospecific cationic co-
ordinated polymerization and, on the other, to stereospecific anionic poly-
merization (see Tables 5 and 6).
     The cationic coordinated polymerizations carried out by us in the presence
of catalysts of the type of Lewis acids (based on organometallic compounds or
Friedel-Craft catalysts) were chiefly directed to the following classes of mo-

     The polymerization of isobutyl vinyl ethers to crystalline polymers had al-

research work it was possible to attribute their crystallinity to an isotactic

     Stereospecific anionic coordinated polymerization, which is in general car-
ried out in the presence of basic-type catalysts (organometallic or metal amid-
ic compounds, alcoholates) was chiefly investigated in connection with the
                                                                                                           90

   Unlike the α-olefin polymerization, which requires the presence of a cata-
lyst containing a crystalline substrate in order that it may proceed in a stereo-
specific isotactic manner, the polymerization of nonhydrocarbon monomers
containing functional groups or atoms haying free electron pairs (such as, for
example, ethereal, carbonylic, or carboxylic oxygen; aminic, amidic, or ni-
trilic nitrogen) can proceed in a stereospecific way also in the absence of a solid
substrate - that is, in a homogeneous phase. Here the stereospecificity - which
in this case is also connected with a constant orientation and constant mode of
presentation, on polymerizing, of the monomer units with respect to the
growing chain and to the catalytic agent - is due to the coordination of an

electron pair in the monomer with the metal of the catalytic agent by means
                          47,95
of a dative bond                  . As the olefinic double bond too is necessarily bound to
the active center, such monomers appear to be doubly linked to the
complex formed by the catalytic agent and the terminal group of the growing
chain. A predetermined steric orientation is thus made possible.
     Likewise, both the diolefins containing two olefin groups bound to the

                                                                                                                 96
taining a highly electropositive atom with a very small radius (lithium) , can
be polymerized stereospecifically even in the homogeneous phase.
     The coordination of the monomer with the catalytic agent, which is the
indispensable step preceding any stereospecific polymerization both in the
homogeneous and in the heterogeneous phase, has been particularly well
esemplified by the stereospecific polymerization of 2-vinylpyridine in the
                                                                                       97
presence of organometallic compounds of magnesium .
     In fact, the presence of Lewis bases in the polymerization of this monomer
exerts a determining influence on its behavior in the polymerizations. Com-
pounds having a higher degree of basicity than vinylpyridine itself (for ex-
ample, pyridine) form stable coordination compounds with the catalyst, thus
impeding the coordination of the monomer; in this way, not only does the
catalytic activity appear very much reduced, but also the stereospecificity
disappears and the polymer obtained is atactic. Compounds having a lower
degree of basicity than the monomer (aliphatic ethers) compete with the mo-
nomer only in so far as the association with the catalyst is concerned. Accord-
ingly this does not result in the disappearance of the catalyst reactivity, but
only in its reduction along with the degree of stereospecificity of the reaction.
     The asymmetric synthesis of optically active high polymers, starting from
monomers showing no centers of optical-type asymmetry, constituted a par-
ticular, more advanced case of isotactic stereospecific polymerization.




In fact, whereas in the normal stereospecific polymerization to isotactic poly-
mers a succession of monomer units with a given configuration takes place in
each single macromolecule so that enantiomorphous macromolecules in equal
amounts are present in crude polymers, in the case ofasymmetric synthesis one


S T E R E O S P E C I F I C   P O L Y M E R I Z A T I O N    O F    M A C R O M O L E C U L E S   5 3

of the two enantiomorphous isomers of the monomer unit is contained in
higher amounts.
   It should be noted that isotactic high polymers                                    or of other sim-
ple vinyl monomers cannot show detectable optical activity, since an ideal
isotactic polymer of infinite length does not contain asymmetric carbon atoms,
                                                               98
and in isotactic polymers having finite length the optical activity, due to a
difference in the terminal groups, can be detected only in oligomers and de-
creases with increase in the molecular weight. This is due to the fact that the
asymmetry of each asymmetric carbon atom is to be ascribed not to the chemi-
cal difference of contiguous groups linked to the said carbon atom but to a
                                                                        99
difference in length of the chain segments linked to it .
   In fact, in the case of                                optically active polymers were ob-
tained by polymerization only from monomers having an asymmetric carbon
           100
atom .
   On the basis of our investigations it has been possible to obtain optically
active polymers from monomers containing no centers of optical asymmetry
only when, during the polymerization, monomer units are incorporated so
as to develop new asymmetric centers. The asymmetry of the new centers
arises from a difference in the chemical constitution of the groups contiguous
                                            101-104
to the carbon atoms themselves                        .
   Such a result was obtained by means of stereospecific polymerization pro-
cesses, operating under conditions that allow asymmetric induction to favor
the formation of one of the two enantiomorphous structures of the monomer
unit.
   The methods that have led us to the asymmetric synthesis of polymers of
substituted diolefins and of certain heterocyclic, unsaturated compounds are
of two types.
   (1) The first is the use of normal stereospecific catalysts wherein at least one
group bound to the organometallic compound used in the catalyst prepara-
tion, which will be the terminal group of the macromolecules, is optically ac-
     101
t i v e . In this case the asymmetric induction is probably due to the particular
configuration of the terminal group of the growing chain bound to the
catalyst.
   (2) A second method is based on the use of conventional stereospecific cata-
lysts prepared without using optically active alkyls, provided they are com-
                                                                                           102
plexed with optically active Lewis bases, such as β-phenylalanine , or with
                                                                              104
the use of an optically active transition metal compound                            (Table 7).
   In the first case, as the polymerization proceeds, the optical activity de-

creases, as could be expected in view of the fact that any accidental inversion
of configuration exerts an action not confined to one monomer unit only, but
tending to extend to subsequent units.
     In the second case, on the other hand, the induction is due to the asymmetry
                                           1 0 5
of the optically active counterion                 , which maintains its steric structure also
in the case where the asymmetric polymerization gives low optical yields.
     These results can be extended to the interpretation of stereospecific catalysis
of vinyl monomers. They suggest that a higher stereospecificity can be expec-
ted when using catalysts, the active centers of which are per se asymmetric,
than when symmetric catalysts are used, in which the stereospecificity
derives from asymmetric induction brought about by the configuration
assumed by the last polymerized unit.
     Even before the discovery of the asymmetric synthesis of high polymers, we
             106
attributed         the stereospecificity of certain heterogeneous catalysts, prepared
by reaction of solid titanium halides, to the fact that the active centers contain
surface atoms of a transition metal having coordination number 6. In fact it is
known that, in such a case, when at least two of the coordinated groups show
a different chemical nature with respect to the others, enantiomorphous struc-
tures of the surface complexes can exist.
     The high stereospecificity of such catalysts is probably due to the fact that
the initial complex maintains its asymmetry even when linked to the growing
chain.
     An interesting aspect of the asymmetric polymerization of benzofuran


S T E R E O S P E C I F I C    P O L Y M E R I Z A T I O N   O F   M A R O C M O L E C U L E S   5 5




consists in an autocatalytic effect observed in the first reaction period. In fact
it was noticed that the optical activity of the polymers increases as the poly-
                              107
merization      proceeds (Table 8).
   To clarify this phenomenon further, polymerization runs have been per-
formed in the presence of optically active polybenzofuran previously ob-
tained.
   Although the sign of the optical activity always corresponds to that of the
  - phenylalanine complexed with the counter ion, nevertheless the presence
of preformed polymer, obtained in the same polymerization or added to the
catalytic system at the beginning of the polymerization, causes an increase in
the optical activity of the polymer newly formed.
   Such an observation may have an interest that goes beyond the interpreta-
tion of stereospecific polymerization; in fact it can suggest suitable patterns
characteristic of certain biological processes in which the formation of asym-
metric molecules or groups of a given type is connected with the preexistence
of optically active macromolecules.

     but each one is neutralized by another at an equal distance from the center of the
     main chain:




     Hence the fully isotactic polypropylene is a particular case of a meso-configuration
     and must be optically inactive.
