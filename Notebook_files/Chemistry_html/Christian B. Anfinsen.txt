The telegram that I received from the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences
specifically cites ". . . studies on ribonuclease, in particular the relationship
between the amino acid sequence and the biologically active conformation...”
The work that my colleagues and I have carried out on the nature of the process
that controls the folding of polypeptide chains into the unique three-dimen-
sional structures of proteins was, indeed, strongly influenced by observations
on the ribonuclease molecule, Many others, including Anson and Mirsky (1)
in the '30s and Lumry and Eyring (2) in the ‘50s, had observed and discussed
the reversibility of denaturation of proteins. However, the true elegance of this
consequence of natural selection was dramatized by the ribonuclease work,
since the refolding of this molecule, after full denaturation by reductive cleav-
age of its four disulfide bonds (Figure 1), required that only one of the 105

possible pairings of eight sulfhydryl groups to form four disulfide linkages take
place. The original observations that led to this conclusion were made together
with my colleagues, Michael Sela and Fred White, in 1956-1957 (6). These
were in actuality, the beginnings of a long series of studies that rather vaguely
aimed at the eventual total synthesis of the protein. As we all know, Gutte
and Merrifield (7) at the Rockefeller Institute, and Ralph Hirschman and
his colleagues at the Merck Research Institute (8), have now accomplished
this monumental task.
   The studies on the renaturation of fully denatured ribonuclease required
many supporting investigations (9, 10, 11, 12) to establish, finally, the generality
which we have occasionally called (13) the “thermodynamic hypothesis”.
 This hypothesis states that the three-dimensional structure of a native
 protein in its normal physiological milieu (solvent, pH, ionic strength,
presence of other components such as metal ions or prosthetic groups, tempera-
ture, etc.) is the one in which the Gibbs free energy of the whole system is
lowest; that is, that the native conformation is determined by the totality of
interatomic interactions and hence by the amino acid sequence, in a given
environment. In terms of natural selection through the “design” of macromole-
cules during evolution, this idea emphasized the fact that a protein molecule
only makes stable, structural sense when it exists under conditions similar to
those for which it was selected - the so-called physiological state.
   After several years of study on the ribonuclease molecule it became clear
to us, and to many others in the field of protein conformation, that proteins
devoid of restrictive disulfide bonds or other covalent cross linkages would make
more convenient models for the study of the thermodynamic and kinetic
aspects of the nucleation, and subsequent pathways, of polypeptide chain
folding. Much of what I will review will deal with studies on the flexible and
convenient staphylococcal nuclease molecule, but I will first summarize some
of the older, background experiments on bovine pancreatic ribonuclease itself.

An experiment that gave us a particular satisfaction in connection with the
translation of information in the linear amino acid sequence into native con-
formation involved the rearrangement of so-called “scrambled” ribonuclease
(12). When the fully reduced protein, with 8 SH groups, is allowed to reoxidize
under denaturing conditions such as exist in a solution of 8 molar urea, a
mixture of products is obtained containing many or all of the possible 105
 isomeric disulfide bonded forms (schematically shown at the bottom right of
 Figure 2). This mixture is essentially inactive - having on the order of 1%
the activity of the native enzyme. If the urea is removed and the “scrambled”
protein is exposed to a small amount of a sulfhydryl group-containing reagent
such as mercaptoethanol, disulfide interchange takes place and the mixture
eventually is converted into a homogeneous product, indistinguishable from
native ribonuclease. This process is driven entirely by the free energy of con-
formation that is gained in going to the stable, native structure. These experi-

ments, incidentally, also make unlikely a process of obligatory, progressive
folding during the elongation of the polypeptide chain, during biosynthesis,
from the NH2- to the COOH-terminus. The “scrambled” protein appears to be
essentially devoid of the various aspects of structural regularity that character-
ize the native molecule.
   A disturbing factor in the kinetics of the process of renaturation of reduced
ribonuclease, or of the “unscrambling” experiments described above, was the
slowness of these processes, frequently hours in duration (11). It had been
established that the time required to synthesize the chain of a protein like
ribonuclease, containing 124 amino acid residues, in the tissues of a higher
organism would be approximately 2 minutes (14, 15). The discrepancy between
the in vitro and in vivo rates led to the discovery of an enzyme system in the
endoplasmic reticulum of cells (particularly in those concerned with the secre-
tion of extracellular, SS-bonded proteins) which catalyzes the disulfide inter-
change reaction and which, when added to solutions of reduced ribonuclease
or to protein containing randomized SS bonds, catalyzed the rapid formation
of the correct, native disulfide pairing in a period less than the requisite two
minutes (16, 17). The above discrepancy in rates would not have been observed
in the case of the folding of non-crosslinked structures and, as discussed below,
such motile proteins as staphylococcal nuclease or myoglobin can undergo
virtually complete renaturation in a few a seconds or less.
   The disulfide interchange enzyme subsequently served as a useful tool for
the examination of the thermodynamic stability of disulfide-bonded protein

structures. This enzyme, having a molecular weight of 42,000 and containing
three half-cystine residues, one of which must be in the SH form for activity
(18, 19), appears to carry out its rearranging activities on a purely random
basis. Thus, a protein whose SS bonds have been deliberately broken and re-
formed in an incorrect way, need only be exposed to the enzyme (with its
essential half-cystine residue in the pre-reduced, SH form) and interchange
of disulfide bonds occurs until the native form of the protein substrate is
reached. Presumably, SS bonds occupying solvent-exposed, or other ther-
modynamically unfavorable positions, are constantly probed and progressively
replaced by more favorable half-cystine pairings, until the enzyme can no
longer contact bonds because of steric factors, or because no further net
decrease in conformational free energy can be achieved. Model studies on
ribonuclease derivatives had shown that, when the intactness of the genetic
message represented by the linear sequence of the protein was tampered with
by certain cleavages of the chain, or by deletions of amino acids at various
points, the added disulfide interchange enzyme, in the course of its “probing”,
discovered this situation of thermodynamic instability and caused the random
reshuffling of SS bonds with the formation of an inactive cross-linked network
of chains and chain fragments (e.g., (20) ). With two naturally occurring
proteins, insulin and chymotrypsin, the interchange enzyme did, indeed, induce
such a randomizing phenomenon (21). Chymotrypsin, containing three SS-
bonded chains, is known to be derived from a single-chained precursor, chy-
motrypsinogen, by excision of two internal bits of sequence. The elegant studies
of Steiner and his colleagues subsequently showed that insulin was also derived
from a single-chained precursor, proinsulin (Figure 3) which is converted to

moval of a segment from the middle of the precursor strand after formation of
the 3 SS bonds (22). In contrast, the multichained immune globulins are not
scrambled and inactivated by the enzyme, reflecting the fact that they are
normal products of the disulfide bonding of 4 preformed polypeptide chains.



F ACTORS   CONTRIBUTING     TO   THE   CORRECT   FOLDING    OF   POLYPEPTIDE    C H A I N S.

The results with the disulfide interchange enzyme discussed above suggested
that the correct and unique translation of the genetic message for a particular
protein backbone is no longer possible when the linear information has been
tampered with by deletion of amino acid residues. As with most rules, however,
this one is susceptible to many exceptions. First, a number of proteins have
been shown to undergo reversible denaturation, including disulfide bond rup-
ture and reformation, after being shortened at either the NH2 - or COOH-
terminus (23). Others may be cleaved into two (24, 25, 26), or even three,
fragments which, although devoid of detectable structure alone in solution,
recombine through noncovalent forces to yield biologically active structures
with physical properties very similar to those of the parent protein molecules.
Richards and his colleagues (24) discovered the first of these recombining
systems, ribonuclease-S (RNase-S), which consists of a 20 residue fragment
from the NH2-terminal end held by a large number of noncovalent interactions
to the rest of the molecule, which consists of 104 residues and all four of the
disulfide bridges. The work by Wyckoff, Richards and their associates on the
three-dimensional structure of this two-fragment complex (27) and on the identi-
fication of many of the amino acid side chains that are essential for comple-
mentation is classical, as are studies by Hofmann (28) and Scoffone (29) and
their colleagues on semi-synthetic analogues of this enzyme derivative. Studies
in our own laboratory (30) showed that the 20 residue “RNase-S-peptide”

fragment could be reduced by 5 residues at its COOH-terminus without loss
of enzymic activity in the complex, or of its intrinsic stability in solution.
   Other examples of retention of native structural “memory” have been found
with complexing fragments of the staphylococcal nuclease molecule (25, 31).
This calcium-dependent, RNA and DNA cleaving enzyme (Figure 4) consists
of 149 amino acids and is devoid of disulfide bridges and SH groups (32, 33).
Although it exhibits considerable flexibility in solution as evidenced by the
ready exchange of labile hydrogen atoms in the interior of the molecule with
solvent hydrogen atoms (34), only a very small fraction of the total population
deviates from the intact, native format at any moment. Spectral and hydro-
dynamic measurements indicate marked stability up to temperatures of approxi-
mately 55°. The protein is greatly stabilized, both against hydrogen exchange
(34) and against digestion by proteolytic enzymes (35) when calcium ions and the
inhibitory ligand, 3’5’-thymidine diphosphate (pdTp), are added. Trypsin, for
 example, then only cleaves at very restricted positions - the loose amino terminal
 portion of the chain and a loop of residues that protrudes out from the molecule as
visualized by X-ray crystallography. Cleavage occurs between lysine residues 5
and 6 and, in the sequence -Pro-Lys-Lys-Gly- (residues 47 through 50) between
residues 48 and 49 or 49 and 50 (25). The resulting fragments (6 - 48) and (49 -
149) or (50 - 149) are devoid of detectable structure in solution (36). However,
as in the case of RNase-S, when they are mixed in stoichiometric amounts
regeneration of activity (about 10 %) and of native structural characteristics
occurs (the complex is called nuclease-T). Nuclease-T has now been shown
(37a) to be closely isomorphous with native nuclease (37b). Thus the cleavages

and deletions do not destroy the geometric “sense” of the chain. Recently
it was shown that residue 149 may be removed by carboxypeptidase treatment
of nuclease, and that residues 45 through 49 are dispensible, the latter con-
clusion the result of solid phase-synthetic studies (38) on analogues of the
fragment, (6-47).
   Earlier studies by David Ontjes (39) had established that the rapid and
convenient solid-phase method developed by Merrifield (40) for peptide syn-
thesis could be applied to the synthesis of analogues of the (6-47) fragment
of nuclease-T. The products, although contaminated by sizeable amounts of
 “mistake sequences” which lack an amino acid residue due to slight incom-
 pleteness of reaction during coupling, could be purified by ordinary chromato-
graphic methods to a stage that permitted one to make definite conclusions
about the relative importance of various components in the chain. Taking
advantage of the limited proteolysis that occurs when nuclease is treated with
trypsin in the presence of the stabilizing ligands, calcium and pdTp, Chaiken
(41) was able to digest away those aberrant synthetic molecules of (6-47)
that did not form a stable complex with the large, native fragment, (49-149).
After digestion of the complex, chromatography on columns of phospho-
cellulose (Figure 5) yielded samples of semisynthetic nuclease-T that were essen-
tially indistinguishable from native nuclease-T. For example, the large enhance-
ment of fluorescence of the single tryptophan residue in nuclease (located at
position 140 in the (50-149) fragment) upon addition of the native (6-49)
fragment was also shown when, instead, synthetic (6-47) peptide isolated
from semisynthetic nuclease-T that had been purified as described above was
added (Figure 6).

  The dispensability, or replaceability, of a number of residues to the stability
of the nuclease-T complex was established by examining the fluorescence,
activity, and stability to enzymatic digestion, of a large number of semisynthetic
analogues (42). As illustrated in Figure 7, interaction with the calcium atom
required for nuclease activity normally requires the participation of four
dicarboxylic amino acids. Although the activities of complexes containing
synthetic (6-47) fragments in which one of these had been replaced with an
asparagine or glutamine residue were abolished (with one partial exception-
asparagine at position 40), three dimensional structure and complex stability
was retained for the most part. Similarly, replacement of arginine residue 35
with lysine yielded an inactive complex, but nevertheless one with strong three
dimensional similarity to native nuclease-T.
  A second kind of complementing system of nuclease fragments (31) consists
of tryptic fragment (1 - 126) and a partially overlapping section of the se-
quence, (99-149), prepared by cyanogen bromide treatment of the native
molecule (shown schematically in Figure 8). These two peptides form a com-
plex with about 15% the activity of nuclease itself which is sufficiently stable
in the presence of pdTp and calcium ions to exhibit remarkable resistance to
digestion by trypsin. Thus, many of the overlapping residues in the complex,

(1-126): (99-149) may be “trimmed” away with the production of a deriva-
tive, (1-126): (111-149). Further degradation of each of the two compo-
nents, the former with carboxypeptidases A and B and the latter with leucine
aminopeptidase, permits the preparation of (1-124): (114-149) which is as
active, and as structurally similar to native nuclease, (as evidenced by esti-
mates of hydrodynamic, spectral, and helical properties) as the parent, un-
degraded complex. A number of synthetic analogues of the (114-149)
sequence have been prepared (43), which also exhibit activity and “native”
physical properties when added to (1-126). I will discuss below the manner
in which these complexing fragments have been useful in devising experiments
to study the processes of nucleation and folding of polypeptide chains.

Biological function appears to be more a correlate of macromolecular geometry
than of chemical detail. The classic chemical and crystallographic work on the
large number of abnormal human hemoglobins, the species variants of cyto-
chrome c and other proteins from a very large variety of sources, and the isola-
tion of numerous bacterial proteins after mutation of the corresponding genes
have made it quite clear that considerable modification of protein sequence
may be made without loss of function. In those cases where crystallographic
studies of three-dimensional structure have been made, the results indicate
that the geometric problem of “designing,” through natural selection, mole-
cules that can subserve a particular functional need can be solved in many
ways. Only the geometry of the protein and its active site need be conserved,
except, of course, for such residues as actually participate in a unique way in
a catalytic or regulatory mechanism (44). Studies of model systems have led

to similar conclusions. In our own work on ribonuclease, for example, it was
shown that fairly long chains of poly-D, L-alanine could be attached to eight
of the eleven amino groups of the enzyme without loss of enzyme activity (45).
Furthermore, the polyalanylated enzyme could be converted to an extended
chain by reduction of the four SS bridges in 8 M urea and this fully denatured
material could then be reoxidized to yield the active, correctly folded starting
substance. Thus, the chemistry of the protein could be greatly modified, and
its capacity to refold after denaturation seemed to be dependent only on internal
residues and not those on the outside, exposed to solvent. This is, of course,
precisely the conclusion reached by Perutz and his colleagues (46), and by
others (47) who have reviewed and correlated the data on various protein sys-
tems. Mutation and natural selection are permitted a high degree of freedom
during the evolution of species, or during accidental mutation, but a limited
number of residues, destined to become involved in the internal, hydrophobic
core of proteins, must be carefully conserved (or at most replaced with other
residues with a close similarity in bulk and hydrophobicity).

TH E   COOPERATIVITY   REQUIRED   FOR   FOLDING    AND   STABILITY   OF   PROTEINS.

The examples of non-covalent interaction of complementing fragments of
proteins quoted above give strong support to the idea of the essentiality of
cooperative interactions in the stability of protein structure. As in the basic
rules of languages, an incomplete sentence frequently conveys only gibberish.
There appears to exist a very fine balance between stable, native protein
structure and random, biologically meaningless polypeptide chains.
   A very good example of the inadequacy of an incomplete sequence comes
from our observations on the nuclease fragment, (1-126). This fragment
contains all of the residues that make up the active center of nuclease. Neverthe-
less, this fragment, representing about 85 % of the total sequence of nuclease,
exhibits only about 0.12 % the activity of the native enzyme (48). The further

addition of 23 residues during biosynthesis, or the addition, in vitro, of residues
99 - 149 as a complementing fragment (31), restores the stability required
for activity to this unfinished gene translation.
   The transition from incomplete, inactive enzyme, with random structure,
to competent enzyme, with unique and stable structure, is clearly a delicately
balanced one. The sharpness of this transition may be emphasized by experi-
ments of the sort illustrated in Figure 9. Nuclease undergoes a dramatic
change from native globular structure to random disoriented polypeptide over
a very narrow range of pH, centered at pH 3.9. The transition has the appear-
ance of a “two-stage” process - either all native or all denatured - and, indeed
two-state mathematical treatment has classically been employed to describe
such data. In actuality, it has been possible to show, by NMR and spectro-
photometric-experiments (49), that one of the 4 histidines and one tyrosine
residue of the 7 in nuclease become disoriented before the general and sudden
disintegration of organized structure. However, such evidences of a stepwise
denaturation and renaturation process are certainly not typical of the bulk
of the cooperatively stabilized molecule.
   The experiments in Figure 9, involving measurements of intrinsic vicosity
and helix-dependent circular dichroism, are typical of those obtained with
most proteins. In the case of nuclease, not only is the transition from native to
denatured molecule during transfer from solution at pH 3.2 to 6.7 very abrupt,
but the process of renaturation occurs over a very short time period. I will not
discuss these stop-flow kinetic experiments (50) in detail in this lecture. In
brief, the process can be shown to take place in at least two phases ; an initial rapid
nucleation and folding with a half-time of about 50 milliseconds and a second,
somewhat slower transformation with a half time of about 200 milliseconds.
The first phase is essentially temperature independent (and therefore possibly

A chain of 149 amino acid residues with two rotatable bonds per residue, each
bond probably having 2 or 3 permissible or favored orientations, would be able
to assume on the order of 4149 to 9 149 different conformations in solution. The
extreme rapidity of the refolding makes it essential that the process take
place along a limited number of “pathways”, even when the statistics are
severely restricted by the kinds of stereochemical ground rules that are implicit
in a so-called Ramachandran plot. It becomes necessary to postulate the exis-
tence of a limited number of allowable initiating events in the folding process.
Such events, generally referred to as nucleations, are most likely to occur in
parts of the polypeptide chain that can participate in conformational equilibria
between random and cooperatively stabilized arrangements. The likelihood
of a requirement for cooperative stabilization is high because, in aqueous
solution, ionic or hydrogen bonded interactions would not be expected to com-
pete effectively with interactions with solvent molecules and anything less
than a sizeable nucleus of interacting amino acid side chains would probably
have a very short lifetime. Furthermore, it is important to stress that the

subjective proposal).




amino acid sequences of polypeptide chains designed to be the fabric of protein
molecules only make functional sense when they are in the three dimensional
arrangement that characterizes them in the native protein structure. It seems rea-
sonable to suggest that portions of a protein chain that can serve as nucleation
sites for folding will be those that can “flicker” in and out of the conformation
that they occupy in the final protein, and that they will form a relatively rigid
structure, stabilized by a set of cooperative interactions. These nucleation cen-
ters, in what we have termed their “native format”, (Figure 10) might be
expected to involve such potentially self-dependent substructures as helices,
pleated sheets or beta-bends.
   Unfortunately, the methods that depend upon hydrodynamic or spectral
measurements are not able to detect the presence of these infrequent and
transient nucleations. To detect the postulated “flickering equilibria” and to
determine their probable lifetimes in solution requires indirect methods that
will record the brief appearance of individual “native format” molecules in
the population under study. One such method, recently used in our laboratory
in a study of the folding of staphylococcal nuclease and its fragments, employs
specific antibodies against restricted portions of the amino acid sequence (51).
   Figure 8 depicts the three dimensional pattern assumed by staphylococcal
nuclease in solution. Major features involving organized structure are the
three-stranded antiparallel pleated sheet approximately located between resi-
dues 12 and 35, and the three alpha-helical regions between residues 54-67,
99-106 and 121-134. Antibodies against specific regions of the nuclease
molecule were prepared by immunization of goats with either polypeptide

fragments of the enzyme or by injection of the intact, native protein with
subsequent fractionation of the resulting antibody population on affinity
chromatography columns consisting of agarose bearing the covalently attached
peptide fragment of interest (51, 52). In the former manner there was prepared,
for example, an antibody directed against the polypeptide, residues 99-149,
known to exist in solution as a random chain without the extensive helicity
that characterizes this portion of the nuclease chain when present as part of
the intact enzyme. Such an antibody preparation is referred to as anti-(99-
149)r, the subscript indicating the disordered state of the antigen.
   When, on the other hand, a fraction of anti-native nuclease serum, isolated
on an agarose-nuclease column, was further fractionated on agarose-(99-149),
a fraction was obtained which was specific for the sequence (99-149) but
presumably only when this bit of sequence occupied the “native format”.
This latter conclusion is based on the observation that the latter fraction, termed
anti-(99-149) n (the subscript “n” referring to the native format) exhibited a
strong inhibitory effect on the enzymic activity of nuclease whereas anti-(99-
126), or anti-(99-149)r were devoid of such an effect (see Figure 11). This
conclusion was further supported by the observation that the conformation-
-stabilizing ligands, pdTp and calcium ions, showed a market inhibitory effect
on the precipitability of nuclease by anti-(1 - 126) r and anti-(99-149) r but
had little effect, if any on such precipitability by anti-(1-149)n (51). This
finding reinforced the idea that many of the antigenic determinants recognized
by the anti-fragment antibodies are present only in the “unfolded” or “non-
native” conformation of nuclease. Analysis of the reaction between anti-
(99 - 149) and nuclease could be shown by measurements of changes in the

   The system may be described by two simultaneous equilibria, the first
concerned with the “flickering” of fragment (99-149) which we shall term
"P", from random to native “format”, and the second with the association of
a n t i - ( 9 9 - 1 4 9 ) n , which we shall term, simply, “Ab” with fragment P in its

DNA substrate by a standard amount of nuclease added to the preincubated
mixture of fragment (99-149) and anti-(99-149)n. Making the assumption
that the affinity of anti-(99-149) n for (99-149)n in its folded (P) form is the
same as that determined for this antigenic determinant in native nuclease,
the value for the term Kconf . may be calculated from measureable para-
meters. A series of typical values shown in Table 1, suggests that approxi-
 mately 0.02% of fragment (99-149) exists in the native format at any
 moment. Such a value, although low, is very large relative to the likelihood of a
peptide fragment of a protein being found in its native format on the basis of
chance alone.
   Empirical considerations of the large amount of data now available on
correlations between sequence and three dimensional structure (54), together
with an increasing sophistication in the theoretical treatment of the energetics
of polypeptide chain folding (55) are beginning to make more realistic the
idea of the a priori prediction of protein conformation. It is certain that major
advances in the understanding of cellular organization, and of the causes and
control of abnormalities in such organization, will occur when we can pre-
dict, in advance, the three dimensional, phenotypic consequences of a genetic
message.
