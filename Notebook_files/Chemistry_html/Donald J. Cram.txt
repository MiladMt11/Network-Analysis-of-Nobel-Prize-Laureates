Origins
Few scientists acquainted with the chemistry of biological systems at the
molecular level can avoid being inspired. Evolution has produced chemical
compounds exquisitely organized to accomplish the most complicated and
delicate of tasks. Many organic chemists viewing crystal structures of enzyme
systems or nucleic aids and knowing the marvels of specificity of the immune
systems must dream of designing and synthesizing simpler organic compounds
that imitate working features of these naturally occurring compounds. We had
that ambition in the late 1950’s. At that time, we were investigating p i -
complexes of the larger [m.n.]paracyclophanes with (NC) 2 C = C ( C N )2 , and
envisioned structures in which the pi-acid was sandwiched by two benzene
rings. Although no intercalated structures were observed [1,2], we recognized
that investigations of highly structured complexes would be central to simula-
tion of enzymes by relatively simple organic compounds.
   In 1967, Pedersen’s first papers appeared [3,4] which reported that alkali
metal ions bind crown ethers to form highly structured complexes. We immedi-
ately recognized this work as an entree into a general field. The 1969 papers on
the design, synthesis, and binding properties of the cryptands by J.-M. Lehn,
J.-P. Sauvage, and B. Dietrich [5,6] further demonstrated the attractions and
opportunities of complexation chemistry. Although we tried to interest grad-
uate students in synthesizing chiral crown ethers from 1968 on, the efforts were
unsuccessful. In 1970 we insisted that several postdoctoral co-workers enter the
field. During 1973, we published five Communications on the subject [7,11]. In
 1974 with Jane M. Cram, we published a general article entitled “Host-Guest
Chemistry”, which defined our approach to this research [12].
   Aeschylus, the Athenian Poet-Dramatist, wrote 2 500 years ago, “Pleasantist
of all ties is the tie of host and guest” [13]. O ur research of the past 17 years has
dealt with the pleasant tie between host and guest and the organic molecular
level. The terms host, guest, complex , and their binding forces were defined in
 1977 as follows [14]. “Complexes are composed of two or more molecules or

ions held together in unique structural relationships by electrostatic forces
other than those of full covalent bonds . . . molecular complexes are usually held
together by hydrogen bonding, by ion pairing, by pi-acid to pi-base interac-
tions, by metal to ligand binding, by van der Waals attractive forces, by solvent
reorganizing, and by partially made and broken covalent bonds (transition
states) high structural organization is usually produced only through multi-
ple binding sites a highly structured molecular complex is composed of at
least one host and one guest component . . a host-guest relationship involves a

complementary stereoelectronic arrangement of binding sites in host and guest
 ... the host component is defined as an organic molecule or ion whose binding
sites converge in the complex the guest component is defined as any molecule
or ion whose binding sites diverge in the complex...” In these definitions, hosts
are synthetic counterparts of the receptor sites of biological chemistry, and
guests, the counterparts of substrates, inhibitors, or cofactors. These terms and
concepts have gained broad international acceptance [15]. A new field requires
new terms which, if properly defined, facilitate the reasoning by analogy on
which research thrives.
    From the beginning, we used Corey-Pauling-Koltun (CPK) molecular mod-
els [16], which served as a compass on an otherwise uncharted sea full of
synthesizable targtt complexes. We have spent hundreds of hours building
CPK models of potential complexes, and grading them for desirability as
research targets. Hosts were then prepared by my co-workers to see if they
possessed the anticipated guest-binding properties. Crystal structures of the
hosts and their complexes were then determined to compare what was antici-
pated by model examination with what was experimentally observed. By the
end of 1986, Drs. K. N. Trueblood, C. B. Knobler, E. F. Maverick, and I.
Goldberg, working at UCLA, had determined the crystal structures of over 50
complexes, and those of another 25 hosts. These crystal structures turned our
faith into confidence. Chart I traces the steps involved in linking the structures
of biotic complexes of evolutionary chemistry with our abiotic complexes designed
with the aid of CPK molecular models [17].

   In molecular modeling, we made extensive use of the self-evident principle of
complementarity: “to complex, hosts must have binding sites which coopera-
tively contact and attract binding sites of guests without generating strong
nonbonded repulsions” [18]. Complexes were visualized as having three types
of common shapes: 1) perching complexes, resembling a bird perching on a
limb, an egg protruding from an egg cup, or a scoop of ice cream sitting on a
cone; 2) nesting complexes, similar to an egg resting in a nest, a baby lying in
its cradle, or a sword sheathed in its scabbard; 3) capsular complexes, not
unlike a nut in its shell, a bean in its pod, or a larva in its cocoon. Chart II
provides a comparison of CPK models of the three types of complexes (1, 2,
and 3) and their actual crystal structures [19,20].

    Principle of Preorganization
    Crystal structures of Pedersen’s 18-crown-6 [21] and Lehn’s [2.2.2] cryptand
    [22,23] show that in their uncomplexed states, they contain neither cavities nor
    convergently-arranged binding sites. Comparisons of the crystal structure of
    host 4 with that of its K+ complex 5, and of host 6 with that of its K+ c o m p l e x
    7 indicate that the complexing act must be accompanied by host reorganization
    and desolvation.

       With the help of CPK molecular models, we designed ligand system 8, whose
    oxygens have no choice but to be octahedrally arranged around an enforced
    spherical cavity complementary to Li + and Na ions. We have given the family
                                                          +

    spheraplex, to their complexes, which like 7, are capsular [24]. The syntheses
    and crystal structures of 8, 9 and 10, have been reported [25]. As expected, the
    crystal structure of 1 1 contains a hole lined with 24 electrons, which are
    shielded from solvation by six methyl groups. The snowflake-like structures of
    11 and of spheraplexes 12 and 13 are nearly identical. Thus 8 is the first ligand
    system to be designed and synthesized which was completely organized for
    complexation during synthesis, rather than during complexation.

a n d D2 O at 25          in the presence and absence of host. From the results, K a
( m o l- 1) and           values (kcal mol - 1) were calculated (equations (1)). This
method was rapid and convenient for obtaining

saturated with D 2O [26]. Higher values (up to 22 kcal mol - 1 ) were obtained by
equilibration experiments between complexes of known and those of unknown
          values [18, 27, 28]. Others were determined from measured k -l and k 1
values, all in the same medium at 25               [18]. Spherand 8 binds LiPic with >23
kcal mol , NaPic with 19.3 kcal mol , and totally rejects the other standard

ions, as well as a wide variety of other di- and trivalent ions [18]. The open-
chain counterpart of 8, podand 14, binds LiPic and NaPic with                             <6 kcal
m o l-1 [29]. Podand is the family name given to acylic hosts [15].
   Podand 14 differs constitutionally from spherand 8 only in the sense that 14
contains two hydrogen atoms in place of one Ar-Ar bond in 8. The two hosts
differ radically in their conformational structures and states of solvation. The
spherand possesses a single conformation ideally arranged for binding Li + a n d
N a+ . Its oxygens are deeply buried within a hydrocarbon shell. The orbitals of
their unshared electron pairs are in a microenvironment whose dielectric
properties are between those of a vacuum and of a hydrocarbon. No solvent can
approach these six oxygens, which remain unsolvated. The free energy costs of

organizing the spherand into a single conformation and of desolvating its six
oxygens were paid for during its synthesis. Thus spherand 8 is preorganized for
binding [30]. The podand in principle can exist in over 1 000 conformations,
only two of which can bind metal ions octahedrally. The free energy for
organizing the podand into a binding conformation and desolvating its six
oxygens must come out of its complexation free energy. Thus the podand is not
preorganized for binding, but is randomized to maximize the entropy of mixing
of its conformers, and to maximize the attractions between solvent and its
molecular parts.
   The difference in                        values for spherand 8 and podand 14 binding Li + is
> 1 7 k c a l m o l- 1, corresponding to a difference in K a of a factor of >10 . The

corresponding to a difference in K a of a factor of >1010 . These differences are
dramatically larger than any we have encountered that are associated with
other effects on binding power toward alkali metal ion guests. We conclude that
preorganization is a central determinant of binding power. We formalized this conclu-
sion in terms of what we call the principle of preorganization, which states that
“the more highly hosts and guests are organized for binding and low solvation
prior to their complexation, the more stable will be their complexes.” Both
enthalpic and entropic components are involved in preorganization, since
solvation contains both components [29]. Furthermore, binding conformations
are sometimes enthalpically rich. For example, the benzene rings in spherand 8
and spheraplexes 9 and 10 are somewhat folded from their normal planar
structures to accommodate the spacial requirements of the six methoxyl groups
[30]. The anisyl group is an intrinsically poor ligand [31, 32]. That 8 is such a
strong binder provides an extreme example of the power of preorganization.
   Families of hosts generally fall into the order of their listing in Chart III
when arranged according to their                                 values with which they bind their
most complementary guests: spherands > cryptaspherands > cryptands >
hemispherands > corands > podands. Corand is the family name given to
modified crown ethers [33]. Spheraplex                              Li+ provides a             value, of >23

the numbers of binding sites and their characters certainly influence these
values, the degree of preorganization appears to be dominant in providing this
order.

    Structural Recognition
    Just as preorganization is the central determinant of binding power, comple-
    mentarity is the central determinant of structural recognition. The binding
    energy at a single contact site is at most a few kilocalories per mole, much lower
    than that of a covalent bond. Contacts at several sites between hosts and guests
    are required for structuring of complexes. Such contacts depend on comple-
    mentary placements of binding sites in the complexing partners.
         The most extensive correlations of structural recognition with host-guest
    structure involve the K a values with which the spherands, cryptaspherands,
    cryptands, and hemispherands associate with the various alkali metal picrate
      salts at 25      i n C D C l3 saturated with D 2 O. Chart IV lists the K a A / Ka A' ratios
    for various hosts binding two alkali metal ions A and A’that are adjacent to one
     another in the periodic table [33]. Notice that factors as high as > 10 1 0 a r e
     observed for the spherands binding Na + better than K . Cryptasphcrand 15

     provides a factor of 13,000. The highest factors for hosts binding K + better
     t h a n N a+ are observed for cryptaspherand 17 (11,000) and hemispherand 22
     (2000). The highest factors for a host binding Li+ o v e r N a+ a r e f o u n d f o r
     cryptand 18 (4,800). Th ese particular selectivities arc important because of the

physiological importance of these ions. These hosts, or modifications of them,
are being developed for commercial use in the medical diagnostics industry.
  Chart V provides stereoviews of crystal structures of capsular complexes
   N a+ ,   N a+ , and    K+ . Notice that in     N a+ a n d  K+ t h e m e t a l
ions contact all of the heteroatoms, whereas in                     N a+ , the Na+ ion does not.
Here is a visual example of complementarity vs. noncomplementarity. The
Ka/K,*’ ratio for                                   = 11,000 [34].
   Arrangement of the classes of hosts in decreasing order of their ability to
select between the alkali metal ion guests provides spherands > cryptaspher-
a n d s ~ c r y p t a n d s > h e m i s p h e r a n d s > c orands > podands. This order is
similar but less rigidly followed than that for host preorganization. In some
cases, rather small changes in structure provide a substantial spread in -∆Gº
values for binding under our standard conditions [33].
   Chiral recognition in complexation is a fundamental aspect of structural
recognition in complexation in the biotic world. We synthesized host 25 in an
enantiomerically pure form to study its ability to distinguish between enan-
tiomers in complexation of amino acids and ester salts in solution. We were
careful to design a system containing at least one C2 axis of symmetry, a tactic
that made the hosts nonsided with respect to perching guests. A CDCl3 solution
of (R , R )-25 in CDCl3 at 0                was used to extract D 2 O solutions of racemic
amino acid or ester salts. As predicted in advance by CPK molecular models,
 the (D)-enantiomers were extracted preferentially into the organic layer. Chiral

 recognition factors ranged from a high of 31 for C 6H 5C H ( C O 2C H3) N H 3P F6 t o
a low of 2.3 with CH3C H ( C O 2H ) N H 3C 1 O 4. These factors represent free ener-
gy differences between diastereomeric complexes of 1.9 kcal mol -1 and 0.42
k c a l m o l- 1, respectively. Other amino acid and ester salt guests ranged be-
tween these values. We interpreted these results in terms of the complementa-
rity between host and guest of the (R,            configurations as visualized in the
complex 26, and the lack of complementarity in those of th e ( R , R ) - ( L ) -
configurations, which were designed not to form [38, 39].
   An amino acid and ester resolving machine was designed, built, and tested,
which is pictured in Figure 1. It made use of chiral recognition in transport of
amino acid or ester salts through lipophilic liquid membranes. From the
central reservoir of the W-tube containing an aqueous solution of racemic salt,
the (L)-enantiomer was picked up by (S,S)-25 in the left hand chloroform
reservoir and delivered to the left hand aqueous layer, while the (D)-enan-
tiomer was transported by (R,R)-25 in the right hand chloroform reservoir and
delivered to the right hand aqueous layer. The thermodynamic driving force for
the machine’s operation involved exchange of an energy-lowering entropy of
dilution of each enantiomer for an energy-lowering entropy of mixing. To
 maintain the concentration gradients down which the enantiomers traveled in

   In another experiment, we covalently attached the working part of (R,R)-25
at a remote position of the molecule to a macroreticular resin (polystyrene-
divinylbenzene) to give immobilized host of ~18,000 mass units per average

enantiomeric resolution of several amino acid salts. The behavior in the chro-
matographic resolution paralleled that observed in the extraction and transport
experiments, and was useful both analytically and preparatively. Separation
factors ranged from 26 to 1.4, the complexes of the (R,R)-(D)- or (S,S)-(L)-
configurations always being the more stable. The structure envisioned for the
more stable complex is formulated in 27 [41].

Partial Transacylase Mimics
The design and synthesis of enzyme-mimicking host compounds remains one of
the most challenging and stimulating problems of organic chemistry. We chose
to examine transacylase mimics first because the mechanism of action of these
enzymes had been so thoroughly studied.
   The active site of chymotrypsin combines a binding site, a nucleophilic
hydroxyl, an imidazole, and a carboxyl group in an array preorganized largely
by hydrogen bonds as indicated in 28. With the help of molecular models, we
designed 29 as an “ultimate target” host possessing roughly the same organiza-
tion of groups as that of 28.
   Compound 29 is much too complicated to synthesize without getting encour-
agement from simpler model compounds. An incremental approach to 29 was
employed. We first prepared 30, and found that it binds                          in CDCI 3

3 3 w e r e m e a s u r e d i n C H C l3 , and found to be first order in added Et 3 N /
E t3 N H C 1 O 4 buffer ratio. Thus the alkoxidc ion is the nucleophile. The rate
constant for acylation of 31 by 32 was calculated to be ~10 11 higher valued
than the rate constant for the noncomplexed model compound, 3-phenylbenzyl
alcohol [44]. This high factor demonstrates that collecting and orienting reac-
tants through highly structured complcxation can result in an enormous rate
acceleration. When NaClO 4 was added to the medium, the acylation rate of 31
was depressed by several powers of ten. Thus the acylation of 31, like that of
the serinc csterases, is subject to competitive inhibition.

   A thirty-step synthesis of 34 was then devised, and about 0.5 g of the
compound prepared [45]. This compound combines the binding site, the
nucleophilic hydroxyl, and the imidazole proton-transfer agent in the same
molecule, lacking only the carboxyl group of final target compound 29. Com-
pound 34 complexed CH 3 N H3 Pic and NaPic with respective              values of
 11.4 and 13.6 kcal mol - 1 in CDCl3 saturated with D2 O at 25° C. In pyridine-
chloroform, amino ester salt 32 instantaneously acylated the imidazole group
of 34 to give 35, which more slowly gave 36. In CHCl 3 in the absence of any
added base, the observed rate constant for acylation of 34 by 32 was higher by
a factor of 105 than that for acylation of an equal molar mixture of noncomplex-
ing model compounds 39 or 40 under the same conditions. The same ratio was
obtained when 37 was substituted for 34. Thus the imidazole groups of 34 and
37 are the sites of acylation. Introduction of NaClO 4 into the medium as a
competitive inhibitor of complexation destroyed much of the rate acceleration.
When 32 added to 38 was substituted for 34, the resulting complex acylated
imidazole 40 with a 10 rate-constant factor increase. Thus complexed 32 is a
better acylating agent than 32 alone.
   The disadvantages of comparing rate constants for reactions with different
molecularities are avoided by referring to uncomplexed 34 or 37, noncomplex-
ing imidazole 40, and uncomplexed acylating agent 32 as standard starting
states, and the rate-limiting transition states for transacylation as standard
final states. This treatment introduces K a into the second order rate constant
expression when complexation precedes acylation. The resulting second order
rate constants for 32 acylating 34 or 37 are higher by factors of 10 10 or 10 1 1
than the second order rate constant for 32 acylating 40. This work clearly


432                                  Chemistry 1987


demonstrates that complexation of the transition states for transacylation can
greatly stabilize those transition states to produce large rate factor increases
over comparable noncomplexed transition states [46]. Others have shown that
the imidazole of chymotrypsin is acylated first by esters of nonspecific sub-
strates [47].
   These investigations demonstrate that totally synthetic systems can be de-
signed and prepared which mimic the following properties of enzymes: the
ability to use complexation to vastly enhance reaction rates and the sensitivity
to competitive inhibition. In a different, chiral system, we demonstrated that a
synthetic host was capable of distinguishing between enantiomeric reactants
[48, 49]. We anticipate that as the field matures, many of the other remarkable
properties of enzyme systems will be observed in designed, synthetic systems.
Our results illustrate some of the strategies and methods that might be applied
in this expanding field of research.

Cavitands-Synthetic Molecular Vessels
Although enforced cavities of molecular dimensions are frequently encountered
in enzyme systems, RNA, or DNA, they are almost unknown among the seven
million synthetic organic compounds. In biological chemistry such cavities
play the important role of providing concave surfaces to which are attached
convergent functional groups which bind substrates and catalyze their reac-
tions. If synthetic biomimetic systems are to be designed and investigated,
simple means must be found of synthesizing compounds containing enforced
concave surfaces of dimensions large enough to embrace simple molecules or
ions. We applied the name cavitand to this class of compound [50].
   Cavitands designed and studied include compounds 42-45, many of which
were prepared from 41. The structure and conformational mobility of 41 had
been established by A. G. S. Högberg [51]. Th e substance is prepared in good
yield by treatment of resorcinol with acetaldehyde and acid. We rigiditied 41
and its derivatives by closing four additional rings to produce 42-45 [50, 52].
    As anticipated by molecular model examinations, 42-45 crystallize only as
solvates because these rigid molecules taken alone are incapable of filling their
voids either intermolecularly or intramolecularly. They are shaped like bowls
of differing depth supported on four methyl “feet.” Compound 42 forms
crystallates with SO 2 , CH 3 C N , and CH 2C l2, molecules to which it is comple-
mentary (molecular model examination). Cavitand 43, whose cavity is deeper,
c r y s t a l l i z e s w i t h a m o l e o f C H C l3 . Crystal structures of    and
                     show they are caviplexes, as predicted [53]. Cavitand 44 is vase-
shaped. It crystallizes with one mole of (CH 3 ) 2 NCHO, which is just small
enough to fit into the interior of 44 in models. Although the amide cannot be
removed at high temperature and low pressure, it is easily displaced with
C H C l3, one and one-half moles of which appear to take the place of the (CH 3)
2 NCHO          in the crystallate [50].
    Treatment of octal 41 with R2SiC1 2 gave a series of cavitands, of which 45 is
typical. In molecular models, 45 has a well-shaped cavity, defined by the
bottoms of four aryls and by four inward-turned methyl groups. In molecular

models, this well is complementary to small, cylindrical molecules such as
S = C = S , C H3 C=CH, and O=O, but not to larger compounds such as CDCls
o r C6 D 6 . Cavitand 45 and its analogues when dissolved in CDCls or C 6 D 6
complex guests such as those mentioned above, whose external surfaces are
complementary to the internal surface of the host cavity. Association constants
were determined for 45 and its analogues binding S=C=S. Values of -          as
high as 2 kcal mol - 1 have been observed. A crystal structure of        shows
that CS 2 occupies the well in the expected manner. Compound 45 in CDCls
was also shown to bind dioxygen reversibly [52]. Dissolution of 45 in solvents
such as CDCls or C6D 6 is the equivalent of dissolving “holes” in a medium into


434                                Chemistry 1987


which appropriately shaped solutes fall. The discrimination shown by the holes
for the guests exemplifies the principle of complementarity as applied to
cavitand complexation.
   The next steps in research on these cavitands is to append to them water-
solubilizing and catalytic groups. The former will provide them with hydropho-
bic driving forces to complex nonpolar guests, and the latter to catalyze
reactions of such guests.

Carcerands-Synthetic Molecular Cells
Absent among the millions of organic compounds hitherto reported are closed-
surface hosts with enforced interiors large enough to imprison behind covalent
bars, guests the size of ordinary solvent molecules. After much thought and
molecular model examination, we chose 48 as the target for synthesis of the
first molecular cell. The term carcerand was applied to this class of compound.
The synthesis involved treating C s2 C O3 with a solution in (CH 3 ) 2 N C H O -
( C H2) 4O of equal molar amounts of cavitands 46 and 47 under an atmosphere
of argon. The first question to be answered was: what guest compounds would
be trapped inside during the shell closure ? This question is akin to asking
whether two soup bowls closed rim-to-rim under the surface of a kettle of stew
would net any stew. The answer was that 48 “contained” essentially every kind
of component of the medium present during ring closure [54].
   The product (48 and guests) was very insoluble in all media, and was
purified by extracting it with the most powerful solvents of each type. The
remaining material was subjected to elemental analysis for C, H, S, O, N, Cl,
and Cs. Nitrogen analysis and an IR spectrum of the substance revealed that
( C H 3) 2NCHO had been entrapped. The presence of equivalent amounts of Cs
and Cl demonstrated that one or the other ion or both had to be encapsulated
in the host.
