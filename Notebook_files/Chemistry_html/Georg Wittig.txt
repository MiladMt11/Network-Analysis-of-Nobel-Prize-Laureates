Chemical research and mountaineering have much in common. If the goal or
the summit is to be reached, both initiative and determination as well as
perseverance are required. But after the hard work it is a great joy to be at the
goal or the peak with its splendid panorama. However, especially in chemical
research - as far as new territory is concerned - the results may sometimes
be quite different: they may be disappointing or delightful. Looking back at my
work in scientific research, I will confine this talk to the positive results (1).
   Some 50 years ago I was fascinated by an idea which I investigated experi-
mentally. The question was how ring strain acts on a ring if an accumulation of
phenyl groups at two neighboring carbon atoms weakens the C-C linkage and
predisposes to the formation of a diradical (for brevity called diyl) (Fig. 1).
Among the many experimental results (2) I choose the synthesis of the
hydrocarbons 1 and 4 (3), which we thought capable of diyl formation. Starting
materials were appropriate dicarboxylic esters, which we transformed into the
corresponding glycols. While these were obtained under the influence of
phenylmagnesium halide only in modest yield, phenyllithium proved to be
superior and was readily accessible by the method of K. Ziegler, using
bromobenzene and lithium. The glycolates resulting from the reaction with
potassium phenylisopropylide formed - on heating with methyl iodide - the
corresponding dimethyl ethers, which supplied the equivalent hydrocarbons 1
and 4 by alkali metal splitting and demetalation with tetramethylethylene
dibromide.

tetraphenyldihydrophenanthrene (4), which was prepared analogously, proved
to be a stable hydrocarbon, even when substituents R were introduced that
forced the biphenyl system to twist. While 4 did not decompose at 340°C and
was stable in solution against oxygen, its aryl-weakened C-C bond could be
observed since it split with potassium into the ring-opened dipotassium
derivate. The results of these investigations on formation of radicals and ring
strain seem to indicate that ring closure is more likely to contribute to
stabilization of the ethane bond.

   This stabilizing influence is documented impressively by the behavior of
tris(biphenylene)ethane (7), which was also synthesized (4) (Fig. 3). The
carbinol6, which was formed by the reaction of the ketone 5 with o-lithiobiphenyl,
transformed into the desired hydrocarbon 7 by an acid-catalyzed twofold
Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement.

   This first aromatic propellane, which melted at                  decomposition
and whose structure agreed with the nuclear magnetic resonance spectrum,
proved to be insensitive to ethane linkage-breaking sodium-potassium alloy.
Evidently the close aryl packing prevents penetration of the metal into the
interior of the molecule.
   Since the tendency to form diradicals was not evident with the hydrocarbons
mentioned, we intended to replace the phenyl groups by anisyls. Therefore,
suitable dicarboxylic esters should be brought into reaction with p-lithioanisole
(5). But, as we obtained unexpected smears, the functionally simple
benzophenone was used to treat the mixture that resulted from the reaction of
p-bromoanisolewith lithium. Instead of the expected p-anisyldiphenylcarbinol,
the bromine-containing compound 9 was isolated, whose structure could be
proved by conversion into the well-characterized derivative by zinc dust
distillation. Accordingly, p-lithioanisole, which was originally formed, metalates
the p-bromoanisole that is still present into compound 8 which then reacts with
benzophenone to form the isolated compound 9 (Fig. 4).

   When it was noted that phenyllithium too can modify pbromoanisole to
form 9, we decided to look closer at the lability of the aromatic proton as a
function of the substituent. In the course of these studies we arrived at the
surprising result that aryl iodide, bromide, and even chloride can exchange
with the electropositive metal of phenyllithium (6). Later we called this
principle ofreaction umpolung, or reversal of polarity (7) (Fig. 5). Simultaneously
and independently, H. Gilman found the same behavior when treating aryl
halides with butyllithium.

   Among the halogens of the various aromatic systems, fluorine proved to be
not exchangeable with lithium (8). Here we found an unexpected reaction
path. First we observed that in the formation of biphenyl by the reaction of
monohalobenzene with phenyllithium, fluorobenzene acted rapidly, forming
approximately 75 percent biphenyl, while the other halobenzenes produced
only 5 to 7 percent. We interpreted this result as indicating that biphenyl
formation was preceded by metalation of the halobenzene, which was stimulated
by the inductive effect of the strongly electronegative fluorine. This explanation
was supported by the finding that not biphenyl but o-lithiobiphenyl had been
produced. In 1942 we further assumed that an elimination of metal and
halogen results that leads to the occurrence of dehydrobenzene (9), and this
is what changes phenyllithium into the o-lithiobiphenyl found experimentally
(Fig. 6). Independent of our work, a proof for the intermediate occurrence
of dehydrobenzene was given by Roberts et al. (10), who reacted
[ 1-14C] chlorobenzene with potassium amide in liquid ammonia and isolated
the two expected anilines with approximately 50 percent yield (Fig. 7).

   Later we could prove the existence of the dehydrobenzene by expecting that
it would react as dienophile (11). For the diene and solvent we chose furan,
which, being an ether, should favor organometallic exchange while
simultaneously serving as a trapping agent. In an exciting experiment we had
                        react with lithium amalgam in furan and isolated with
good yield the endo-oxide 10, which had been formed by a Diels-Alder addition
(Fig. 8).

   We found the lifetime of dehydrobenzene in the gas phase (12) by the
thermal decomposition of bis (o -iodophenyl) mercury as well as phthaloyl
peroxide to biphenylene at 600°C in an argon atmosphere at reduced pressure.
When furan was injected behind the decomposition zone naphthol was
evolved as a by-product from the dihydronaphthalene endoxide that
occurred first. Under the conditions used, the lifetime of dehydrobenzene
was determined to be 20 milliseconds. See Fig. 9.

   Phenyllithium, which had opened so many areas by acting as a sort of
dowsing rod, was applied many times in the course of our research. Now our
attention was drawn to the proton-labile substrates, to the aliphatic as well as
the aromatic ones.
   The process of proton-metal cation exchange appeared to us to be of
fundamental importance, since the electron density at the carbon atom is
enhanced after metalation. Thus the question arose of how carbanions, with
their negative charge, would behave compared to carbonium ions, with their
positively charged carbon atoms.


                                       G. Wittig                             373


   At the time we were not sure whether hydrogen bound to carbon would
be proton-labile in quaternary ammonium salts. We came to this conclusion
with an absurd experiment to prepare pentamethylnitrogen from
tetramethylammonium salts by using the reaction of tetramethylammonium
halide with methyllithium (13).
   It was confirmed experimentally that the octet principle is strictly valid for
the elements of the first eight-element period. The object of synthesizing
compounds with a pentacoordinate central atom was reached only when we
studied the higher elements of the fifth main group - that is, phosphorus,
arsenic, antimony, and bismuth. It was easy to synthesize their pentaphenyl
derivatives (14) and, in the case of antimony, also pentamethylantimony, which
(as a nonpolar compound) is a liquid with a boiling point of 126°C (15).
   Tetramethylammonium chloride reacting with methyl- or phenyllithium
loses one proton and forms a product that we called trimethylammonium
methylide (II) (Fig. 10). We gave the name N-ylides to this new class of
substances since the bonding of the carbon to the neighboring nitrogen is
homopolar (yl) and ionic (ide) at the same time. Trimethylammonium
fluorenylide (12) could be isolated salt-free, thus its ylide structure is
unambiguous (16). Subsequently, ylides as well as cryptoylides were studied
more thoroughly (17).

   When we extended this concept to the phosphonium salts, we found that
they could be converted into the corresponding P-ylides even more readily
than the analogous ammonium salts when treated with organolithium
compounds (Fig. 11). The reason for the greater proton mobility is that
phosphorus, unlike nitrogen, can expand its outer electron shell to a decet.
This allows an energy-lowering resonance stability between the ylide and ylene
forms.

   In the case of the N-ylide the semipolar nature of the N-C bond is
demonstrated by its ability to add to benzophenone, forming the well-defined
betaine (18) (Fig. 12). Now, if the same reaction was performed with
triphenylphosphinemethylene, the expected betaine adductwas not obtained
but, astonishingly, triphenylphosphine oxide and l,l-diphenylethylene (19).
Evidently the initially produced betaine 13 - due to the ability of the central
atom to expand its electron shell -formed the four-membered ring 14, which
then decayed into two fragments as final products (20) and could not be
isolated by itself (Fig. 13).

    That the first step of the reaction is betaine formation was shown with the
reaction of triphenylphosphinemethylene and benzaldehyde. In this case the
betaine could be isolated as an intermediate product, and it decayed to
triphenylphosphine oxide and styrene only on heating (20). This type of
reaction (21) seemed to be of fundamental importance for preparative
chemistry, and it also found industrial application (22). By these means it was
possible to prepare vitamin A and                    among others. In the present
context I restrict the discussion to the synthesis ofvitamin A, which is produced
industrially at BASF under the direction of Pommer (22). The phosphonium
salt 16, obtainable from vinyl-β-ionol 15, triphenylphosphine, and acid, changes
with HX splitting into the corresponding phosphinemethylene derivative,
which reacts with                           17 to produce vitamin A in the form of
its acetate 18 (Fig. 14).

   With the addition of phenylsodium to triphenylboron, it could be
demonstrated that boron can also act as tetracoordinate central atom (Fig. 15).
Today this complex serves as an analytic reagent for the determination of
potassium, rubidium, and cesium ions as well as for the quantitative
determination and separation of ammonium and alkaloid salts.




  We called the complex salts with negatively charged central atom “ate”
complexes for understandable reasons (23). They can be compared with the
“onium” complexes, which were already known, as shown in Fig. 16. Because

of the inductive effect of the central atom in onium complexes, all ligands R
are cationically labilized and the hydrogen atoms at the neighboring carbon
atoms are proton-mobile; however, in ate complexes all ligands at the central
atom are anionically labilized and the hydrogen atoms at the neighboring
carbon atoms are hydride-labile. This rule explains numerous reactions. I do
not have time here to discuss its importance as a heuristic principle.
   Thus I come to the end of my lecture. The excursion from diyls to ylides now
ends at my idyll. With this I mean the conclusion of my research work as an
emeritus, which allowed me to continue my work as a chemist free from the
obligations of a teacher, and finally to devote myself completely to my interest
in fine arts. I want to close my talk by offering cordial thanks to my collaborators.
Without them my work could not have been accomplished.
