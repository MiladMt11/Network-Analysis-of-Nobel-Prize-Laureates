At no time in my life did I dream of such a Prize. Indeed, as I explained in my
biography, I had no training in research as such and as a consequence I am in
a sense self-taught. What I owe to the Institut Français du Pétrole is some free-
dom to choose my research area. I have always been an avid reader of chem-
ical literature, eager for what is new. Like all sciences, chemistry is marked by
magic moments. For someone fortunate enough to live such a moment, it is
an instant of intense emotion: an immense field of investigation suddenly
opens up before you. There were very many of these moments in the course
of my career. For example, the discovery of ferrocene, the stereospecific poly-
merization of olefins by G. Natta (I never failed to read any of his articles!),
the homogeneous catalysis of hydrogenation by rhodium complexes (G.
Wilkinson), the homogeneous catalysis of dimerization of olefins by nickel
complexes (G. Wilke and B. Bogdanovic) and the catalysis of asymmetric hy-
drogenation. I experienced the latter with an especially keen intensity be-
cause we were in very close touch with Henri Kagan, who came every month
to tell us about his chemistry; it was outstanding! And 1964 was an especially
magical year (Figure 1): a revelation for me, by R.L. Banks of Phillips Petrole-
um, of the disproportionation of olefins catalyzed by a molybdenum- or tung-
sten-based heterogeneous catalyst deposited on alumina, the homogeneous
catalysis of polymerization of cyclopentene by ring opening, published by
G. Natta, the existence of a new metal-carbon bond, the carbenes of E.O.
Fischer. A priori these three had nothing in common.
   The disproportionation of linear olefins, since called metathesis, is a equili-
brated reaction, governed basically by entropy. This is doubtless why, from the
start, “pairwise mechanisms” was favored (Figure 2), which assume a perfect sym-
metry of the reaction intermediates. In addition, these intermediates are based
on the only bonds known at the time: ␲ bonds and ␴ bonds between hydrocar-
bons and transition metals. Other mechanisms were proposed (Figure 3).
   The polymerization of cyclopentene into polypentenylene, for its part, is

governed mainly by the enthalpy linked to the release of the ring strain when
the ring is cleaved, but entropy also plays a part there due to the multiple
conformation of the chain and, like the metathesis of acyclic olefins, it is
equilibrated. These factors are no longer the same in the case of the higher
cycles, as we shall see later. To explain the high molecular weights observed
from the start of the reaction, G. Natta assumed the existence of a ␴ bond be-
tween the transition metal and the growing chain, the proposed mechanism
being an ␣-cleavage of the ring such as is often invoked in classic organic
chemistry.

   My immediate reaction back in 1964 was the thought that disproportiona-
tion and ring opening were part of the same reaction. In addition to the fact
that both reactions preserved the number and type of double bonds (only the
molecular weight of the products was changed), they used the same transition
metals, molybdenum and tungsten. In fact, at the time, in a way that may be
surprising today, there was a gap – a total lack of understanding – between
homogeneous catalysis and heterogeneous catalysis (some people even at-
tributed the fundamental role in the transformation to the catalyst support!).
Since I was familiar with both types of catalysis in our Institut, that was not a
real problem for me. But how could the statistical aspect of the one be recon-
ciled with the chain growth of the other? Meanwhile, N. Calderon had also
started building a bridge between homogeneous catalysis and heterogeneous
catalysis [1]. It then seemed obvious to associate the two reactions, where the
enthalpy of ring opening would in a sense “freeze” the statistical reactivity of
the acyclic olefin [2]. Accordingly cyclopentene was associated with 2-pentene in
the molar ratio 1:1 with the homogeneous catalyst WOCl4 and SnBu4 or
AlEt2Cl. The result was as follows (Figure 4): in addition to the di-unsaturated
product of the expected coupling of cyclopentene with 2-pentene (5+5), there
were other products, also di-unsaturated (5+4) and (5+6), in the ratio 1:2:1 for
the condensations in carbon 9/10/11; then higher tri-unsaturated products
containing (5+5+5), (5+5+4), and (5+5+6) carbon atoms; and so on, in
decreasing quantities, thereby forming “triads”. This was, then, a “telomeriza-
tion” reaction in which the telogene is n-pentene and the taxogene is cyclopen-
tene. Since the participation of the 2-pentene in the telomerization reaction is
at each instant equal to its participation in the metathesis reaction, the telo-
merization products are as a consequence not derived from the metathesis

products. The reaction, like the metathesis and polymerization of cyclopen-
tene, is equilibrated. The general characters of the telomerization reaction
have been verified for many pairs of olefins, such as 2-pentene/cyclooctene,
2-hexene/cyclopentene, and 3-heptene/cyclopentene. ␣-olefins such as
propene and 1-pentene are, as in the case of metathesis, less reactive, but the
telomers form in ratios from 1:10:1 to 1:20:1. 1,5-cyclooctadiene (cod) and
1,5,9-cyclododecatriene (cdt) lead to telomers of the same type, but in this case
the successive “triads” are separated by 4 atoms of carbon and not by an
integral multiple of the number of carbon atoms forming the ring.
   This therefore means that alcoylidene “residues” are left on the transition
metal. The most obvious hypothesis is the formation of a metallocarbene se-
questering an olefin to form a metallocyclobutane intermediate (Figure 5).

even at the very start of the reaction, so that it cannot be explained as a back-
biting reaction (reaction of the metallocarbene with one of the double bonds
of the growing chain), remains to be explained.
   While the cyclopentene is in equilibrium with its polymer (polypenteny-
lene), this is not true of the higher cycles such as cyclooctene and cycloocta-
diene: their polymers are in equilibrium with the cyclooligomers [3]. This is
due to the relative stability of the cycles, as P. J. Flory has shown in the case of
the lactones (Figure 6) [4]. These macrocycles are formed by back-biting.
   All three reactions can be represented as shown in Figure 7.
   It remains to be shown how the initial metallocarbene forms when a tung-

sten halide and an organometallic of the principal series are mixed. For this
we chose methylated derivatives that cannot give rise to ␤-H elimination,
methyllithium and tetramethyltin. All that could be hoped for was to favor ␣-
H elimination with the formation of a methylidene species that could simply
be “trapped” by means of olefins with a di-substituted double bond: 2-butene,
2-pentene, 3-hexene. Here is what can be observed (Figure 8) [5]. The forma-
tion of propene and of 1-butene clearly demonstrates the existence on the
tungsten of a methylidene group. The formation of methane is explained by
an ␣-H elimination, doubtless followed by a reducing elimination resulting
from a double alkylation of the tungsten.
   E.O. Fischer’s carbene is itself a very active catalyst for the polymerization
of cyclopentene in the presence of TiCl4 activated, probably photochemical-
ly, by chlorination of the tungsten (it is well known that TiCl4 is photochemi-
cally reduced by alkanes) [6].
   It is also possible to characterize and count the metallocarbenes formed on
rhenium peroxide impregnated on alumina, by means of a 1,2-disubstituted
olefin, then a reaction with ethylene to lead to propene [7] by a sequence of
reactions that might be:

CONCLUDING REMARKS
Obviously, not everyone has the opportunity to witness the birth of a new
bond like the one discovered by E.O. Fischer, and the event is likely to be-
come increasingly rare! Nor that of a unified concept encompassing two
types of catalysis that until then had not been on speaking terms. It was an op-
portunity that had to be seized!


ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
I owe a great deal to everyone who took part in what I can rightly call an “ad-
venture”, because at the start we could not be sure of reaching a significant
result. And more particularly to the talented students directly involved –
Jean-Louis Hérisson, J.-P. Soufflet, and G. Zaborowski – without whom this
work (and therefore the Prize!) would not have existed.
