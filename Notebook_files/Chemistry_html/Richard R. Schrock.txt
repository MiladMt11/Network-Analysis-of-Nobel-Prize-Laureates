It’s my great priviledge to be here today, in a position I never thought pos-
sible. I hope the story that I will tell you will give you some idea what I have
contributed to the area for which the Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded
this year.
   The story begins thirty two years ago in 1973, the year the Nobel Prize was
shared by G. Wilkinson and E. O. Fischer. Wilkinson’s Nobel Lecture1 con-
cerned the nature of a single bond between a transition metal and a carbon
atom in an alkyl group, and emphasized the fact that the metal-carbon bond
is not inherently weak. E. O. Fischer in his Nobel Lecture2 summarized the
extensive chemistry of transition metal “carbene” complexes3,4 that contain a
metal-carbon double bond discovered by him and his group in 1964 (Fig 1).5
He also reported new “carbyne” complexes that contain a metal-carbon triple
bond.6 It was clear that metal-carbon single bonds were of great importance
in the emerging area of homogeneous catalysis. However, no catalytic reac-
tions involving species that contain metal-carbon double or triple bonds were
known. When I went to the Central Research Department of E. I. DuPont de
Nemours and Company in 1972, transition metal organometallic chemistry
and homogeneous catalysis were of great interest as a consequence of their
huge potential in organic chemistry and therefore in industry.
   In the early 1970’s inorganic chemists knew that many transition metal
species containing a metal-carbon bond are subject to various modes of decom-
position that are much more rapid than in a non-transition metal species such
as Zn(CH2CH3)2 or Al(CH2CH3)3. The most common of these involves transfer
of a ␤ hydrogen, from an ethyl group (MCH2CH3) for example, to the metal to

yield a metal-hydride and an alkene. The relative stabilities of high oxidation
state “homoleptic” or “peralkyl” compounds such as M[CH2Si(CH3)3]4,
M(CH2C6H5)4, and M[CH2C(CH3)3]4 (M = Ti, Zr, or Hf; Fig 2), were rational-
ized on the basis of the fact that unlike a compound having an ethyl ligand, the
alkyl ligands in these species lack ␤ hydrogens and so of course cannot under-
go decomposition processes that involve ␤ hydrogens.7 In 1973 Wilkinson pub-
lished the synthesis of W(CH3)6.8 Unlike M(CH3)4 species (where M = Ti, Zr, or
Hf) W(CH3)6 is stable at 22°C. The methyl carbon is ␣ with respect to the
metal; there is no ␤ carbon and so no ␤ hydrogens. However, methyl species are
not sterically protected against bimolecular reactions that involve ␣ hydrogens. As
you can see from the note added in the proof of Wilkinson’s Nobel address,9 I
was intrigued by high oxidation state peralkyl complexes and had chosen to ex-
plore the organometallic chemistry of tantalum soon after my arrival at
DuPont. Little alkyl chemistry was known of the metals in group 5 (V, Nb, Ta)
at that time; I chose tantalum because it is next to tungsten in group 6 (Cr, Mo,
W), and like tungsten, tantalum is relatively stable in its highest possible oxida-
tion state, Ta(5+). Peralkyl tantalum complexes therefore must be pentaalkyls.
   My starting point for tantalum alkyl chemistry was a paper by G. L. Juvinall10
in which he described the low yield synthesis of niobium and tantalum
trimethyl dichloride species through addition of dimethylzinc to the metal
pentachlorides. I found that crystalline TaMe3Cl2 not only could be prepared
quantitatively in pentane on a large scale (Eq 1), but it could be stored for

lents of LiMe to generate volatile, yellow, crystalline TaMe5.11 This species is
much less stable than W(CH3)6, but much more stable than Hf(CH3)4.
Pentamethyltantalum decomposes above 0 °C to yield ~3.7 equivalents of
methane, and it does so in a bimolecular fashion. Pentamethyltantalum has 15
sterically unprotected ␣ C-H bonds and the metal is highly electron-deficient
(10 electrons, 8 shy of the preferred 18 electron count). Interactions between
one metal center and CH bonds in another metal complex thereby are en-
couraged, and are easier in TaMe5 than in WMe6 for simple steric reasons.

Wilkinson had just published a reaction that yielded an unusual dimeric
species containing what he called “carbene bridge,” ␮-CSiMe3 (actually a car-
byne bridge; Eq 2). With respect to Ta(CH2SiMe3)5 he said “It is assumed that
a penta-alkyl complex cannot exist for steric reasons.”12 Therefore, I turned to
experiments involving the neopentyl (CH2CMe3) ligand in order to probe the
limit of steric crowding in homoleptic d0 tantalum pentaalkyls and the nature
of the decomposition pathways that might be observable in such circum-
stances. The crucial experiment (Eq 3) consisted of an attempt to prepare

mally stable (Me3CCH2)3Ta=CHCMe3 was formed in quantitative yield.13 The
exact mechanism is still not known, but it is likely that an ␣ hydrogen is activat-
ed by the metal and subsequently removed as a proton by a neopentyl group,
possibly in an intramolecular manner in pentaneopentyltantalum itself (Eq 4).

(Me3SiCH2)3Ta=CHSiMe3 may be an intermediate in the reaction shown in
equation 2, but it must decompose intermolecularly to give tetramethylsilane
and the observed dimeric species; (Me3CCH2)3Ta=CHCMe3 does not.
   The tantalum neopentylidene complex, (Me3CCH2)3Ta=CHCMe3, was new
in several respects. It was the first example of a stable transition metal M=CHR
species. Second, the terminal alkylidene was formed through a new type of re-
action, an intramolecular ␣ hydrogen abstraction from an alkyl. Third, unlike
“carbene” complexes discovered by Fischer and his group,
(Me3CCH2)3Ta=CHCMe3 was highly electron-deficient (10 electrons in metal-
based bonding orbitals). Fourth, (Me3CCH2)3Ta=CHCMe3 appeared to be-

bond being polarized so that the metal is relatively positive and the carbon re-
latively negative, opposite to what is found in Fischer-type carbene complexes.
Fifth, the high thermal stability and resistance of (Me3CCH2)3Ta=CHCMe3 to-
ward intermolecular decomposition reactions, as well as toward further in-
tramolecular reactions, suggested that other high oxidation state, four-coordi-
nate species that contain four sterically demanding covalently bound ligands
might be viable. This simple but important principle pervaded much of the
high oxidation state chemistry that was developed over the next 30 years in my
group.
   “Deprotonation” of a neopentyl ligand to give a neopentylidene ligand sug-
gested that a neopentylidene ligand might be deprotonated further by an ex-
ternal base. Indeed, addition of n-butyllithium to (Me3CCH2)3Ta=CHCMe3
led to formation of the related high oxidation state, anionic, neopentylidyne
species, {(Me3CCH2)3Ta–––CCMe3}Li14 (Eq 5).

   Finally, it was demonstrated that even a methylene (Ta=CH2) species could
be prepared through deprotonation of [TaCp2(CH3)2]+.15,16 Even though
TaCp2(CH3)(CH2) contains 18 electrons in metal-based orbitals, it is unstable
toward bimolecular decomposition to yield an ethylene complex in 50%

battle that continues to be fought today. The main point is that between 1973
and 1975 high oxidation state tantalum-carbon double and triple bonds had
been prepared, and they appeared to be significantly different in several im-
portant respects from the low oxidation state species prepared by Fischer.
  At some point in the early 1970’s I became aware of the “olefin metathesis”
reaction (Eq 7), a startling and mysterious reaction catalyzed by homoge-
neous Mo and W catalysts (and heterogeneous Re catalysts), the identities of
which were not known.17-20 Physical organic experiments by (inter alia) R. H.

fashion, and Chauvin was the first to propose the correct “carbene/metalacy-
clobutane” mechanism (Eq 8) that would account for all observations.27
However, at that time no “carbene” complexes were known that would react
efficiently with ordinary olefins as proposed by Chauvin.
   Alkyne metathesis (Eq 9), both heterogeous28,29 and homogeneous,30 cata-
lyzed by Mo and W compounds of unknown type, also had been discovered.
T. J. Katz24 proposed a mechanism of alkyne metathesis analogous to that for
olefin metathesis (Eq 10), i.e., one that involves formation of metalacyclobuta-

alyze alkyne metathesis.
   I asked myself whether the new types of tantalum “alkylidene” and “alkyli-
dyne” complexes might not be at least the type of species that metathesize
olefins and acetylenes, respectively, even though tantalum was not known to
be a catalyst for either of these reactions at that time.
   After my move to MIT in 1975, I began to explore reactions between vari-
ous tantalum alkylidene complexes and olefins in some detail. It became
clear (Eq 11) that electron deficient tantalum and niobium alkylidenes would

no metathesis products therefore were observed.31 At an international sym-
posium on olefin metathesis (ISOM III) in 1979 in Lyon I reported that nio-
bium and tantalum complexes that contain t-butoxide ligands in place of chlo-
ride ligands, such as M(CH-t-Bu)(O-t-Bu)2Cl(PMe3), could be coaxed into
metathesizing olefins. Several dozen catalytic metathesis cycles could be ob-
served for an olefin such as cis-2-pentene.32 It was proposed that the t-but-
oxide ligands “prevent reduction” of the metal and “promote metathesis.” At
that same conference I reported that an attempt to carry out a “Wittig-like”
reaction between a tantalum alkylidene and a tungsten oxo complex to yield
W(CH-t-Bu)(O-t-Bu)4 and Ta(O)L2Cl3, instead produced an unanticipated 18

neopentylidene complex would react with olefins to yield metathesis prod-
ucts and new alkylidenes that one would expect from the metathesis reaction,
including a methylene complex, and especially rapidly in the presence of a
trace of AlCl3. This was a convincing demonstration that the oxo alkylidene
species react with olefins readily and reform an alkylidene complex of the
same type from half an olefin that was present. The role of AlCl3, it was pro-
posed, was to remove either chloride or phosphine (reversibly) and thereby
create an empty coordination site at the electronically saturated metal center.
   A four-coordinate neopentylidene species containing large, covalently
bound ligands was believed to be the most likely isolable, but reactive, electron
deficient species. A neopentylidene ligand clearly was required. We also knew
that alkoxides were desirable, but what should the fourth, and necessarily di-
anionic, ligand X (Fig 3) be? An oxo ligand was unsuitable because it almost
certainly would encourage bimolecular decomposition reactions. We focussed
on an imido ([NR]2-) ligand, an isoelectronic analog of an oxo ligand, since
the imido ligand could be sterically protected by a large R group. After consid-

ering the likely synthetic difficulties associated with R being a 2,6-di-t-
butylphenyl group, we settled on the 2,6-diisopropylphenyl group, a choice
that in part was in response to a comment by K. B. Sharpless concerning the
value of isopropyl groups in general versus t-butyl groups. (The 2,6-diisopropyl-
phenyl group is found in many nitrogen-based ligands in a large variety of cata-
lysts today.) Several large and sterically demanding tertiary alcohols and phe-
nols were available, including fluorinated t-butanols such as (CF3)2MeCOH
whose pKa in water (~9) is significantly less than that of t-butanol itself (~19).
We felt that the electron withdrawing ability of the hexafluoro-t-butoxide li-
gand should increase the electrophilicity of the metal dramatically and there-
fore also increase the rate of the reaction of an alkylidene complex with an
olefin. Therefore, we aimed to prepare W(NAr)(CHCMe3)[OCMe(CF3)2]2
(Fig 3) with the expectation that this 14 electron species not only could be iso-
lated, but that it would metathesize olefins readily.
   Being aware of the almost magical properties of the neopentyl ligand (as
well as neopentylidene and neopentylidyne ligands), we also were curious
about simple reactions between W(VI) compounds (initially WCl6) and
neopentyllithium or neopentylmagnesium chloride, and had begun exploring
such reactions in 1977. We discovered that a volatile, yellow, crystalline alkyli-
dyne complex could be isolated from such reactions,34 and that the reaction
between W(OMe)3Cl3 and six equivalents of Me3CCH2MgCl in diethyl ether
produced that species in a yield of ~50% (Eq 15).35 (Me3CCH2)3W–––CCMe3 is

closely related to (Me3CCH2)3Ta=CHCMe3 in having four neopentyl or
neopentyl-derived ligands around the metal. As we became aware of the bene-
fits of alkoxides for efficient olefin metathesis, we became curious whether a
trialkoxide species such as (Me3CO)3W–––CCMe3 could be prepared and
whether it would be an efficient alkyne metathesis initiator. We were pleased to
find that (Me3CO)3W–––CCMe3 in fact could be prepared readily (Eq 16), and
especially pleased to find that alkynes are metathesized at room temperature

with (Me3CO)3W–––CCMe3 as the initiator36 at rates thousands of times faster
than “black box” catalysts known in the literature. This finding proved to us
that sterically bulky alkoxides were indeed highly beneficial for metathesis ac-
tivity. In contrast to (Me3CO)3W–––CCMe3, (dme)Cl3W–––CCMe3 does not
metathesize alkynes, even though a tungstenacyclobutadiene intermediate
necessary for that transformation, e.g., Cl3W[C(t-Bu)C(CH3)C(CH3)], could
be isolated and crystallographically characterized!37 Other reactions took
precedence.38-40 (Me3CCH2)3W–––CCMe3 also did not metathesize internal
alkynes; it was simply too unreactive. When the OR group in (RO)3W–––CCMe3
was a more electron withdrawing alkoxide or phenoxide, we could isolate and
crystallographically characterize intermediate tungstenacyclobutadiene com-
plexes in alkyne metathesis reactions and study them in detail.41,42

react with internal alkynes to yield (Me3CO)3W–––CR complexes (Eq 17),
which is effectively a metathesis-like reaction? The answer turned out to be
yes, and it did so amazingly readily.45 Although this is not a general reaction
for all X3M–––MX3 species (M = Mo or W), the fact that it is facile only when X
is a relatively sterically bulky alkoxide, had to be more than a coincidence.
This discovery opened up a route to (Me3CO)3W–––CR species that did not
rely on ␣ hydrogen abstraction reactions,46 and cemented the relationship
between, and interconvertibility of, strong triple bonds between metals,
between carbons (in alkynes), and between a metal and a carbon in an alkyli-
dyne complex. It is interesting to note that the C–––N bond in nitriles is also
cleaved readily, although the N–––N bond in dinitrogen is not. That spectacular

   But tungsten alkylidynes were important for an additional reason. If a
neopentylidyne species could be prepared by removing an ␣ proton from a
neopentylidene ligand, could not that reaction be run in the reverse direc-
tion, i.e., could not a proton be added to a neopentylidyne species to yield a
neopentylidene species? Moreover, could that not be accomplished in a man-
ner that would produce the other desired metal-ligand multiple bond, name-
ly the imido ligand, at the same time? An amido/alkylidyne complex could in
fact be prepared readily and the proton then moved from N to C by a base
(Eq 18). A large variety of W(NAr)(CH-t-Bu)(OR)2 complexes then could be

prepared readily from the dichloride species, as long as OR was large enough
to prevent complications that resulted from bimolecular reactions. X-ray
structures such as that in Figure 4 showed how the t-butyl group of the
neopentylidene ligand points toward the imido ligand (a syn orientation),
and how the diisopropylphenyl group on nitrogen protects the imido nitro-
gen and the alkylidene carbon atom against bimolecular reactions.
   It soon became clear that W(NAr)(CH-t-Bu)(OR)2 species would metathe-
size olefins in the expected manner with an activity that correlated roughly
with the electron withdrawing power of the OR ligand. Catalysts that contain
hexafluoro-t-butoxide ligands appeared to have the highest activities. We
found that tungstenacyclobutane intermediates, the very intermediates pro-
posed by Chauvin in the metathesis reaction, actually could be isolated and
crystallographically characterized.48 However, tungstenacyclobutane stabilities
proved to be a problem is some circumstances; loss of an olefin from an un-

substituted tungstenacyclobutane intermediate, in particular, could be rela-
tively slow. The metal therefore would remain sequestered in the form of a
tungstenacyclobutane. Since Mo-ligand bonds are generally weaker than W-
ligand bonds, we felt that a molybdacyclobutane complex might lose an olefin
more readily. Therefore, we aimed to synthesize analogous Mo(NAr)(CH-t-
Bu)(OR)2 catalysts. A synthesis of bisalkoxides was devised, the key feature of
which is the use of an imido “protecting group” that is then removed upon ad-
dition of triflic acid (Eq 19), thereby forming in the process a neopentylidene
ligand from two neopentyl ligands through an ␣ hydrogen abstraction reac-
tion in a hypothetical Mo(NR’)(CH2-t-Bu)2(Triflate)2 intermediate.49 The imi-
do (NR’) and alkoxide groups could be varied widely and a large number of
molybdenum catalysts therefore became accessible.
   The molybdenum bisalkoxide catalysts are also remarkably active for a wide
range of metathesis reactions, again especially when the alkoxide is the high-
ly electron withdrawing OCMe(CF3)2 group, and molybdacyclobutane inter-
mediates are less stable than tungstacyclobutane intermediates toward loss of
olefin. The steric bulk of the OCMe(CF3)2 and Ar (2,6-diisopropylphenyl)
groups are also of considerable importance in preventing bimolecular reac-
tions between the intermediate Mo(NAr)(CHR’)(OR)2 species in any given
reaction. We slowly began to understand the extent to which the metathesis
reaction could be controlled through systematic variation of the size and the
electronic characteristics of the alkoxide and imido groups.
   We also discovered that two isomers of any M=CHR catalyst are possible
(Eq 20). In the isomer that is usually observed the alkylidene’s substituent

points toward the imido group (syn), while in the other it points away from
the imido group (anti). Syn and anti species can be formed during the course
of a metathesis reaction, but syn and anti isomers of any given alkylidene also
can interconvert simply through rotation about the Mo=C bond. The rate of
rotation of a neopentylidene or neophylidene was found to vary by a factor of
at least 106, and to depend (largely) on the nature of the alkoxide,50,51 with
rotation being relatively fast in the presence of alkoxide ligands such as t-but-
oxide and relatively slow in the presence of hexafluoro-t-butoxide ligands. In

ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP) studies, one of many varia-
tions of the basic olefin metathesis reaction, we proved (for one type of poly-
merizeable monomer) that the anti isomer was the more reactive by a factor
of ~104. Therefore one, or the other, or both syn and anti intermediates in a
catalytic reaction might be involved, with the outcome depending upon the
nature of the imido and alkoxide groups, and the reactivity of the olefin in-
volved in the reaction with syn and anti intermediates, and also the tempera-
ture and other variables. This circumstance complicates to a considerable de-
gree a detailed understanding of the metathesis reaction by such catalysts,
but at the same time dramatically increases the flexibility of the catalysts and
the possibility that a metathesis reaction will proceed efficiently.
   Ring-opening metathesis polymerization of cyclic olefins had been studied
for many years before well-defined catalysts were developed.17,18 We naturally
asked whether well-defined catalysts behaved as polymerization catalysts for
cyclic olefins, and if so, what advantages did they offer? In our only publica-
tion together, one that resulted from my sabbatical at Caltech as a Fairchild
scholar in 1986, Grubbs and I showed that these new well-defined catalysts did
behave in the expected manner, and that the process could be “living” in the
right circumstances, i.e., intermediate alkylidenes that contain the growing
polymer chain would not decompose.52 In my laboratory we went on to show
that the polymerization process could be controlled in a dramatic fashion to
yield polymers with a highly regular repeating structure. Generally polymers
with highly regular structures have the most interesting properties and there-
fore are the most desirable. In many cases we found that the entire polymer
structure can be controlled through minute, but critical, changes in the cata-
lyst structure. For example (Eq 21) a highly regular cis,isotactic polymer is

formed if the catalyst contains a specific binaphtholate ligand and a
dimethylphenylimido group (R = CH3 in the 2,6-disubstituted phenyl
group).53,54 In contrast, if the R group in the imido ligand is isopropyl, then the
polymer has a relatively random structure. The smaller dimethylphenylimido
group is believed to allow polymerization to proceed solely via syn isomers to
give cis linkages. Control of the “tacticity,” or the way the five-membered rings
point in this polymer, is greatest in the presence of a chiral (racemic) binaph-
tholate ligand, which is a consequence of “enantiomorphic site control” over
the polymerization process. In a series of experiments with related monomers
that contain two esters made from enantiomerically pure alcohols, we could
distinguish between isotactic and syndiotactic polymers, and therefore could

prove the cis,isotactic structure, which is formed through enantiomorphic site
control, and the trans,syndiotactic structure, which is formed through chain-
end control, for the first time in ROMP polymers.55 The degree to which one
can control the polymer structure through systematic, tiny variations of the
catalyst is of great importance for many ROMP polymers that are made today
with high oxidation state alkylidene catalyst initiators.
  For some time it had been known that “classical” Mo and W catalysts that
would metathesize olefins would also polymerize alkynes. This suggested that
metal alkylidenes were responsible.56-58 We showed that well-defined species
do indeed polymerize alkynes59 or cyclopolymerize 1,6-heptadiynes60 (Eq 22)

to yield polymers analogous to those described in the literature. In the case of
a cyclopolymerization of 1,6-heptadiynes such as diethyldipropargylmalonate,
a six-membered or a five-membered ring can form, depending upon the re-
giochemistry of the addition of the first alkyne to the alkylidene. Since the
optical properties of such polyenes vary with the polymer’s structure and
chain length,61 it is highly desirable to make a polymer with a single structure
and to control the molecular weight of that polymer through a polymeriza-
tion with a well-defined catalyst. Although work is still ongoing in this area, it
now appears possible to do so.62,63
   In 1992 G. C. Fu and R. H. Grubbs published two papers in which they
demonstrated how Mo(NAr)(CHCMe2Ph)[OCMe(CF3)2]2 could be em-
ployed to make cyclic olefins quickly and efficiently that contain functionali-
ties other than a C=C bond,64,65 with the only other product being a volatile
olefin such as ethylene, propylene, or butene (Fig 5). Rings of many sizes,
and even rings that contain tetrasubstituted olefinic bonds, could be pre-
pared. These papers helped awaken organic chemists to the possibility that
olefin metathesis by well-defined catalysts had significant potential in organ-
ic chemistry. The fact that the Mo and W catalysts in this general class are sen-

strated that relatively complex molecules could be prepared via metathesis.
These and other applications of metathesis technology, along with the com-
mercial availability of Mo(NAr)(CHCMe2Ph)[OCMe(CF3)2]2, helped fuel ap-
plications of Mo metathesis technology to organic chemistry.67 The possibili-
ty that metathesis could be employed routinely in organic chemistry I believe
was a significant factor that drove Grubbs to develop ruthenium catalysts in
the early 1990’s.20,68,69
   The use of alkyne metathesis catalysts for organic chemistry also was real-
ized in the 1990’s, primarily through work by A. Fürstner, who showed that
large rings could be prepared through alkyne metathesis with the
(Me3CO)3W–––CCMe3 initiator.70 A cyclic alkyne then could be hydrogenated
selectively to yield a cis olefin (Lindlar reduction). This alternative to alkene
metathesis circumvented a still unsolved problem, formation of largely
(~75%) thermodynamically more favored trans double bonds in alkene
metathesis, instead of cis double bonds. An example is the stereoselective syn-
thesis of civetone (Eq 24).71 Many other reactions that involve formation of a
carbon-carbon triple bond through alkyne metathesis as part of a synthetic
organic procedure began to appear, such as syntheses of the cytotoxic marine
alkaloid motuporamine C,72 prostaglandin E2-1,15-lactone,73 and epothilone

catalysts were known,76,77 work by Cummins,78 Fürstner,79 and Moore,80
recently have demonstrated how these relatively inaccessible Mo catalysts can
be prepared in situ from trisamidoalkylidyne precursors.
   With the knowledge that certain sterically protected biphenolates and bi-
naphtholates can be attached to Mo to yield stable neopentylidene or neo-
phylidene ROMP initiators, we turned to the development of enantiomerical-
ly pure catalysts for asymmetric metathesis reactions in the mid 1990’s. Some
preliminary results were obtained with an enantiomerically pure biphenolate
catalyst (Fig 7) in 1997. We then began a collaboration with A. H. Hoveyda

enantiomerically pure variations that contain one of several different imido

developed, among them ring-opening/ring-closing metathesis (Eq 28),84
ring-opening/cross metathesis (Eq 29),85 and the ring closing of tertiary
amines to yield products resembling substructures of various drugs and
other natural products (Eq 30).86 It also was shown that the synthesis of drugs
such as tipranavir, an HIV protease inhibitor, could be shortened dramatical-

lematic enantiomerically pure tertiary ether (Eq 31).87,88 These are but a few

   The isolation and testing of many catalyst variations side by side for one
specific asymmetric reaction revealed that the efficiency of the asymmetric
catalysts in terms of yield and enantioselectivity can vary dramatically, and
that in the long run one could be relatively confident of finding an efficient
catalyst. However, dozens of catalysts have to be prepared, isolated, and test-
ed. Therefore, we have begun to explore the possibility of preparing catalysts
in situ that we know exist as relatively stable species, either through addition
of the biphenolate or binaphtholate to the bistriflate precursor (Eq 19), or
through addition of the parent biphenol or binaphthol to a bisamido precur-
sor (Eq 32). We have shown that catalysts prepared in situ for asymmetric
metathesis reactions behave as well as catalysts that have been isolated and
purified.89 Surprisingly, similar approaches using dineopentyl species led to
formation of monoalkoxide species (Eq 33).90 Initially we thought these would
be relatively poor metathesis catalysts, since dineopentyl species are essential-
ly inactive for metathesis. The presence of one neopentyl and one alkoxide
instead of two alkoxides therefore should be detrimental. However, prelimi-
nary results suggest that monoalkoxides are highly active catalysts. Recent
theoretical calculations in related isoelectronic rhenium systems have sug-
gested why this might be the case.91 Formation of only monoalkoxides from
dineopentyl species recently has allowed the synthesis of “well-defined” and
highly active molybdenum-based (and tungsten-based) metathesis catalysts
on silica surfaces (Eq 34) that are relatively long-lived because intermediate
alkylidenes cannot decompose bimolecularly.92 A variety of relatively well-de-
fined catalysts now can be prepared on silica surfaces using other Ta(V),
Mo(VI), W(VI), and Re(VII) neopentyl precursors (Fig 9).93 In some cases
entirely new reactions can be observed such as “alkane metathesis” by tanta-
lum catalysts.94 This reaction has now been shown to involve alkene metathesis
steps.95
   Rhenium forms metathesis catalysts of the “classical” type. Therefore we

felt that we should be able to prepare well-defined catalysts. In order to main-
tain the four-coordinate geometry around a neutral Re center, a sterically de-
manding ligand that is triply bound to the metal is required. The only logical
choice is a neopentylidyne ligand. In fact, well-defined Re(VII) bisalkoxide
catalysts for alkene metathesis can be prepared following the principles
learned in W and Mo chemistry,96,97 since the neopentylidyne ligand does not
react with olefins readily (Fig 10). Monoalkoxide mononeopentyl analogs are
believed to be even more reactive than bisalkoxides, especially on silica sur-
faces.91
   Finally, we have found that M=M double bonds can form where M = Mo,98
W,99 or Re100 as a consequence of decomposition of alkylidene species (Eq
35). Metal-metal double bonds are unusual, especially when the double bond

is not bridged by potentially bridging ligands such as an alkoxide or an imi-
do. The fact that these species themselves will metathesize certain olefins98
(slowly) raises the possibility that alkylidenes are being reformed from M=M
bonds. If this turns out to be the case, it would constitute strong evidence that
interconversion of metal-metal, carbon-carbon, and metal-carbon bonds is
possible for double bonds, as we know it to be for triple bonds (Eq 17).
   We have come an enormous distance in the last 30 years, from “ill-defined”
metathesis catalysts to those whose structure and reactivity in solution (and
perhaps now on surfaces) we can control with pinpoint precision.
Fundamental problems with known catalysts remain, the most important be-
ing how to prevent catalyst decomposition and/or how to regenerate catalysts
from “clean” decomposition products. I expect these challenges to be met
and hope that the consequences of the synthesis and fundamental study of

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
I am grateful for the freedom given to me in early years at the Central
Research Department at duPont, for the opportunity to broaden my efforts
and my interests at MIT, and for the support provided by various funding
agencies (the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health,
the Navy, the Army, and the Department of Energy) over the years for high
oxidation state organometallic chemistry and other projects. I am forever in-
debted to my graduate and postdoctoral students, each of whom in his or her
own way has contributed to the massive effort required to turn a few observa-
tions and new compounds into chemistry that has had a significant impact on
fields outside of inorganic chemistry. Finally, I want to thank my wife Nancy
and my family for their love and support.
