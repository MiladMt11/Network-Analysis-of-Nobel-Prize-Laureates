Introduction
The transfer of genetic information from nucleic acid to protein inside cells
can be represented as shown in Fig. 1. This simple scheme reflects accurate-
ly the fact that the information contained in the linear arrangement of the
subunits of DNA is copied accurately into the linear arrangement of subun-
its of RNA which, in turn, is translated by machinery inside the cell into
proteins, the macromolecules responsible for governing many of the impor-
tant biochemical processes in vivo. The function of the straightforward
transfer of information is carried out by a class of molecules called messen-
ger RNAs (mRNAs). The diagram shown does not elaborate on the proper-
ties of other RNA molecules that are transcribed from DNA, namely
transfer RNA (tRNA) and ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and many other minor
species of RNA found in vivo that had no identifiable function prior to
1976, nor does it indicate that the information in DNA and RNA can be
replicated as daughter DNA and RNA molecules, respectively (see Crick,
1970, for further discussion).
   Ribosomes are complexes, which in Escherichia coli, are made of about 50
proteins and three RNA molecules. It is on these particles that mRNA
directs the synthesis of protein from free amino acids. tRNA molecules (Fig.
2) perform an adaptor function in the sense that they match particular
amino acids to a group of three specific nucleotides in the mRNA to be
translated and ensure that the growing polypeptide (protein) chain contains
the right linear sequence of amino acid subunits. Thus, rRNA and tRNA
participate in the process of information transfer inside cells but they
clearly do so in a comparatively complex manner. mRNA, understandably,

has a very short half-life inside cells but rRNA and tRNA are relatively stable
molecules since they are part of the translational machinery that must be
used over and over.
   My work on RNA began as a study of certain mutants that disrupted the
ability of tRNA molecules to function normally during translation (Altman,
 1971). This research, in turn, led to the identification of another stable
 RNA molecule that had, unexpectedly, all the properties of an enzyme
 (Guerrier-Takada et al., 1983). Aside from its intrinsic interests to students
of catalysis and enzymology, our finding of enzymatic activity associated
with RNA has stimulated reconsideration of the role of RNA in biochemical
systems today (see Cech, 1987, and Altman, 1989, for reviews) as illustrated
in Fig. 1, and of the nature of complex biochemical systems eons ago
 (Darnell and Doolittle, 1986; Westheimer, 1986; Weiner and Maizels, 1987;
Joyce, 1989).
   As was first pointed out over twenty years ago by Woese (1967), Crick
(1968) and Orgel (1968), if RNA can act as a catalyst the origin of the
genetic code plays a much less critical role in the early stages of evolution of
the first biochemical systems that were capable of replicating themselves.
Indeed, the variety of biochemical reactions now known to be governed by
RNA, as outlined in Table 1 (Altman, 1989), allows one to consider the

possibility that a large number of diverse enzymatic reactions took place in
the absence of protein. To add further substance to these ideas about life on
earth over a billion years ago, it is important to understand exactly how
catalytic RNA, as we know it, works and what role it plays in vivo today. This
discussion deals primarily with the catalytic RNA subunit of the enzyme
ribonuclease P from Escherichia coli.


A BRIEF ACCOUNT OF STUDIES OF RIBONUCLEASE P
Finding the substrate
In October, 1969 I arrived at the MRC laboratory of Molecular Biology in
Cambridge, England ostensibly to study the three-dimensional structure of
tRNA through the use of physical-chemical methods. On my arrival, Sydney
Brenner and Francis Crick informed me that the crystal structure of yeast
tRNA Phe had recently been solved (Rim et al., 1974; Robertus et al., 1974)
and that there was no further need to engage in the studies originally
outlined for me. I was further instructed to get settled, to think about a new
problem for a week or two, and then to return for another discussion.
Although some of my colleagues remember me as being upset by that
conversation with Brenner and Crick, the feeling must have passed quickly
because I only recall being presented with a marvelous opportunity to
follow my own ideas.
   I proposed to make acridine-induced mutants of tRNATyr from E. coli to
determine if altering spatial relationships in tRNA, by deleting or adding a
nucleotide to its sequence, would drastically alter the function of the
molecule. Since Brenner and John D. Smith and their colleagues (Abelson
et al., 1970; Russell et al., 1970; Smith et al., 1971) had just completed a
classic series of studies of base-substitution mutants of tRNATyr, they were
not overly excited by the prospect of someone simply producing more
mutants. Nevertheless, Brenner and Crick did not prevent me from pushing
ahead and John Smith, in time, provided valuable advice about the genetics
of the system in use in the laboratory.
   The mutants I made lacked the usual function of suppressor tRNAs and

made no mature tRNA in vivo, but they reverted at a very high rate (about
1%) to wild type. These properties indicated that there might be an unstable
duplication or partial duplication of the gene for tRNA in the DNA that
contained the information for the tRNA. Furthermore, it seemed likely that
RNA would be transcribed from this mutant gene. I reasoned that if I could
isolate the RNA transcript, which had to be unstable since no mature tRNA
was made, I might be able to understand the nature of the duplication
event.
   The simple expedient of quickly pouring an equal volume of phenol into
a growing culture of E. coli labeled with 32PO 43- enabled me to isolate and
characterize not only the transcript of the gene for tRNA Tyr mutated by
acridines, but also transcripts of the gene for tRNATyr (Fig. 3; Altman, 1971)
which had been previously mutated by other means by Brenner, Smith and
their colleagues. The ability to isolate these gene transcripts, which con-
tained sequences in addition to the mature tRNA sequences at both ends of
the molecules (Fig. 4; Altman and Smith, 1971) and were, therefore, tRNA
precursor molecules, depended on the rapid phenol extraction technique
and the fact that the mutated molecules were less susceptible to attack by

intra-cellular ribonucleases than the transcripts of the wild-type gene. The
 “extra” sequences, themselves, though of interest because no such segments
of gene transcripts had been characterized at that time, proved not to be
particularly revealing per se.
   Although the earlier work of Darnell (Bernhardt and Darnell, 1967),
Burdon (Burdon, 1971; 1974) and their coworkers had shown that tRNAs
were probably made from precursor molecules in eucaryotic cells, further
characterization of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of tRNA, or
tRNA processing events, could not proceed without a radiochemically pure,
homogeneous substrate of the kind that I had isolated.
   When the the precursor to            was mixed with an extract of E. coli, it
was immediately apparent that enzymatic activities were present in the cell
extract that could remove the “extra” nucleotides from both the 5’ and 3’
ends of the mature tRNA sequence (Fig. 5; Altman and Smith, 1971;
Robertson et al., 1972). The activity that processed the 5’ end of the tRNA
precursor, which we named Ribonuclease P, did so by one endonucleolytic
cleavage event in contrast to what appeared to be non-specific exonucleoly-
tic degradation at the 3’ end of the molecule. In fact, no ribonucleases with
such limited specificity with respect to the site of cleavage as that exhibited
by RNase P were known at that time, so the novelty of this reaction assured
our continuing interest in it. Some characterization of the reaction was

immediately carried out in collaboration with Hugh Robertson and John
Smith (Robertson et al., 1972).

Characterization of Ribonuclease P from Escherichia coli
At the MRC laboratory, we showed that RNase P produced 5’ phosphate
and 3’ hydroxyl groups at its site of cleavage (Robertson et al., 1972), unlike
most non-specific nucleases which produce 5’ hydroxyl and 3’ phosphate
groups. This observation fitted with the fact that mature tRNAs have a 5’
phosphate at their 5’ termini. While some progress was made in terms of
chromatographic purification of the enzyme, in retrospect the most striking
observation made in the early studies was that “it is possible that the active
form of RNase P, which must have a strong negative charge, could be
associated with some nucleic acid.” The next important step was taken a few
years later by Benjamin Stark, a graduate student in my laboratory, who
showed that an RNA of high molecular weight copurified with the enzymat-
ic activity and, in a classic experiment, he demonstrated that this RNA
molecule was essential for enzymatic activity (Stark et al., 1978). (The RNA
was named Ml RNA and was later shown to be similar to a stable RNA
species [band IX] of unknown function that had been described by Ikemura
and Dahlberg (19’73) as one of a series of minor RNA species found in E.
coli; the protein subunit of RNase P from E. coli was named C5 protein.)
   The essential role of the RNA component was established by first treating
RNase P with microccocal nuclease, an enzyme that destroys RNA, and
subsequently assaying the treated enzyme for RNase P activity: there was
none after treatment with microccocal nuclease (Fig. 6) or, for that matter,

without micrococcal nuclease (MN) in the pretreatment mixture (A) or without CaCl, (R).
RNase P pretreated with MN had less that 5% the activity of control reaction RNase P. The
extent of inactivation tan be varied by changing the reaction conditions as shown. (Reprinted

after treatment with various proteinases. Thus, under the conditions we
were then using (that is, buffers that contained 10 mM MgCl 2), both protein
and RNA components were shown to be essential for enzymatic activity.
Concurrently we showed that the enzyme had a buoyant density in CsCl of
1.72 g/ml (Stark et al., 1978), characteristic of an RNA-protein complex
that consists predominantly of RNA. Velocity sedimentation experiments
had previously determined the sedimentation coefficient to be 12.5 S (Rob-
ertson et al., 1972).
   While the biochemical purification was proceeding, the study of mutants
of E. coli made by Schedl and Primakoff (1973; Schedl et al., 1974),
Shimura, Ozeki and their coworkers (Ozeki et al., 1974; Sakano et al., 1974)
showed that RNase P was an essential enzyme in E. coli for the biosynthesis
of all tRNAs and that both RNA and protein subunits were required in vivo.
Furthermore, additional work from the laboratories of William McClain
(reviewed in McClain, 1977) and John Carbon (Carbon et al., 1974) added
to the evidence that RNase P was responsible for the processing of many
different tRNA precursor molecules. Although appropriate genetic analy-
ses could not be performed, we also showed that RNase P-like activities


                                    S. Altman                              633


existed in the extracts of cells from many other organisms, including hu-
mans (Altman and Robertson, 1973; Garber et al., 1978). These early
studies showed that RNase P was capable of cleaving many different tRNA
precursor molecules and that there was no identifiable similarity in terms of
nucleotide sequence around the sites of cleavage. The manner in which the
enzyme recognized its sites of cleavage in different substrates with such
selectivity seemed worthy of study, and recognition of some feature of the
structure in solution, common to all tRNA precursor molecules, was sus-
pected.
   When Stark’s experiments were published we did not have the temerity to
suggest, nor did we suspect, that the RNA component alone of RNase P
could be responsible for its catalytic activity. The fact that an enzyme had an
essential RNA subunit, in itself, seemed heretical enough. Shortly there-
after, however, when Ryszard Kole demonstrated that the enzyme consisted
of an RNA (Ml RNA) and a protein subunit (C5 protein; Mr ~ 14,000),
which were not covalently linked and which could be separated into inactive
subunits and then reconstituted to form an active enzyme (Kole and Alt-
man, 1979), the similarities in chemical composition and properties of
assembly of this system to that of the ribosome were sufficiently striking that
we could not escape thinking about the possibility that the RNA, at the very
least, participated in the formation of the active site of the enzyme. Indeed,
making the comparison with ribosomes proved to be important in overcom-
ing some resistance to the idea that an enzyme could have an RNA subunit.
From a purely chemical point of view, there was no reason why RNA could
not participate in formation of the active site (Kole and Altman, 1981) or
even in catalysis itself.
   The advent of recombinant DNA technology and powerful systems for
the transcription in vitro of isolated pieces of DNA enabled us to character-
ize in some detail the RNA subunit of RNase P (377 nucleotides in length;
Reed et al., 1982) and to prepare large quantities for biochemical experi-
ments. Concurrent progress in our purification of the protein subunit
prepared us for a series of experiments, conducted in collaboration with
Norman Pace’s group, in which we made hybrid enzymes with subunits
from E. coli (prepared in our laboratory) and from B. subtilis (prepared in
Pace’s laboratory). As an offshoot of these experiments, Cecilia Guerrier-
Takada in my laboratory was testing reconstituted enzymes under ionic
conditions optimal for the activity of the holoenzyme from B. subtilis and
different from the ones we had previously usually employed. She found, in
control experiments, that the RNA subunit from E. coli, exhibited catalytic
activity of its own in buffers that contained 60 mM MgCl 2 (An example of
such reactions is shown in Fig. 7; in fact the catalytic activity of Ml RNA is
evident when the concentration of Mg2+ is greater than 20 mM; Guerrier-
Takada et al., 1983). The protein subunit of the enzyme increased the        by
a factor of 10-20 but had little effect on the K m. These observations were
possible because of the purity of our preparations of Ml RNA and the use
of a natural substrate, the precursor to tRNATyr from E. coli.

   We quickly determined that Ml RNA had all the properties of a true
enzyme as defined in biochemistry textbooks (Fruton and Simmonds, 1958;
p. 211): it was unchanged (in size) during the course of the reaction; it had a
true turnover number as measured by Michaelis-Menten analysis of the
kinetics (Fig. 8) and, therefore, it was a catalyst; it was needed in only small
amounts and it was stable. Soon thereafter we proposed a model of the
secondary structure of Ml RNA based on its susceptibility to nucleases in
solution and some simple notions of the stability of RNA structures. We also
rapidly outlined the general ionic requirements of the reaction (Table 2;
Guerrier-Takada et al., 1986)). The curve of the dependence of the rate of
the reaction on the pH is flat between 5 and 9 and is suggestive of the
involvement of more than one group with a pK a not characteristic of those
found on nucleotides alone in solution. It is reasonable to expect, there-
fore, that the active site of Ml RNA is embedded in a folded structure and
that the local environment of the active site will not be precisely identical to
that of the aqueous buffer in which the whole molecule is dissolved.

However, our immediate interest was in determining precisely how the
enzyme works, what its role is in vivo, and how it manages to recognize 60 or
so different substrates in E. coli with no apparent sequence specificity
around the site of cleavage.

RECENT WORK
Structure
The original model of the secondary structure of M1 RNA has been exten-
sively refined by phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 9) carried out primarily by Pace
and coworkers (James et al., 1988). However, this analysis has not yet
yielded a satisfactory correlation between the phenotypes of mutants (Lu-
melsky and Altman, 1988) and features of the secondary structure of M1
RNA or its analogs from other bacteria (see below). It does provide the basis
for hypotheses about the regions of M1 RNA that are essential for function
(Waugh et al., 1989), as indicated by evolutionary conservation, and it

highlights the necessity of determining the three-dimensional features of
the structure. To this end, additional phylogenetic comparisons, utilizing
the data concerning the homolog of M1 RNA from several eucaryotic
species (Miller and Martin, 1983; Krupp et al., 1986; Lee and Engelke,
1989), and crystallographic studies are in progress. One observation of
continuing interest from these studies is that the evolutionary clock for both
the RNA and protein subunits of RNase P seems to be a very fast one in
comparison with that for rRNAs (Lawrence et al., 1987; Gold, 1988).
Although the function of RNase P, as judged by the antigenic properties of
the protein (Gold et al., 1988; Mamula et al., 1989), its ability to cleave
various substrates and to reconstitute active enzyme with subunits from
different organisms (Guerrier-Takada et al., 1983; Gold and Altman, 1986;
Lawrence et al., 1987) has been highly conserved, the nucleotide sequences
of the genes for the subunits of the enzyme have drifted extremely rapidly
(Gold, 1988; Bartkiewicz et al., 1989).

Mechanism
The detailed mechanism of the reaction catalyzed by RNase P is not known
but two proposals have been made. In one case (Guerrier-Takada et al.,
1986), a variation of the SN2 in-line displacement mechanism has been
suggested in which a complex between one Mg ion and six water molecules
facilitates the nucleophilic action of a water molecule in solution (Fig. 10).
Investigations of the rRNA self-splicing reaction in Tetrahymenu in Tom
Cech’s laboratory indicate that the original proposal for the mechanism of
the RNase P reaction may also be relevant in the self-splicing reaction
(Cech, 1987; McSwiggen and Cech, 1989). In the other proposal for the
mechanism of the RNase P reaction (Reich et al., 1988), the nucleophile is
derived from groups on the surface of the enzyme and the role of the
magnesium ion is not as clearly specified. Attempts are underway in our
laboratory to test the first model, by the insertion of a phosphothioate bond
at the cleavage site and analysis of the stereochemistry of the cleaved
product.
   While many aspects of structure-function relationships and clues to the
mechanism of the reaction may be revealed if the crystal structure of the
enzyme becomes available, the determination of a crystal structure may
prove to be elusive. We have, therefore, embarked on an attempt to identify
regions of Ml RNA that are critical for the reaction by cross-linking the
substrate to the enzyme by irradiation with ultraviolet light. Such experi-
ments have revealed that a cross-link is formed between a nucleotide close
to the site of cleavage in the substrate (C -3) and residue C92 in M1 RNA
(Guerrier-Takada et al., 1989). If C92 is deleted from M1 RNA, the kinetics
of the enzymatic reaction, and its site of cleavage with particular substrates,
are significantly altered. Furthermore, the region of secondary structure
around C92 in M1 RNA resembles that of the tRNA E site in 23S rRNA
(Fig. 11). Additional studies have shown that this site is important in the
binding of the aminoacyl stem of a tRNA precursor to the enzyme and that,

an O or N atom in M1 RNA. In the middle and bottom panels, the tRNA precursor substrate is
bound by the water molecule attached to M1 RNA and passes through a transition state prior to
cleavage of the “extra” oligonucleotide and prior to the addition of OH to its O5’ terminal
phosphate. After the reaction steps shown here, a solvent water chain between the axial ligands
of Mg 2+ recocks the enzyme for the next cycle. (Reprinted with permission from Guerrier-

as in the binding of tRNA to the E site of 23S rRNA (Moazed and Noller,
1989), the 3’ terminal CCA sequence plays a critical role in the interaction
of the enzyme with the substrate. These results, in addition to allowing the

identification of domains with similar structural and functional properties
in RNA molecules with very different cellular functions, delineate a region
of importance for function in M1 RNA and suggest further experiments for
a more detailed definition of the interactions between enzyme and substrate
and of the particular steps in the enzymatic reaction that involve this region.

Recognition of the substrate
Early notions of the features important for the recognition by RNase P of its
substrate focussed either on the possibility of Watson-Crick pairing of
nucleotide sequences common to all tRNAs (e.g. CCA and UUCG) with M1
RNA (Guerrier-Takada and Altman, 1986) or some other, incompletely
specified, measuring mechanism that recognizes the three-dimensional
structure of the tRNA moiety of the precursor (Bothwell et al., 1976).
Results of several experiments indicated that extensive pairing between
enzyme and substrate was not essential for the enzymatic reaction (Guer-
rier-Takada and Altman, 1986; Baer et al., 1987) and attention was focussed
on the conformation in solution of the substrate. It had been demonstrated
early on that RNase P from any one source can cleave tRNA precursors
from any other source. Thus, when an unusual tRNA which lacked the D
stem and loop was found, namely, tRNASer from bovine mitochondria (de

Bruijn and Klug, 1983), we examined whether M1 RNA could cleave an
analog of a precursor to that tRNA.
   In collaboration with Bill McClain (McClain et al., 1987), we showed not
only that the D stem and loop were not essential for recognition, but also
that the anticodon stem and loop were also dispensible (Fig. 12). A substrate
that consisted merely of a single-stranded region at the 5’ end of a mini-
tRNA, containing only the T stem and loop stacked on the aminoacyl
acceptor stem, was cleaved almost as efficiently as the parent tRNA precur-
sor from which it was derived. This minimal substrate contains an RNA
helix that is analogous to one part of the intact three-dimensional structure
of a normal tRNA (Fig. 2; Rim et al., 1974; Robertus et al., 1974)).
Recently, we have also shown that neither the loop segment of the struc-
ture, nor more than six base pairs in the helical region, and, in separate
experiments, that no more than one “extra” nucleotide at the 5’ terminus
are needed for cleavage by M1 RNA. While substrates with these features
are not cleaved as efficiently as either a normal precursor tRNA or pAT1
(the substrate shown in Fig. 12 that resembles a hairpin), they must, never-
theless, contain sufficient recognition elements to allow the reaction to
proceed. All these model substrates have the 3’ terminal CCA sequence and
none are cleaved at detectable levels when the CCA sequence is altered.
Therefore, it appears that the CCA sequence and at least one half turn of an
RNA helix play an essential role in substrate recognition.

Figure 13. Scheme for formation of substrates for RNase P by hybridization of two oligoribonu-
rleotides. TDF-I (see Fig. 3) was prepared by RNAse P cleavage in vitro of its precursor molecule
that had been transcribed in vitro (see McClain et al., 1987). A portion (boxed sequence) of the
precursor to AT-1 (Fig. 3) was prepared by transcription in vitro of a restriction fragment of the
DNA encoding the AT-I synthetic gene (A.C. Forster, personal communication).


   Conclusions from experiments with model substrates have to be tem-
pered by the knowledge that some recognition elements, which appear to
play a prominent role in these examples, may not play as important a role
and may be supplemented by other elements in the normal tRNA precur-
sors found in cells. It is certainly the case that a change in the D or
anticodon stems of a normal tRNA precursor can have a dramatic effect on
the rate of cleavage by RNase P even though these entire regions of the
substrate are absent in the model substrates.
   Through the hybridization of two oligoribonucleotides as shown in Fig.
13, we can create ad manipulate novel substrates. An “external guide
sequence ” which can guide RNase P to its target, can be hybridized to any
other RNA of known sequence and will form the downstream, or 3’ part, of
the substrate. RNase P should then cleave the hybrid target at the junction
between the single- and double-stranded region at the 5’ side of the double-
stranded region. This new method presents opportunities to investigate
more precisely the details of the recognition mechanism and it also pro-

shown by the shorter line ending in NCCA. N is most frequently found to be A in tRNA
molecules. The region of the EGS shown as hydrogen-bonded is designed to be complementary

vides, in principle, a means to inactivate any mRNA of known sequence in
vivo. Aside from the problem of the expression of the external guide
sequence in vivo, the method does have the advantage that RNase P is
already present in cells of all types. Providing that the hybrid can be
designed to be compatible with the cleavage-site specificity of the enzyme in
the particular host organism of choice, the target RNA should be inactivat-
ed.
   In this example of the use of one oligoribonucleotide to target another
RNA that is to be cleaved by RNase P, substrate recognition by the enzyme
resembles, in a formal sense, selection of the site of cleavage by some of the
other known RNA catalysts. Group I introns and the satellite and similar
RNAs use guide sequences (Cech, 1987; Altman, 1989, for reviews) in the
selection of cleavage sites or to form structures in which a cleavage site
becomes defined. In virtually all other respects, these reactions are quite
distinct from that carried out by RNase P.

The Past, Present and Future of RNase P
The discovery of RNA catalysis has led to new hypotheses about the origin
of the earliest self-replicating biochemical systems from which the question
of the origin of the genetic code can be excluded. Models of these early
systems rely entirely on RNA as the genetic material and as the source of
catalytic activity (Fig. 15; Darnell and Doolittle, 1986; Weiner and Maizels,
1987; Joyce, 1989). All this speculation clearly presupposes that what we see
in present-day systems reflects, in some manner the properties of RNA over

a billion years ago. Should that indeed be the case, the richness of biochemi-
cal mechanisms exhibited by RNA (Table 1) is impressive and can allow for
rather complex systems to develop in the absence of protein and DNA. In
this limited context, we shall consider some aspects of the reactions gov-
erned by RNase P in vitro.
   Although Ml RNA can cleave very simple substrates, it is apparent that
these particular cieavage reactions cannot occur in vivo today because such
cleavages would occur too frequently in the population of RNA in any cell:
that is, the entire population of RNA molecules would be too susceptible to
degradatian by RNase P. However, one can imagine that in an RNA world,
there was considerable advantage to having an RNA molecule that could
identify many sites in very long molecules generated by enzymatic or non-
enzymatic mechanisms. The proliferation of many smaller molecules from
larger ones would give rise to the possibility of a great variety of conforma-
tions of RNA in solution, some of which may have endowed RNA with
catalytic activity or other useful functions very long transcripts did not have.
   Setting aside for the moment the details of the origin of the genetic code
and the appearance of proteins, one can ask, however, why a protein
subunit became associated with Ml RNA. We recently showed that the
protein subunit of RNase P can alter the site of cleavage and affect the rate
of the reaction in a manner sensitive to the nature of the particular sub-
strate being used (Guerrier-Takada et al., 1988; 1989). Thus, it is possible


644                                Chemistry 1989


that proteins may have fine-tuned the site specificity of RNA enzymes by
enhancing the rates of reaction at particular sites and with particular
substrates. What we see today as the “normal” cleavage sites of RNA
enzymes may have been selected for over the eons, in conjunction with the
appearance of protein cofactors, as physiological conditions changed dur-
ing evolutionary time. The “unselected” reactions, for example those with
very small hairpin substrates, became in consequence second- or lower-
order reactions and are no longer relevant to events in vivo.
   Finally, why do RNA enzymes only cleave phosphodiester bonds? There
are three answers that come readily to mind. First and most trivially, RNA
enzymes may cleave other classes of bonds and we just have not yet made
the critical observations or found the right reaction conditions (the last part
of the answer is a generic response to questions about the lack of success in
performing certain reactions in vitro). Second, it is possible that, in the RNA
world, perhaps RNA molecules could only cleave phosphodiester bonds: it
was a primitive world and no other reactions were governed by enzymes.
Once proteins appeared on the scene there was no further need to diversify
RNA enzymes. Lastly, and most important, the chemistry of RNA enzymes,
when sufficiently well-understood, may indicate to us that there is a compel-
ling reason why RNA molecules cleave only phosphoester bonds. The
validity, or lack of it, of this last answer can be tested by direct experimenta-
tion, and therein lies the work of the next several years.
