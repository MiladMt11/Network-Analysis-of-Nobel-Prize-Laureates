              T    he idea that mismatched base pairs occur in cells and that such lesions trig-
                   ger their own repair was suggested 50 years ago by Robin Holliday in the
              context of genetic recombination [1]. Breakage and rejoining of DNA helices was
              known to occur during this process [2], with precision of rejoining attributed
              to formation of a heteroduplex joint, a region of helix where the two strands are
              derived from the different recombining partners. Holliday pointed out that if this
              heteroduplex region should span a genetic difference between the two DNAs,
              then it will contain one or more mismatched base pairs. He invoked processing
              of such mismatches to explain the recombination-associated phenomenon of
              gene conversion [1], noting that “If there are enzymes which can repair points of
              damage in DNA, it would seem possible that the same enzymes could recognize
              the abnormality of base pairing, and by exchange reactions rectify this.”
                   Direct evidence that mismatches provoke a repair reaction was provided by
              bacterial transformation experiments [3–5], and our interest in this effect was
              prompted by the Escherichia coli (E. coli) work done in Matt Meselson’s lab at
              Harvard. Using artificially constructed heteroduplex DNAs containing multiple
              mismatched base pairs, Wagner and Meselson [6] demonstrated that mismatches
              elicit a repair reaction upon introduction into the E. coli cell. They also showed
              that closely spaced mismatches, mismatches separated by a 1000 base pairs or so,
              are usually repaired on the same DNA strand. Based on this strand bias effect,

           Wagner and Meselson proposed that in addition to its role in genetic recombi-
           nation, “. . . mismatch repair may act to correct mutations that arise as replica-
           tion errors. If so, it may be that mismatch repair acts in a directed manner in
           conjunction with sister chromatid exchange or that it occurs with particularly
           high efficiency on newly synthesized DNA strands, possibly because of their
           undermethylation or because of a special relation to the replication complex.”
           This suggestion proved to be particularly insightful, and we now know from
           work in many labs that correction of DNA biosynthetic errors is a primary job
           of mismatch repair [7].
                In order to function in this manner, the repair system must be able to do
           two things. It must recognize the mismatched base pair produced by the repli-
           cation error, but it also has to identify the new DNA strand, which contains the
           mistake. Pat Pukkila in the Meselson lab showed that the strand direction of E.
           coli mismatch repair is dictated by the state of adenine methylation at d(GATC)
           sequences [8]. Because this modification occurs after DNA synthesis, newly syn-
           thesized DNA exists transiently in an unmodified state, and it is this transient
           absence of methylation that directs repair to the new strand (Fig. 1). Consis-
           tent with the idea that mismatch repair contributes to replication fidelity, Miro
           Radman, Barry Glickman, and others [9–11] showed that the methyl-directed
           pathway depends on the products of four E. coli mutator genes: mutH, mutL,
           mutS, and uvrD. Inactivation of any of these genes increases mutation produc-
           tion in the E. coli cell 50- to 100-fold, indicating the importance of this pathway
           in mutation avoidance and genetic stability.
                This is where we entered the picture. I was interested in how mismatches
           might be recognized and how the state of DNA methylation at one site on the

               Norton Zinder’s laboratory at Rockefeller University [12, 13], A-Lien Lu built
               heteroduplex DNAs like that shown in Fig. 2A: circular molecules in which the
               strands are in defined states of d(GATC) methylation and which contain a G-T
               mismatch within the recognition site for EcoRI restriction endonuclease [14,
               15]. Because the mismatch blocks DNA cleavage by EcoRI, digestion of this

           DNA with EcoRI and BamHI endonucleases yields a full-length linear product
           (Fig. 2B, unrepaired). However, if repair occurs on the unmethylated strand, as
           predicted by the Meselson mechanism, the G-T mismatch will be corrected to a
           G-C base pair restoring EcoRI sensitivity, and digestion with EcoRI and BamHI
           will produce the two smaller DNA fragments (Fig. 2B, repaired). In fact, incu-
           bation of this DNA with extracts prepared from broken E. coli cells converts it
           to an EcoRI sensitive form. As anticipated by Meselson and colleagues [8], this
           in vitro reaction is blocked when both DNA strands are methylated, and like in
           vivo methyl-directed repair [9–11], the in vitro reaction depends on functional
           products of the mutH, mutL, mutS and uvrD genes [14, 15].
               Michael Su, Bob Lahue, and Karin Au showed that this in vitro extract reac-
           tion supports repair of all of the base-base mismatches except C-C [16], and
           that at least one hemimethylated d(GATC) site is required for repair to occur
           [17]. The latter finding prompted simplification of our substrates to molecules
           that contain a mismatch and a single d(GATC) site (Fig. 3, upper) separated by

               a thousand base pairs (shorter path). Essentially all of our subsequent work was
               done with molecules like these.
                    A-Lien Lu demonstrated that the extract reaction is accompanied by DNA
               synthesis occurring on the unmethylated strand, suggesting an excision repair
               mechanism [14]. Working in collaboration with Jack Griffith’s lab at the Univer-
               sity of North Carolina, Michael Su and Michelle Grilley confirmed this to be the
               case. Incubation of hemimethylated heteroduplex DNA with E. coli extract under
               conditions of DNA synthesis block resulted in the production of a single-strand
               gap spanning the shorter path between the two sites in the circular DNA [18,
               19], and this was true for both hemimethylated configurations (Fig.3, bottom).
               Because the two strands of the helix are antiparallel, this indicated that there is

           no obligate polarity of the two DNA sites, and suggested that methyl-directed
           repair supports bidirectional excision.
                To clarify how this pathway works we isolated the MutH, MutL, MutS, and
           UvrD proteins in pure form [20–23]. We knew from the prior work of Peter
           Emmerson [24] that the uvrD gene product is DNA helicase II, an enzyme that
           unwinds the two strands of the helix in an ATP-dependent fashion. But the
           nature of the other three proteins was unknown.
                Michael Su showed that MutS is responsible for mismatch recognition [16,
           20; see Fig. 4A]. The ultimate confirmation of this conclusion is the beautiful
           crystal structure of the E. coli MutS dimer bound to a G-T mismatch (Fig. 4B)
           that was solved in Titia Sixma’s laboratory at the Netherlands Cancer Institute
           [25]. Michelle Grilley showed that MutL is recruited to the MutS-heteroduplex
           complex in an ATP-dependent reaction (Fig. 4C), but does not otherwise alter
           the covalent nature of the helix [22]. Kate Welsh and A-Lien Lu found that the
           MutH protein has a very tightly associated, but nearly dead (< 1 turnover/hour)
           endonuclease activity that incises DNA at an unmethylated d(GATC) sequence
           [21]. As discussed below, assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex ternary com-
           plex leads to dramatic activation of this latent MutH d(GATC) endonuclease.
                Because these four proteins are not sufficient to support mismatch repair,
           Bob Lahue and Karin Au used biochemical and genetic approaches to iden-
           tify other required components, and they identified four: exonuclease I, which
           hydrolyzes single-stranded DNA with 3′ to 5′ polarity, the E. coli single strand
           DNA binding protein SSB, DNA polymerase III holenzyme, which functions in
           DNA replication, and DNA ligase [23]. They showed that a system comprised
           of MutH, MutL, MutS, UvrD (DNA helicase II), exonuclease I (Exo I), SSB,
           DNA polymerase III holoenzyme, and DNA ligase was sufficient to reconstitute
           methyl-directed mismatch repair in vitro.
                The assay used in these reconstitution experiments was a refined version of
           the one described in Fig. 1. In this example shown in Fig. 5A, a G-T mismatch is
           placed in overlapping recognition sites for two restriction enzymes, HindIII and
           XhoI. The mismatch blocks cleavage by both enzymes, but repair on the bottom
           strand generates an A-T base pair and a good HindIII site, while repair on the
           top strand produces a G-C base pair and a good XhoI site. This permits repair
           on either strand to be directly scored. A heteroduplex that lacks a d(GATC)
           site is not a substrate for the purified system (Fig. 5B, lanes 1 and 2), nor is a
           heteroduplex in which both strands are methylated (lanes 3 and 4). However,
           hemimethylated DNA is repaired. When the methyl group resides on the strand
           containing the mismatched G, repair is exclusively to G-C (lanes 5 and 6), and
           when the strand containing the mismatched T is methylated, repair is to A-T

                   As described above, analysis of the extract reaction suggested a bidirectional
               excision capability, which would presumably depend on both 3′ to 5′ and 5′
               to 3′ exonucleases. This proved to be correct. Deani Cooper, Vickers Burdett
               and Celia Baitinger [26–28] showed that when the unmethylated d(GATC)
               sequence resides 5′ to the mismatch, in vitro repair absolutely depends on 5′

           to 3′ excision by exonuclease VII (ExoVII) or RecJ exonuclease. Collaborative
           experiments with Susan Lovett’s lab showed that in vitro repair directed by a
           d(GATC) sequence located 3′ to the mismatch depends on 3′ to 5′ hydrolysis by
           Exo1 or ExoX [26, 28], although ExoVII (which supports both 5′ to 3′ and 3′ to
           5′ hydrolysis [29]) may also play a limited role in 3′-directed excision [28]. Our
           original reconstitution experiments, which contained only ExoI [23], were suc-
           cessful because the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme preparations used in these
           early studies were contaminated with ExoVII [26].
               Although extracts prepared from RecJ– ExoVII– ExoI– Exo X– E. coli cells
           are completely defective in both 3′- and 5′-directed mismatch repair, this strain
           displays only a 7-fold increase in mutation rate, substantially less than the 30- to
           100-fold mutability increases observed with MutS– or UvrD– cells [28]. This par-
           adox was resolved with the demonstration that production of mismatched base
           pairs in RecJ– ExoVII– ExoI– Exo X– cells results in loss of viability in manner
           that depends on upstream action of MutH, MutL, MutS, and UvrD proteins [27].
           These findings confirm involvement of the four exonucleases in methyl-directed
           mismatch repair in the E. coli cell and suggest that reduced mutability of the
           exonuclease-deficient strain is due to under recovery of mutants as a conse-
           quence of chromosome loss.
               Availability of the required set of purified E. coli proteins permitted us to
           address the mechanism of the methyl-directed reaction. Mismatch recognition
           by MutS leads to recruitment of MutL to the heteroduplex (Fig. 6). MutL serves
           to interface mismatch recognition by MutS to activation of downstream repair
           activities, one of which is MutH, the latent d(GATC) endonuclease mentioned
           above. Karin Au showed that methyl-directed repair initiates by activation of
           MutH endonuclease in a mismatch, MutS, and MutL dependent fashion [30].
           DNA incision by activated MutH is targeted to the unmethylated stand at a

               match, consistent with a bidirectional mechanism, and the resulting strand break
               that is the actual signal that directs mismatch repair to the unmethylated strand.
                   Assembly of the MutL-MutS-heteroduplex complex also activates the exci-
               sion system, which is comprised of the uvrD gene product, DNA helicase II,
               and the four single-strand exonucleases mentioned above (Fig. 7). Vivian Dao
               and Miyuki Yamaguchi demonstrated that MutS and MutL load DNA helicase
               II at the MutH strand break with an orientation bias so that unwinding of the
               helix proceeds toward the mismatch [31, 32]. This loading bias is true for both
               heteroduplex orientations, without regard to location of the strand break 5′ or 3′
               to the mismatch. The single-strand displaced by helicase unwinding is degraded
               by ExoVII or RecJ when the nick is located 5′ to the mismatch, and by ExoI or
               ExoX when the break is 3′ to the mispair. The single-strand gap produced in
               this manner is repaired by the components of DNA polymerase III holoenzyme,
               and although not shown in Fig. 7, DNA ligase restores covalent continuity to the
               product. Anna Pluciennik showed that function of the polymerase III holoen-
               zyme components is restricted to the repair synthesis step of E. coli mismatch
               correction, and have no involvement in the MutH activation or excision steps
               of repair [33]. This is noteworthy because the human pathway described below
               differs in this respect.
                   Methyl-directed repair clearly involves action at a distance, effective interac-
               tion of two DNA sites that in our substrates are separated by a thousand base
               pairs. But the mechanism by which this occurs has been a subject of debate

           for almost 20 years [34, 35]. The orientation-dependent loading of helicase II
           summarized in Fig. 7 indicates that the repair system can establish the relative
           orientation of the mismatch and d(GATC) site, which implies that signaling
           must occur along the helix contour between the two sites. There is good evidence
           from multiple labs that MutS and probably the MutL·MutS complex can move
           along the helix in an ATP-dependent manner [34–36], and we favor the idea that
           signaling between the two sites is mediated by this sort of movement. However,
           this point is not yet proven.
                As our work on E. coli mismatch repair progressed, we were curious whether
           a similar stand-directed pathway might exist in higher cells. Work from multiple
           labs indicated that mismatches are rectified in eukaryotic cells [37–40], but there
           was no evidence for strand-directed repair. The problem we had in addressing
           this question was the lack of information concerning the nature of the biological
           strand signals. To circumvent this problem Jude Holmes, an M.D./Ph.D. student
           who began this work, exploited a finding we had made in the E. coli system
           described above, namely that the function of MutH and the hemimethylated
           d(GATC) strand signals in the bacterial reaction is provision of a strand break,
           which serves as the actual signal that directs methyl-directed mismatch repair.
           Jude constructed heteroduplex DNAs that contained a site-specific strand-spe-
           cific nick (Fig. 8A) and found that these DNAs are subject to repair on the nicked
           DNA strand in extracts prepared from human (Fig. 8B) or Drosophila melano-
           gaster cells [41]. No significant repair occurs on the continuous strand, and when
           both strands are covalently continuous, repair is blocked. Furthermore, Woei-
           horng Fang demonstrated that DNA hydrolytic events occurring on these DNAs
           are largely restricted to the shorter path between the nick and the mismatch
           regardless of 5′ or 3′ orientation of the two DNA sites (Fig. 8A) [41a]. This is
           reminiscent of bidirectional methyl-directed repair, but as described below, the
           mechanism of the human reaction differs in fundamental ways from that of the
           E. coli pathway.
                The development that permitted us to identify the key proteins involved
           in the initiation of human mismatch repair and to pursue the mechanism of
           the reaction was the publication in 1993 of two papers from de la Chapelle,
           Vogelstein, and Perucho laboratories [42, 43]. These papers showed that a high
           frequency of mutation within simple mononucleotide and dinucleotide repeat
           sequences, a phenotype called microsatellite instability, is characteristic of cer-
           tain cancers, including tumors that occur in patients with Lynch syndrome (also
           called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or HNPCC), a common heredi-
           tary cancer that accounts for about 5% of colon cancers, and about 15% of spo-
           radic cancers with Lynch-like features [44, 45].

               defective in mismatch repair. We acquired a number of microsatellite unstable

           permitted us to identify and isolate the repair components lacking in these lines
           (Fig. 9B and C). Jim Drummond and Guo-Min Li showed several of these lines
           to be deficient in MutSα, a heterodimer of the two MutS homologs MSH2 and
           MSH6 [48, 51], which proved to be the primary human mismatch recognition
           protein [52]. Guo-Min Li identified the repair activity lacking in the other cell
           lines as MutLα, a heterodimer of the MutL homologs MLH1 and PMS2 [49].
           While we were pursuing these biochemical studies, several labs, primarily those
           of Richard Kolodner and Bert Vogelstein, were sequencing MutS and MutL
           homolog genes in Lynch families. They showed the mutations in these genes seg-
           regate with disease phenotype [53, 54], and it is now quite clear that the majority
           of Lynch syndrome cancers are caused by defects in one of these two heterodi-
           mers [44, 45]. Inactivation of mismatch repair in these tumor cells increases the
           rate of mutation production 100 to 1000-fold [55–57], which is believed to play
           a direct role in the development of these cancers.
               The last four tumor cell lines shown in Fig. 9A proved to be exceptional: each
           is derived from a sporadic cancer with microsatellite instability and each is defec-
           tive in mismatch repair. Jim Drummond and Guo-Min Li showed that these cell

               lines fail to produce the MLH1 subunit of MutLα and that repair is restored to
               extracts in each case by addition of purified MutLα [50]. However, we encoun-
               tered skepticism when we shared these findings with some of our sequencing
               colleagues, who told us that they had sequenced the MLH1 gene in several of
               these lines, and it was normal. But Sandy Markowitz (Case Western Reserve
               University), with whom we were working on several of these cell lines, took us
               seriously, and collaborative experiments largely done in Sandy’s lab showed that
               the MLH1 gene in these cell lines is epigenetically silenced by CpG methylation
               within the promoter region [50]. The gene is normal, but it is not transcribed
               and MLH1 polypeptide is not produced, resulting in a mismatch repair defect.
               The proof for this conclusion is shown in Fig. 10. Exposure of these microsatellite
               unstable, sporadic cancer cells to 5-azacytidine, which leads to transient cytosine
               demethylation, results in transient expression of MLH1. This effect is important
               in the clinics, where silencing of the MLH1 locus is believed to account for about
               15% of colon cancers [58].
                   In addition to MutSα (recognizes base-base and small insertion/deletion
               mismatches of 1 to about 3 extrahelical residues) and MutLα, genetic and bio-
               chemical studies have implicated six additional proteins in eukaryotic mis-
               match repair: MutSβ (MSH2-MSH3 heterodimer; prefers insertion/deletion
               mismatches of 2 to about 10 extrahelical residues [52, 59–61]), exonuclease 1
               [62–64], the single-strand DNA binding protein RPA [65, 66], the PCNA slid-
               ing clamp [67], the clamp-loader RFC [68], and DNA polymerase δ [69]. These
               8 proteins are sufficient to reconstitute a minimal system that supports human
               bidirectional mismatch repair in vitro [68, 70]. We identified two strand-directed
               reactions, which are supported by subsets of these proteins, that provide insight
               into the mechanisms of human mismatch repair.

               The simplest of these (Fig. 11) is in a sense a trivial example of strand direc-
           tion. The only exonuclease definitively implicated in eukaryotic mismatch repair
           is exonuclease 1 (Exo1), which hydrolyzes duplex DNA with 5′ to 3′ polarity
           [62–64]. Jochen Genschel demonstrated that Exo1 is activated by MutSα in a
           mismatch-dependent manner [64, 71], and similar results have been obtained
           in Guo-Min Li’s laboratory [72]. Like bacterial MutS, MutSα is capable of ATP-
           dependent movement along the helix [34–36], and we think it likely that such
           movement serves to couple action at the two DNA sites. Activation by MutSα
           renders Exo1 highly processive. Processive action of the MutSα-Exo1 complex
           is controlled by the RPA single-strand binding protein, which displaces the pro-
           cessive complex from the helix after removal of about 200 nucleotides [71, 73].
           The resulting RPA-filled gap is a poor substrate for Exo1, and the enzyme cannot
           reload without the mismatch-dependent assistance of MutSα. This leads to an
           iterative cycle of removal of about 200 nucleotides per Exo1 reloading event that
           continues until the mismatch is removed, at which point excision is dramatically
           attenuated because MutSα can no longer promote Exo1 loading. MutLα is not
           required for this reaction, but it modestly enhances the mismatch dependence

               poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase PARP-1 further potentiates mismatch depen-
               dence in this system [74].
                   The second strand-directed reaction is more interesting (Fig. 12). Farid
               Kadyrov, Leo Dzantiev, and Nicoleta Constantin demonstrated that unlike E. coli
               MutL, human MutLα is a latent endonuclease that is activated in a manner that
               depends on a mismatch, a preexisting strand break, MutSα, the PCNA sliding
               clamp, and RFC, the clamp loader that places PCNA on the helix [75]. Endo-
               nuclease action is strand-directed: it is targeted to the heteroduplex strand that
               contains the preexisting break. Incision by activated MutLα can occur at multiple
               sites on the pre-incised strand, but initial events appear to be biased to the distal
               side of the mismatch. This reaction occurs on both 5′ and 3′ heteroduplexes to
               yield molecules in which the mismatch is bracketed by 5′ and 3′ strand breaks.
               Farid Kadyrov showed that these 5′-termini serve as loading sites for two alter-
               nate modes of mismatch removal: hydrolytic excision by MutSα-activated Exo1
               [75] or synthesis-driven strand displacement by DNA polymerase δ (Fig. 13)
               [75a]. Other excision mechanisms may also be possible.
                   We believe that endonuclease action is a primary function of MutLα in
               eukaryotic mismatch repair. The basis for this conclusion is shown in Fig. 14.
               Farid identified a DQHA(X)2E(X)4E metal-binding, endonuclease active site
               motif within the C-terminal domain of the PMS2 subunit of MutLα (Fig. 14,
               motif highlighted in red). Amino acid substitutions within this motif have no
               effect on stability of the MLH1-PMS2 heterodimer, MutLα ATPase activity, or
               assembly of the MutLα-MutSα-heteroduplex ternary complex, but they inacti-

               Although not present in members of the MLH1 family, the DQHA(X)2E(X)4E
           endonuclease motif is conserved in eukaryotic PMS2 homologs. It is also found
           in many bacterial MutL proteins (Fig. 14), and recent work has shown that like
           human and yeast MutLα, at least some of these bacterial MutL proteins function
           as endonucleases [78]. The notable exceptions are MutL proteins from bacteria
           like E. coli and related organisms that rely on d(GATC) methylation to direct
           mismatch repair, where this motif is conspicuously absent. Like E. coli MutL
           [22, 76], these latter proteins presumably lack endonuclease function. Thus two
           distinct mechanisms for strand-targeting of mismatch repair occur in nature.
               The mechanism of MutLα activation is complex, but Anna Pluciennik and
           Leo Dzantiev have clarified several of its features [79]. They showed that the only
           function of the preexisting strand break within the heteroduplex (Fig. 12) is to
           provide a loading site for the PCNA sliding clamp, and that RFC involvement
           in MutLα activation is restricted to loading of the clamp onto the helix. Loaded

               PCNA plays two important roles in the reaction. Physical interaction of MutLα
               with the loaded clamp is required for endonuclease activation, and the orienta-
               tion with which PCNA is loaded onto the helix determines strand direction of
               endonuclease action [79]. These functions of the loaded clamp are illustrated in
               the model shown in Fig. 15. The two faces of the PCNA clamp are not equiva-
               lent, and RFC loads the clamp at a 3′-double strand-single strand junction with
               a unique orientation (depicted in Fig. 15 with gold face oriented toward the 3′
               terminus). The Jiricny and Kolodner labs have shown that MutSα is tethered to
               the replication fork via physical interaction with PCNA [80, 81], and both of
               these proteins are capable of movement along the helix [34–36, 82]. Mismatch
               recognition by MutSα triggers recruitment of MutLα, which is capable of inter-
               acting with both proteins. The idea is that the asymmetry of clamp loading is
               preserved in the MutLα-PCNA complex, and this serves to uniquely orient the

           Figure 15. Strand direction of MutLα endonuclease action is determined by the orienta-
           tion with which the PCNA sliding clamp is loaded onto the DNA helix.



               When we began our work on human mismatch repair, we had no idea con-
           cerning the nature of the biological strand signals, although we and others had
           suggested that DNA termini that occur naturally during the course of DNA rep-
           lication might suffice in this regard [41, 67, 83]. The strand-directed reactions
           described above are consistent with this view. 5′ termini on the lagging strand at
           the replication fork would presumably support loading of MutSα-activated Exo1,
           and genetic studies from the Kolodner and Kunkel laboratories are compatible
           with this idea [81, 84]. Furthermore, strand direction of MutLα endonuclease
           action is controlled by the loading orientation of the PCNA clamp on the helix,
           which in turn is determined by 3′-termini on the leading and lagging strands at
           the fork. It therefore seems likely that 5′ and 3′ DNA termini that occur natu-
           rally during the course of DNA replication serve as default signals that direct
           mismatch repair in the eukaryotic cell.
