In introducing this summary of experiments on two enzymes, we wish to
indicate that the information is representative of what biochemists are obtain-
ing about many proteins. An understanding of the host of reactions in which
proteins participate in living cells requires information on the molecular ar-
chitectures of a wide variety of proteins of different origins and different
functions. Such information is coming from laboratories all over the world
and draws upon a rich heritage of experience from many investigators. And
such knowledge is fundamental to progress in medical research; the Nobel
awards this year in Chemistry (concerning ribonuclease) and in Physiology
or Medicine (concerning antibodies) both concern basic researches on the
chemistry and the biology of proteins.
   Occasionally (1) it has been educational to write the structural formula for
ribonuclease in full, in terms of its 1,876 atoms of C, H, N, O, and S. Portrayal
of the complete molecule with all of the atoms of the amino groups, carboxyl
groups, hydroxyl groups, guanido groups, imidazole rings, phenolic groups,
indole rings, aromatic, aliphatic, and thiother side chains, sulfhydryl groups,
and disulfide bonds, helps in the visualization of the almost infinite number
of ways in which such groups could be arranged. This characteristic of pro-
teins makes it possible for nature to design catalysts for such a variety of
specific reactions. There is no law that says that a nucleic acid or a polysaccha-
ride could not be an enzyme. But it is understandable that the enzymes so far
isolated have turned out to be proteins; a protein is equipped to participate,
sometimes through cooperation with coenzymes, in the whole lexicon of or-
ganic reactions that require catalysis in the living cell.

P URIFICATION      OF    R   IBONUCLEASE

The first step in the study of the structure of ribonuclease was, of course, its
purification. Ribonuclease was first described in 1920 by Jones (2), who
showed that there was present in beef pancreas a relatively heat-stable enzyme
capable of digesting yeast nucleic acid. Dubos and Thompson (3) partially
purified the enzyme some eighteen years later and in 1940 Kunitz (4) described
the isolation of bovine ribonuclease in crystalline form after fractionation by
ammonium sulfate precipitation. In order to be as certain as possible that we
were beginning the structural study with a single molecular species, we under-

took to apply the potential resolving power of ion exchange chromatography
to ribonuclease (Fig. 1). While Werner Hirs, in our laboratory, was exploring
the chromatographic purification of ribonuclease on the polymethacrylic
resin Amberlite IRC-50 (5,6), Paléus and Neilands (7), in Stockholm, were
studying cytochrome C on the same exchanger. These two proteins were
the first molecules of their size to be thus purified. The best resolution for ri-
bonuclease (Fig. 2) is now obtained (8) with an exchanger invented in Upp-
sala, a sulfoethyl cross-linked dextran, which was a development that grew
from Porath and Flodin’s (9) experiments on gel filtration and drew upon
Sober and Peterson’s (10) emphasis on the advantages of a carbohydrate
matrix for the exchanger.
   When pancreatic extracts were analyzed without prior fractionation, two
peaks of enzymatic activity were observed by us (6) by ion exchange chromato-
graphy and by Martin and Porter (11) by partition chromatography. The
major component, ribonuclease A, was selected for the first structural studies.
(In later independent experiments, Plummer and Hirs (12, 13) isolated ri-
bonuclease B in pure form from pancreatic juice and showed it to be the same
as A but with the addition of a carbohydrate side chain attached to one aspara-
gine residue.)

The second step in the structural study of ribonuclease A was the determina-
tion of the empirical formula of the chromatographically homogeneous protein
in terms of the constituent amino acids. Our appreciation of the importance
of quantitative amino acid analysis began in the late 1930’s when we had the
special privilege of starting our postdoctoral studies in apprenticeship to Max

Bergmann (14). In 1945 it was possible to take a new look at the subject in the
light of the renaissance in chromatography stimulated by Martin and Synge
in the early 1940’s (15 - 17). In 1949, by combining a quantitative photometric
ninhydrin method (18) with elution of amino acids from starch columns by
alcohol : water eluents (19, 20) on an automatic fraction collector (21), we
were able to analyze a protein hydrolysate in about two weeks by running
three such chromatograms to resolve all overlaps. In the early 1950’s, the
process was speeded up to one week (Fig. 3) by turning to ion exchange
chromatography on a sulfonated polystyrene resin (22, 23). In 1958, in co-
operation with Darrel Spackman (25, 26) the process was automated (Fig. 4)
to give recorded curves (Fig. 5) and the speed was increased to give an over-
night run. Shorter columns and faster flow rates (27) permitted an analysis
time of about 6 hours. Results from many academic and industrial laboratories
have helped to make the procedures simpler and more rapid. Some recent
users have adopted 2-hour systems (cf. (28)) and the ninhydrin reagent has
been improved (29). In the 1970’s, a number of industrially designed analyzers
with increased automation have reduced the time for a complete analysis to
about 1 hour and increased the sensitivity to the nanomole range. The sharing
of knowledge among academic scientists and industrial designers of instru-
ments and manufacturers of ion exchangers has played an important role in
progress of biomedical research in this field.
   In 1972 there are continuing developments that may make amino acid
chromatography more ultramicro and more expeditious. These contributions
include the introduction by Udenfriend and his colleagues of an analog of
ninhydrin (30-32) that yields, at room temperature, a fluorescent product
that can be detected at extremely low concentrations; there is also the con-
tinuing possibility that gas chromatography can give fully satisfactory results
with amino acid derivatives.
   The precision and the sensitivity of current procedures for amino acid anal-
ysis have been recently reviewed (33). The developmental research on

 quantitative amino acid analysis has also yielded procedures for the isolation
 of amino acids on a preparative scale (34, 35), for the determination of D -
 and L-amino acids (36, 37), for the analysis of hydrolysates of foods (38, 39),
 and for the determination of free amino acids in blood plasma (40), urine (41),
 mammalian tissues (42), topics that extend beyond the scope of this lecture.
 Specific discoveries from such studies include the findings by Harris Tallan
 of 3-methylhistidine (43) and tyrosine-O-sulfate (44) in human urine, acetyl-
 aspartic acid in brain (45), and cystathionine in human brain (46).


 S TRUCTURE   OF   R IBONUCLEASE
 The empirical formula of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (Table I), deter-
 mined by the chromatographic methods applied during the structural study,
 turned out to be that of a molecule containing 124 amino acid residues. From
 the known mechanisms of protein biosynthesis, coupled with the susceptibility
 of the peptide bonds to enzymatic hydrolysis, all of the residues are almost
 certainly of the L-configuration. The calculated molecular weight is 13,683.
    The experience with amino acid chromatography led us to try to develop
 column methods with sufficient resolving power for the separation of the pep-
 tides formed by the enzymatic hydrolysis of performic acid-oxidized ribo-
 nuclease (47), as in the chromatogram illustrated in Fig. 6 from the experiments
 of Werner Hirs, who was the first postdoctoral associate to join our laboratory.
 Fifteen young scholars began their postgraduate careers on the researches
 summarized in this lecture. Each citation of their contributions connotes our

recognition of the ideas, the hard work, and the enthusiasm that facilitate
productive research; each of these biochemists shares the credit for the results
reported on this occasion and we continue to be stimulated by their current
independent accomplishments.
   Werner Hirs, through gradient elution from Dowex 50-X2, obtained 100%
yields of the peptides that were completely liberated by tryptic hydrolysis.
The elucidation of the sequences of amino acid residues in the peptides and
the crossword puzzle-like ordering of the peptides followed many of the prin-
ciples established by Sanger (48) in his pioneering determination of the struc-
ture of insulin, but with the larger molecule of 124 amino acid residues quanti-
tative methods were particularly helpful in the interpretation of the results.
A key chemical method in studies of molecules of this size has been the se-
quential degradation method developed by Pehr Edman (49) with phenyliso-
thiocyanate as the reagent. Instead of determining the resulting phenylthio-
hydantoins, we have generally used a subtractive procedure in which we utilize
the amino acid analyzer to tell us which amino acid has been removed in each
step.
   The formula for ribonuclease (Fig. 7), largely developed by Werner Hirs
 (50, 51), Darrel Spackman (52) and Derek Smyth (53, 54), but drawing
 importantly upon the results of several key experiments by Christian B.
 Anfinsen and his associates (55-57), in Bethesda, is here written with the
 customary abbreviations. Ribonuclease was the first enzyme for which the

sequence could be written and the determination of its structure was a logical
sequel to Sanger’s success with the hormone insulin.
   The writing of such a two-dimensional formula is only the first step. Linder-
strøm-Lang (58) referred to such a sequence as the primary structure of the
protein. Catalysis is a three-dimensional operation which involves what Lang
termed the secondary and tertiary structures of the chain.

   As chemists, we had made some predictions, through derivatization experi-
ments, about residues that were folded together to form the active center of
ribonuclease. Through Gerd Gundlach’s studies on the inactiation of ribo-
nuclease by alkylation with iodoacetate (59) and Arthur Crestfield’s demonstra-
tion of the reciprocal alkylation of two essential histidine residues by iodoacetate
at pH 5.5 (60), we concluded that the imidazole rings of histidine-119 and his-
tidine-12 were at the active center and were about 5 Å apart. Robert Heinrik-
son, in our laboratory, from experiments on the alkylation of lysine at pH 8.5
(61), and drawing upon independent dinitrophenylation experiments by Hirs
et al. (62), further concluded that the           group of lysine-41 was probably
7 - 10 Å from the imidazole ring of histidine-12 and somewhat further removed
from histidine-119.
   But the chemical approach does not begin to provide enough data to build
an adequate model of an enzyme as a whole. The great advances in X-ray
crystallography pioneered by Perutz (63) and Kendrew (64) have opened a
whole new chapter in this regard, with knowledge of the sequence, at least
in considerable part, being a pre-requisite for the solution of the X-ray problem
in the present state of the art. We were waiting with great anticipation for the
results of X-ray analysis of crystals of ribonuclease which came in 1967 through
the researches of Kartha, Bello, and Harker (65) on RNase A and Wyckoff
and Richards and their associates (66) on RNase S. In the S-form of the enzyme
(67, 68), which is fully active, the chain has been cleaved primarily between
the 20th and 21st residues by controlled proteolysis with subtilisin.
   Examination of the model shows the approximate positions of the imidazole
rings of histidines-12 and -119 and the ε-amino group of lysine-41 to be com-
patible with the chemical predictions. The substrate for RNase (Fig. 8) is
ribonucleic acid, which, from the results of experiments in the laboratories of

Todd, of Cohn, and of Markham (reviewed in (69)) is cleaved at the 5’-phos-
phate ester bond following a pyrimidine-containing nucleotide to give, by
transphosphorylation, the 2’, 3’-cyclic phosphate which, in a second step, is
hydrolyzed to the 3’-ester. The X-ray data show that the substrate fits in a
trough on the surface of the protein with the phosphate moiety near the two
imidazole rings of histidines-12 and -119 and with the pyrimidine ring tucked
into a hydrophobic pocket close to the aromatic ring of phenylalanine-120
   From this picture of the active site (reviewed in (70)), chemical and physical
experimentation is progressing in a number of laboratories toward definition
of the catalytic process in as explicit terms as possible with primary roles for
one charged imidazole and one uncharged imidazole participating in the push-
pull which results in transphosphorylation or hydrolysis of the phosphate ester
bond.
   These further experiments carry the subject into the third chapter in the
history of ribonuclease, its chemical synthesis, which has grown from the
many innovations in the methods for peptide synthesis in recent years. A prep-
aration with 70 % of the activity of native ribonuclease has been synthesized
through a major effort by Gutte and Merrifield (71, 72). An active RNase
S-protein has been synthesized by Hirschmann, Denkewalter and associates
(73). The yields in the syntheses are dependent upon a very important property
of the disulfide bonds of RNase studied by White (74) and by Anfinsen and
his associates (75) and reviewed particularly in terms of its special biological
significance by Anfinsen (76). The reduced chain with 8 -SH groups folds to
give the proper pairs of S-S bonds for the active conformation of the protein.
The intramolecular forces that guide such a folding, and the similar forces that
contribute to the specific aggregation of the chains of a protein with multiple
subunits, such as hemoglobin, form a continuing subject of research.
   The ability to synthesize RNase, or major parts thereof, opens new avenues
for the identification of residues that may be essential for activity through
the preparation of analogs of ribonuclease with substituitions at specific posi-
tions. Hofmann and Scoffone and their respective associates (reviewed in (70))
have done this at the amino end of the chain by synthetic variations in Richards’
S-peptide. We have cooperated with Merrifield and his associates in the follow-
ing recent series of experiments which illustrate the application of chemical
surgery to the COOH end of the molecule and the use of synthetic replace-
ments.
   How can we examine the question of whether the proximity of the aromatic
ring of phenylalanine-120 and the pyrimidine ring of the substrate leads to
specific interaction between two six-membered rings in a way which is im-
portant in the binding of substrate to enzyme ? Michael Lin, in our laboratory,
was able to cut off, enzymatically (by pepsin according to Anfinsen (77) plus
carboxypeptidase A) the last 6 residues from ribonuclease which include
phenylalanine-120 and histidine-119. The resulting molecule (78) is completely
inactive and does not bind substrate. Concurrently, Gutte and Merrifield had
synthesized the 14-residue L-peptide from glutamic acid-l11 through valine-
-124. When this synthetic fragment is mixed with the molecule missing residues


                                         W.H. Stein                                      89


119 to 124, the added peptide is adsorbed and 90% of the activity of the
native enzyme is regained (79). The missing histidine is thus supplied for the
active center; other residues in the peptide adsorb on the protein core in such
a way as to re-form the binding site and the catalytic site. This result parallels
in principle the earlier experiments of Richards and Vithayathil (68) on the
removal and adsorption of the S-peptide at the NH2 end.
   When leucine or isoleucine is substituted for phenylalanine at position 120
in the synthetic peptide, the combination of peptide and protein has 10%
of the activity of ribonuclease and binds substrate as effectively as the native
enzyme (80). In this way we conclude that the aromatic ring is not essential for
binding of the pyrimidine ring or for activity. But the lower activity when
leucine or isoleucine is substituted indicates that the aromatic ring of phenyl-
alanine fits into the hydrophobic pocket more specifically than the aliphatic side
chains and probably serves to orient histidine-119 more exactly in: the delicate
balance with histidine-12 that gives the active site its full catalytic power.
   Another way to learn what residues can be varied without loss of activity is
to study the changes in pancreatic ribonucleases from different species, as
has been done for the enzymes from sheep (81), rat (82), and pig (83, 84).

D   EOXYRIBONUCLEASE

A further way to gain insight into what makes ribonuclease so specific for its
special substrate is to look at enzymes that hydrolyze similar substrates. In
the past few years we have turned our attention to pancreatic deoxyribonuclease.
This enzyme, which is about twice the size of ribonuclease, hydrolyzes DNA
in the presence of bivalent cations, such as Mn++ , to give 5’-mononucleotides
and larger fragments (85). Deo xyribonuclease first attracted special attention
in the classic work of Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty (86, 87), who showed
that the transforming principle of the pneumococcus could be destroyed by
the action of the enzyme. McCarty’s (88) experiments on the purification of
the enzyme from pancreas were followed by those of Kunitz (89) and of

Lindberg (90). Our studies began when Paul Price, as a graduate student,
undertook the chromatographic purification of deoxyribonuclease. His initial
studies showed that the enzyme, in the absence of bivalent metals, was extreme-
ly sensitive to proteolysis. Success in the purification depended upon keeping
metals such as Ca++ present or adding diisopropyl phosphorofluoridate to
inactivate the pancreatic proteases. He succeeded in resolving preparations
of deoxyribonuclease into two active components on sulfoethyl-Sephadex (91)
and Hans Salnikow subsequently obtained even higher resolving power (Fig. 9)
with phosphocellulose (92). There are three main active components: DNase
A is a glycoprotein, DNase B is a sialoglycoprotein, and DNase C is similar
to A but with a proline residue substituted for one histidine. These three
deoxyribonucleases were also present in the pancreatic juice from a single
animal.
   The determination of the chemical structure of DNase A was undertaken by

Hans Salnikow (93) and carried to completion this year by Ta-hsiu Liao (94).
The working hypothesis for the structure of the molecule (Fig. 10) indicates
a single chain of 257 residues with two disulfide bonds. The ordering of the
tryptic and chymotryptic peptides in the reduced and carboxymethylated
chain and the pairing of the half-cystine residues in the native enzyme were
greatly facilitated by the cleavage of the molecule at the four methionine resi-
dues by the cyanogen bromide by the method of Gross and Witkop (95). Amino
acid analyses at the nanomole level made possible sequence determinations
on small amounts of peptides isolated by chromatography or paper electro-
phoresis.
   Some of the special features of the structure can be discussed in reference to
the diagram in Fig. 11. The carbohydrate side-chain, which contains 2 residues
of N-acetylglucosamine and 2 to 6 residues of mannose (91, 92, 96) and
which Brian Catley showed was attached via an aspartamidohexosamine
linkage to a -Ser-Asn-Ala-Thr- sequence (96), is found at only one position in
the chain, at residue 18. Tony Hugli studied the nitration of deoxyribonuclease
(97) by tetranitromethane (98); the enzyme is inactivated by the modification
of one tyrosine residue which turns out to be residue 62. Paul Price discovered
that inactivation of DNase by iodoacetate in the presence of Cu++ and Tris
buffer (99) is accompanied by carboxymethylation of one residue of histidine;
from the sequences of a 3-carboxymethylhistidine-containing peptide and
that of the protein, the essential imidazole ring is found to be in residue 131.
DNase C (92) is the result of a mutation which causes one histidine to be replac-
ed by a proline without any change in the activity. Hans Salnikow and Dagmar
Murphy (100) have shown that this change occurs at position 118; the histidine
at this position in DNase A is thus not essential for enzymatic activity.

   The two disulfide bonds of deoxyribonuclease possess some unusual prop-
erties. Paul Price showed that even without the use of a denaturing agent both
bonds are very easily reduced by mercaptans in the absence of calcium to give
an inactive product. In the presence of calcium, one bond is stable and one
bond is reduced (101) and the product is active. Ta-hsiu Liao has identified
the non-essential disulfide bond as the one forming the small loop between
residues 98 and 101 (94). When the larger loop, formed by half-cystines 170
and 206, is opened, the activity is lost.
   The next step will be the correlation of the chemical evidence with the three-
dimensional structure of the enzyme, if X-ray analysis of crystalline DNase A
can be successfully accomplished.

CO N C L U S I O N
In the course of studying enzymes of different functions, we have had the
pleasure of cooperation with Kenji Takahashi in the identification of a carboxyl
group of glutamic acid as part of the active site of ribonuclease T, (102).
The essential -SH group and histidine residue of streptococcal proteinase have
have been studied in collaboration with Stuart Elliott and Teh-yung Liu
(103, 104). The esterification of carboxyl groups at the active center of pepsin
was explored with T. G. Rajagopalan (105). There is a vast amount of basic
information needed on various enzymes before biochemists can explan catalytic
action in full detail. Enzyme chemistry today is in a stage of development that
bears some similarity to that of organic chemistry at the beginning of this
century. At that time there was great activity in documenting the properties
of the myriad small organic compounds conceivable by man and nature.
Today, in the polypeptide field, the list of determined structures is relatively
small. The enzymes that have been studied first are those that can be prepared
in gram quantities, such as ribonucleaase, trypsin, lysozyme, carboxypeptidase,
and subtilisin. The experience in the determination of such structures is leading
to ultramicromethods which will extend the range of structural studies to tissue
enzymes that are present in very small amounts.
   From the knowledge of the structures of a large series of enzymes, underlying
principles of how nature designs catalysts for given purposes will evolve.
And there will be practical dividends from such research on proteins. One
example of research-in-progress can illustrate this possibility. The project devel-
oped in the following way: In the course of examining the importance of the
three-dimensional configuration of RNase to its activity, George Stark had
occasion to dissolve the enzyme in 8 M urea at 40° (106). In one of those
experiments the RNase was not active after the urea was removed by dialysis,
and it turned out that traces of cyanate in the urea solution had carbamylated
the         groups of the enzyme. The chemistry of the subject carries us back
to Wöhler’s (107) observations on the relationship between ammonium cyanate
cyanate and urea in 1828. In 1970, Anthony Cerami and James Manning
(108), two young investigators at the Rockefeller University, undertook to
explore, fully on their own initiative, whether traces of cyanate in urea might
have a role in the reported beneficial effect of urea on the sickling of erythro-

cytes of individuals carrying hemoglobin S. They have discovered that there
is such an effect of cyanate on human erythrocytes, and that it is accompanied
by carbamylation of the α-NH, groups of the valine residues of the α- a n d
          of hemoglobin S. The knowledge that a relatively simple chemical
modification of hemoglobin S can restore nearly normal function to the de-
ficient molecule opens the possibility that a genetic defect in man might be
remedied, not by having to change the gene, but by redivatizing the protein.
   Such results afford an example of the manner in which one finding leads to
another in basic research and ultimately to possible benefits to man. When
we consider biochemistry in 1972, it is important to realize how fragmentary
is our knowledge of the molecular basis of life. Very few macromolecules can
be discussed in the detail with which ribonuclease or hemoglobin can be de-
fined. Such knowledge of structure-function relationships is basic to the
rational approach to the intricate synergisms of living systems.
