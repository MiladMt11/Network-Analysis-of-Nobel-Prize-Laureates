1. INTRODUCTION
The secretary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, the famous chemist
Jöns Jacob Berzelius, published since 1820 annual review articles on the most
significant new developments in his field. Since the early 19th century there
were observations from several laboratories whereafter certain substances
influenced the progress of a chemical reaction without being consumed and
hence apparently not being affected by this reaction. For example, Johann
Wolfgang Doebereiner, professor of chemistry at the university of Jena, re-
ported in July 1823 to his minister, J. W. Goethe, “that finely divided platinum
powder causes hydrogen gas to reaction with oxygen gas by mere contact to water where-
by the platinum itself is not altered” [1]. In his report published 1835 Berzelius
defined this phenomenon as “catalysis”, rather in order to introduce a classi-
fication than to offer a possible explanation [2]. Throughout the rest of this
century the term catalysis remained heavily debated [3], until around 1900
W. Ostwald proposed its valid definition in terms of the concepts of chemical
kinetics: “A catalyst is a substance which affects the rate of a chemical reaction with-
out being part of its end products” [4]. In 1909, Ostwald was awarded the Nobel
Prize in Chemistry for his contributions to catalysis.
   A chemical reaction involves breaking of bonds between atoms and the
formation of new ones. This process is associated with transformation of en-
ergy and the energy diagram illustrating the progress of a reaction A+BlC is
depicted schematically in fig. 1. The activation energy E* to be surmounted
is usually provided by thermal energy kT, with k being Boltzmann’s constant
and T the temperature, and accordingly not all molecular encounters will be
successful, but only a fraction e-E  -E** /kT
                                              . An increase of the reaction probability
(=rate) can be achieved by either increasing the temperature or by lowering
the activation energy E*. The latter is provided by the catalyst which through
the formation of intermediate compounds with the molecules involved in the
reaction provides an alternate reaction path as sketched y the dashed line in
fig. 1 which is associated with smaller activation barriers and hence a higher

overall reaction rate. In the last step the product molecules are released from
the catalyst which now is available for the next reaction cycle. If the reacting
molecules and the catalyst are in the same (gaseous or liquid) phase the ef-
fect is called homogeneous catalysis. In living systems macromolecules (=en-
zymes) play the role of catalysts. In technical reactions mostly the interaction
of molecules with the surface of a solid is decisive. The principle of this het-
erogeneous catalysis is depicted schematically in fig. 2.

                                                                                     117


   The atoms in the surface layer of a solid have fewer neighbours than those
in the bulk and are hence chemically unsaturated and may form new bonds
(=chemisorption) with suitable molecules impinging from the adjacent gas
or liquid phase. By this step existing bonds will be modified or may even be
broken (=dissociative chemisorption). The surface species formed may jump
from one site to neighbouring ones, then may react with others, and the
formed produced molecules eventually leave the surface (=desorption). If
operated in a flow reactor, the catalyst can in this way continuously operate
without being consumed.
   One of the first and still most important technical applications of this prin-
ciple was realized about 100 years ago: Due to the continuous increase of the
world population and the exhaust of the natural supply of nitrogen fertilizers
the world was facing a global threat of starvation. As Sir William Crookes,
president of the British Association for the advancement of sciences, formu-
lated it [8]: “… all civilized nations stand in deadly peril of not having enough to
eat. … the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen is one of the great discoveries awaiting the
ingenuity of chemists”.
   Nitrogen fixation means transformation of the abundant N2 molecule
(which constitutes about 80% of our air) from its state of very strong bond
between the two N atoms into a more reactive form according to the reac-
tion N 2 3H 2 l 2NH 3. This reaction of ammonia formation could be realized
in 1909 by F. Haber (Nobel Prize 1919) in the laboratory by the use of an
osmium catalyst in a high pressure flow apparatus [6]. C. Bosch (Nobel Prize
1931) from the BASF company started immediately to transform this process
into technical scale, and the first industrial plant started operation in 1913,
only a few years later. Fig. 3 shows the growth of the world population to-
gether with the ammonia production over the last century [7], and it is quite
obvious that our present life would be quite different without the develop-
ment of the Haber-Bosch process.

century [7].

   However, large scale technical production would not have been possible
without the availability of large quantities of a cheap catalyst. (The whole
world supply of the precious metal osmium was only 80 kg in those days.)
This task could be solved successfully by A. Mittasch [8] who in thousands of
tests found that a material derived from a Swedish iron ore exhibited satisfac-
tory activity. This type of doubly-promoted iron catalyst is in fact still in use
today in almost all industrial plants.
   Remarkably, despite the enormous technical significance of the Haber-
Bosch reaction and despite of numerous laboratory studies its actual mecha-
nism remained unclear over many years. P. H. Emmett, one of the pioneers
of catalysis research, was honoured in 1974 by a symposium where he con-
cluded at the end [9]: “The experimental work of the past 50 years leads to the
conclusion that the rate-limiting step in ammonia synthesis over iron catalysts is the
chemisorption of nitrogen. The question as to whether the nitrogen species involved is
molecular or atomic is still not conclusively resolved …”.


2. THE SURFACE SCIENCE APPROACH TO HETEROGENEOUS
CATALYSIS: AMMONIA SYNTHESIS
The problem involved in the study of the surface chemistry of ‘real’ cata-
lysts becomes evident if we look on an electron micrograph of the Mittasch
catalyst as reproduced in fig. 4 [10]: A catalyst with high activity has to ex-
hibit a rather high specific surface area which in this case is about 20 m2/g
as reflected by nanometer sized active particles. (In fact catalysis has been
a nanotechnology long before this term was introduced). Under reaction
conditions these are reduced into metallic iron covered by a submonolayer
of K(+O) which acts as ‘electronic’ promoter. The configuration of active
particles is stabilized against sintering by a framework of Al2O3 (and CaO)
which compounds act as ‘structural’ promoters. The active component itself
will expose different crystal planes apart from various defects, and all these
various structural parameters are expected to exhibit varying reactivity.
Apart from that, how can the two-dimensional chemistry taking place in the
chemisorbed overlayer be investigated down to the atomic scale?
   A possible strategy to overcome this problem had been suggested by I.
Langmuir (Nobel Prize 1932) already many years ago [11]: “Most finely divid-
ed catalysts must have structures of great complexity. In order to simplify our theoretical
consideration of reactions at surfaces, let us confine our attention to reactions on plane
surfaces. If the principles in this case are well understood, it should then be possible to
extend the theory to the case of porous bodies. In general, we should look upon the sur-
face as consisting of a checkerboard …”
   The ‘surface science’ approach which Langmuir had in mind was experi-
mentally not yet accessible in his days, but began to become only available
during the 1960’s with the advent of ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) and surface
sensitive physical methods [12]. Nowadays a whole arsenal of such tech-
niques is available to study the structural, electronic or dynamic properties of
such well-defined single crystal surfaces.

sis catalyst [10].

   Bond-breaking upon chemisorption is perhaps the most important role of
a catalyst. Fig. 5 shows schematically the energetic transformations in such
a process if a diatomic molecule interacts with a perfect surface. Upon ap-
proaching the surface the molecule may initiate the formation of new bonds
to the surface atoms whereby the bond between the two atoms is weakened.
A corresponding one-dimensional energy diagram as proposed by Lennard-
Jones [15] is depicted in fig. 5a: If the molecule A2 forms a bond with the
surface a shallow minimum (A2,ad) is reached. If instead the free A2 molecule
dissociated the dissociation energy Ediss is needed. Chemisorption of two A
atoms would be associated with strong bond formation (2Aad), and the cross-
ing point between the two curves obviously marks the activation energy for
dissociative chemisorption, viz. A2 l 2Aad. Even more instructive is a two-
dimensional diagram (fig. 5b), where lines of equal energy are plotted as
a function of the distance x between the molecule and the surface and the
separation y between the two atoms. (A full multi-dimensional description
would require knowledge of the energy also as function of the point of impact
within the unit cell of the surface as well as of the orientation of the molecular
axis, and theory is nowadays able to provide this information as well as on the
dynamics of energy transfer between the different degrees of freedom [14].)
   Fig. 6 shows a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) picture from a
Pt(111) surface with atomic resolution after exposure to a small amount of
O2 molecules at 165 K [15]. Apart from the Pt atoms from the topmost layer
additional features, namely pairs of bright dots surrounded by dark rings are
visible. The dots mark the positions of O atoms resulting from dissociative
chemisorption. While at 120 K instead chemisorbed O2 molecules would be
discernible, at 165 K the thermal energy suffices to overcome the activation
barrier for dissociation. The dark rings around the bright spots reflect the
modification of the local electronic structure near the chemisorbed species.
As a consequence neighboring particles interact with each other through the
electronic system of the substrate, whereby these interactions may be repul-

sive as well as attractive [18]. At the low temperature of 165 K, on the other
hand, the chemisorbed O atoms are immobile and rest at those sites at which
transfer of the chemisorption energy to the solid has been completed. This
process requires a certain relaxation time during which the two separating
O atoms move apart from each other. That is why two O atoms are never on
neighboring sites, but are typically separated by 0.5 – 0.8 nm from each other.
Taking into account the chemisorption energy released leads to an estimate
of about 3x10-13 s for the lifetime of these ‘hot’ adsorbed atoms.
   More detailed insight into the dynamics of energy exchange between the
solid and chemisorbed species can be obtained by application of ultrafast
(femtosecond) laser techniques, and it can be generally concluded that with
metal surfaces complete thermal equilibrium between all degrees of freedom
is typically reached after about 10-12 s [17].
   The mean residence time of a chemisorbed particle on its momentary ad-
                                   *
sorption site is given by T T oeE diff /kT whereby E *diff is the activation energy for
surface diffusion to a neighboring site. ( E *diff is always much smaller than the
adsorption energy, so that the adsorbed particles makes many jumps before
it eventually desorbs into the gas phase.) Fig. 7a shows a snapshot taken with
a fast STM from a Ru(001) surface at 300 K covered by a small concentration
of O atoms. The latter jump around like with two-dimensional Brownian
motion with a mean T of about 6x10-2 s. However, T varies with the mutual
separation between two neighboring O atoms due to the operation of the
above mentioned interactions and reaches about 0.22 s if the two O atoms
are separated from each other by 2 lattice constants [19]. As a consequence
of the operation of these weak attractive interactions at higher surface con-
centrations the adsorbed particles are no longer uniformly and randomly
distributed across the surface, but segregate into two phases as shown in fig.
7b: A two-dimensional quasi-solid phase is in equilibrium with a quasi-gas
phase, where continuous nucleation, condensation and sublimation occur
like in analogous solid-gas equilibria. From such observations it becomes
also obvious that definition of a surface diffusion coefficient for adsorbates
is meaningful only at low surface concentrations as long as the adsorbed par-
ticles can be considered to be independent from each other [20].
The formation of ordered adsorbate phases with long-range periodicity like
in fig. 7b is quite common and permits determination of the actual structural
parameters by a diffraction technique, preferably low energy electron dif-
fraction (LEED) [12]. If we now return to the original problem of ammonia
synthesis, dissociative chemisorption of nitrogen on various Fe single crystal
surfaces causes indeed also the formation of such structures derived from
chemisorbed N atoms, such as reproduced in fig. 8 for the c2x2-N phase on
the Fe(100) surface [21]. The probability for this process (=sticking coef-
ficient) is very low, typically of the order 10-6, which reflects the fact that this
step is indeed rate-limiting in the overall reaction of ammonia synthesis. Fig.
9 shows the variation of the surface concentration y (in relative units) of N
atoms chemisorbed on various Fe single crystal surfaces with exposure (i.e.
number of molecules impinging per cm2 and s) to N2 gas at T = 693 K [22].

is about the exposure which would suffice to form a complete monolayer if each incident
molecule would be adsorbed).


There is a pronounced influence of the surface structure: The most densely
packed (110) surface is least active, while the open (111) plane exhibits the
highest sticking coefficient and is indeed also responsible for the overall
activity of the industrial catalyst [23]. This activity is further enhanced by
the presence of the electronic promoter K which stabilizes the intermediate
N2,ad complex and hence increases its dissociation probability [24]. The same
sequence in reactivity as found for the sticking coefficient for dissociative ni-
trogen adsorption under low pressure conditions was also found for the yield
of ammonia production at 20 bar pressure [25]. Thus it is also demonstrated
that in this case there exists no ‘pressure gap’.

   All further steps involved in the ammonia synthesis reaction could be iden-
tified and analyzed similarly, so that the overall mechanism and energy dia-
gram reproduced in fig. 10 could be derived [26]. This diagram exhibits the
general features of the schematic diagram of fig. 1: Instead of overcoming
the prohibitive high energy barrier for dissociation of the reacting molecules
the catalyst offers an alternate reaction path through formation of intermedi-
ate chemisorption complexes whose energy differences can be readily sur-
mounted by the available thermal energy.
   The kinetic parameters associated with the individual reaction steps can
be put together to calculate the steady-state yield of ammonia formation for
given external parameters. Fig. 11 shows a plot of the ammonia yield derived
on the basis of this kinetic model as a function of the experimental yields in
industrial plants [27]. The data points barely deviate from the straight line
which marks complete agreement between theory and experiment. This
result could be confirmed also by others [28] and demonstrates that in this
case the ‘surface science’ approach is indeed able to lead even to a quantita-
tive description of an industrial reaction of great relevance.

3. SELF-ORGANISATION AND COMPLEXITY: OXIDATION OF
CARBON MONOXIDE
One of the major applications of heterogeneous catalysis in our days con-
cerns protection of the environment through removal of toxic substances
from car exhausts. Oxidation of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide,
2CO O 2 l 2CO 2 , is the simplest of these reactions and is depicted sche-
matically in fig. 12. The exhaust gas flows through the catalytic converter
where the molecules interact with the surfaces of finely divided metal par-
ticles from the platinum group. Thereby the O2 molecules are dissociatively
chemisorbed, and the formed Oad species interact with chemisorbed CO
molecules to CO2 which is immediately released into the gas phase.




Figure 12. Cartoon illustrating a car exhaust catalyst and the mechanism of CO oxidation.


   The structures formed by chemisorbed O and CO on a Rh(111) surface as
example are shown in fig. 13 [29]: The CO molecules are in this case bonded
through the C atom in ‘on top’ positions. They exhibit always the tendency
for the formation of densely packed layers, eventually even with occupancy
of different adsorption sites [30] (fig. 13a). The O atoms, on the other hand,
occupy threefold-coordinated sites and form a rather open mesh of a 2x2-
structure (fig. 13b). Since an O2 molecule in order to become dissociated
requires an ensemble of neighboring empty surface atoms, this process will


126


be inhibited as soon as the CO coverage exceeds a certain critical value. The
open structure of the adsorbed O-layer, on the other hand, still permits ad-
sorption of CO, leading to a mixed phase as reproduced in fig. 13c where the
two reactants are in close contact and can readily recombine to CO2. Under
steady-state flow conditions in a mixture of O2+CO the surface of the catalyst
will soon be fully covered by adsorbed CO which prevents oxygen adsorption
and hence suppresses the reaction. This problem can only be overcome if
the temperature is high enough (≥450 K) to enable continuous desorption
of part of the adsorbed CO so that gaseous O2 may compete for these free
adsorption sites. (This is the reason why the catalyst of your car does not work
in the cold but needs a certain minimum temperature.) The sequence of
reaction steps and the energy diagram for this reaction is depicted in fig. 14:
After chemisorption of the reactants, Oad+COad may recombine according
to the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism [31] by overcoming an activation
barrier of 100 kJ/mol (which is only about half as high at higher coverages
[31]), − a result which could also be confirmed theoretically on the basis of
DFT calculations [32].

   Under steady-state flow conditions the rate of product formation will usu-
ally be constant and a function of the external parameters temperature and
partial pressure of O2 and CO, − however, with exceptions under rare condi-
tions: Already around 1970, it was found in Wicke’s laboratory [33] that with
supported Pt catalysts sometimes the rate exhibits temporal oscillations. Such
a situation can also be found with a well-defined Pt(110) surface as shown
in fig. 15 [34]: At the time marked by an arrow the O2-pressure was steplike
raised from 2.0 to 2.7x10-4 mbar. As a consequence the rate slowly increases
and then develops periodic variations with finally constant high amplitudes.

   Characteristic for the present system is that it is far away from equilibrium
and may develop so-called dissipative structures as explored in detail by
Prigogine (Nobel Prize 1977) [35] and by Haken [36] in the framework of
synergetics. A particularly spectacular example for such behavior from popu-
lation dynamics is reproduced in fig. 16 [37] which shows the variation with
time of the number of furs from hares and lynxes delivered to Hudson’s Bay
Company. The oscillating populations of both species are coupled to each
other with a certain phase shift. The reason seems to be quite obvious: If
the lynxes find enough food (=hares) their population grows, while that of
the hares decays as soon as their birth rate cannot compensate their loss any
more. When the supply of hares drops, the lynxes begin to starve and their
population also decays so that that of the hares can recover. The variations of
the populations of the two species x and y can be modeled in the language of
chemical kinetics in terms of two coupled nonlinear (ordinary) differential
equations (Lotka-Volterra model) as shown in fig. 17 together with their solu-
tion for properly chosen parameters A and B. This solution exhibits just the
qualitative behavior of the data of fig. 16.

   Mathematical description in terms of nonlinear differential equations is es-
sential for these effects, and therefore this field is also denoted as nonlinear
dynamics.
   With the oscillatory kinetics in the CO oxidation on Pt(110) the situation
is still somewhat more complicated. In this case the reason for this effect
has to be primarily sought in the structure of the Pt(110) surface and its
transformation under the influence of adsorbates. As already recognized by
Langmuir [38]: “The atoms in the surface of a crystal must tend to arrange them-
selves so that the total energy will be a minimum. In general, this will involve a shifting
of the positions of the atoms with respect to each other.”

face, b) the 1x1-structure representing termination of the bulk structure.




130


   Such a reconstruction is exhibited by the clean Pt(110) surface [39].
Instead of the termination by the corresponding bulk crystal plane (fig. 18b
= 1x1 structure), every second row along the ;1 1 0= direction is missing, giving
rise to as 1x2-structure (fig. 18a). In this way small facets with (111)-orienta-
tion are exposed, leading to a lower energy than with the 1x1-phase. The two
phases differ also with respect to their adsorption properties: Chemisorption
of CO is accompanied by a higher adsorption energy on the 1x1-phase than
on the 1x2-structure, so that local 1x2l1x1 transformation takes place as
soon as the CO coverage exceeds a value of 0.2 monolayers (ML) [40]. On
the other hand, the sticking coefficient for dissociative oxygen coverage on
the 1x1-phase exceeds that on the 1x2-phase by about 50% [41]. The occur-
rence of temporal oscillations in the rate of CO2 can now be rationalized as
follows: If a clean Pt(110) surface (1x2) is exposed to a proper mixture of
CO+O2, adsorption of CO will suffice to cause local 1x2l1x1 transforma-
tion. On the newly created 1x1-patches, the oxygen sticking coefficient will
be higher, so that a higher O coverage will be built up, giving rise to an en-
hanced production of CO2. By this latter process the excess CO will be con-
sumed so that the surface structure transforms back from 1x1l1x2, and one
cycle is completed. Mathematical modeling requires in this case three vari-
ables, the coverages of O and CO, and the fraction of the surface being pres-
ent as 1x1-phase. Solution of the resulting 3 coupled nonlinear differential
equations for properly chosen parameters is shown in fig. 19 and reproduces
the experimental findings [42].

   However, so far the story is still incomplete: If the elements of an extended
system exhibit temporal oscillations as a whole, some kind of lateral coupling
between these elements is required in order to achieve synchronization. As a
consequence of these considerations the state variables (i.e. the surface con-
centrations of the adsorbates xi) are in general not only depending on time
t but also on the spatial coordinates ri. As summarized in fig. 20 coupling be-
tween different regions on the surface is achieved by transport processes. If
the heat capacity of the catalyst is low enough, spots with surface concentra-
tions favouring higher reaction rates will also attain higher local temperature
due to the exothermicity of the overall reaction, and then heat conduction
across the catalyst surface will provide coupling between different parts. Such
a situation will usually be found with oscillatory kinetics on supported cata-
lysts under high pressure conditions [43], but has also been studied in detail
with a very thin (~200 nm) Pt(110) single crystal foil, where periodic varia-
tion of the reaction rate caused corresponding changes of the temperature.
The latter effect initiated varying thermal expansion and hence deformation
which was denoted as ‘heartbeats of a catalyst’ [44].

surface concentrations cause surface diffusion of the adsorbates, and
mathematical description can now be obtained in terms of reaction-diffusion
equations, i.e. a set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations com-
bining the kinetics with the diffusion of the adsorbed species (fig. 20). The
length scale of the resulting spatio-temporal concentration patterns is no
longer governed by atomic dimensions but by the so-called diffusion length,
which in our case is of the order of tens of microns [45]. These patterns were

imaged by the technique of photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM)
[46]: Adsorbed O and CO species are accompanied by different electric
dipole moments and hence different work function changes which in turn
give rise to varying intensities of photoemitted electrons. In the images to be
shown dark areas are essentially O-covered while brighter patches are CO-
covered. As an example fig. 21 shows so-called target patterns, concentric
elliptic features propagating preferentially along the ;1 1 0= -direction of the
Pt(110) surface (where CO diffusion is faster than along the [001]-direction)
on a background changing periodically between bright (=CO covered) and
dark (=O covered), while the external parameters of temperature and partial
pressures are kept constant as indicated [47].

again real-time movies were presented.


   Under other external parameters typical spiral waves as shown in fig. 22
develop and propagate with front speeds of a few Mm/s. The core of a spiral
is often formed by a region on the surface with enhanced defect density, and
this effect is also responsible for the fact that the wavelengths of the spiral
vary to some extent [48].

   Since the mechanism of this reaction and all its parameters are well estab-
lished experimentally, these data may also be used to simulate the resulting
patterns by numerical solution of the underlying differential equations. This
is shown in fig. 23 for the case of spiral wave development [49]. If the param-
eters are slightly changed, the solution exhibits no longer regular spirals, but
they break-up to the situation of spiral-turbulence or spatio-temporal chaos
(fig. 24). Experimental verification of such a situation is demonstrated by fig.
25.

   We reached now a state where a system which in principle is very simple (a
chemical reaction occurring between two diatomic molecules on a well-de-
fined single crystal surface with fixed external parameters and for which all
individual reaction steps are known) and which nevertheless exhibit rather
complex behavior. Such effects are generally expected for open systems far

from equilibrium and are hence believed to govern also the whole nature.
Our system can be considered to be a rather simple model for studying these
types of phenomena. One might for example be interested to modify pattern
formation from outside by affecting one of the control parameters. This can
be done either locally be heating a small spot on the surface by laser light
[50] or globally by a feedback mechanism in which the actual reaction rate
(or integral coverage of one of the surface species) is used to regulate the
flow of one of the reacting gases [51]. A series of patterns created in this way
from a turbulent initial state by different strength and delay of the feedback
is reproduced in fig. 26. These patterns are reminiscent of similar phenom-
ena found in nature (fig. 27), but also on Vincent van Gogh’s vision of our
world in his painting “star night” (fig. 28).

4. CONCLUSIONS
This is no review article but a brief account for a broader audience of
some of the work which had been considered to be the basis for the award.
Numerous coworkers were involved in our continuing attempt to understand
how chemical reactions on solid surfaces take place. Without their efforts the
results presented could not have been achieved, and therefore I am heartily
grateful to all of them. Their names as well as a complete bibliography up to
2004 can be found in a recent special issue of J. Phys. Chem. B [59].
