I. INTRODUCTION
This Nobel Lecture provides me with an exceptional opportunity to trace my
research program in boranes from its inception in 1936, as an investigation
initiated for my Ph.D. thesis, to the present time, when this program has been
recognized by the award of the Nobel Prize for 1979 (shared with my good
friend, Georg Wittig).
   In 1936 diborane, B 2 H 6 , was a rare substance, prepared in less than gram
quantities in only two laboratories, that of Alfred Stock at Karlsruhe, Germany,
and of H. I. Schlesinger, at the University of Chicago. The existence of the
simplest hydrogen compound of boron, not as BH 3 , but as B 2 H 6 , was con-
sidered to constitute a serious problem for the electronic theory of G. N. Lewis: [1]
The reactions of diborane were under study at the University of Chicago by
Professor H. I. Schlesinger and his research assistant, Anton B. Burg, in the
hope that a knowledge of the chemistry would aid in resolving the structural
problem.
   I received the Assoc. Sci. degree from Wright Junior College (Chicago) in
1935 and the B.S. degree from the University of Chicago in 1936. Why did I
decide to undertake my doctorate research in the exotic field of boron hydrides?
As it happened, my girl friend, Sarah Baylen, soon to become my wife,
presented me with a graduation gift, Alfred Stock’s book, The Hydrides of Boron
and Silicon.[1] I read this book and b ecame interested in the subject. How did it
happen that she selected this particular book? This was the time of the Depres-
sion. None of us had much money. It appears that she selected as her gift the
most economical chemistry book ($2.06) available in the University of
Chicago bookstore. Such are the developments that can shape a career!
   Shortly before I undertook research on my Doctorate, H. I. Schlesinger and
Anton Burg had discovered that carbon monoxide reacts with diborane to
produce a new substance, borane-carbonyl, H 3BCO[2]. There was considerable
discussion as to whether the product was a simple addition compound, or
whether the reaction had involved a migration of a hydride unit from boron to
carbon.

It was thought that an understanding of the reaction of diborane with aldehydes
and ketones might contribute to a resolution of this problem. Accordingly, I
was encouraged to undertake such a study.
   Once I mastered the high-vacuum techniques developed by Stock for work
with diborane, it did not take me long to explore the reactions of diborane
with aldehydes, ketones, esters, and acid chlorides. It was established that
simple aldehydes and ketones react rapidly with diborane at 0° (even at -78°) to
produce dialkoxyboranes (1).




These dialkoxyboranes are rapidly hydrolyzed by water to give the correspond-
ing alcohols (2).




The reactions with methyl formate and ethyl acetate were slower, but
quantitative reductions were achieved. No appreciable reaction was observed
with chloral, acetyl chloride, and carbonyl chloride. [3].
   My Ph.D. thesis was completed in 1938 and the contents were published in
1939.[3] At the time the organic chemist had available no really satisfactory
method for reducing the carbonyl group of aldehydes and ketones under such
mild conditions. Yet little interest in this development was evinced. Why?
   In 1939 diborane was a very rare substance, prepared in only minor amounts
in two laboratories in the world, handled only by very specialized techniques.
How could the synthetic organic chemist consider using such a rare substance
as a reagent in his work?
   It would be nice to report that one of the three authors had the foresight
to recognize that the development of practical methods of preparing and
handling diborane would make this reductive procedure of major interest to
organic chemists throughout the world. But that was not the case. The problem
was later solved, but primarily because of the requirements of research support-
ing the war effort, and not because of intelligent foresight.


I I . TH E A LK A LI M ETA L H Y D R I D E ROUTE TO DIBORANE AND
BOROHYDRIDES
In 1939 Anton B. Burg transferred to the University of Southern California
and I became research assistant to Professor Schlesinger. In the Fall of 1940 he
was requested to undertake for the National Defense Research Committee a
search for new volatile compounds of uranium of low molecular weight. As his
research assistant, I became his lieutenant in this war research program.
  J u s t p r i o r t o t h i s d e v e l o p m e n t , a l u m i n u m borohydride [ 4 ] A l ( B H 4 ) 3 ,
beryllium borohydride,[5] Be(BH 4) 2, and lithium borohydride, [6] LiBH 4, had
been synthesized in our laboratories. The lithium derivative was a typical non-
volatile, salt-like compound, but the aluminum and beryllium derivatives


                                   H. C. Brown                              343


were volatile, the most volatile compounds known for these elements. Ac-
cordingly, we undertook to synthesize the unknown uranium (IV) boro-
hydride (3).




The synthesis was successful.[7] Moreover, the product, U(BH 4 ) 4 , had a low
molecular weight (298) and adequate volatility. We were requested to supply
relatively large amounts of the material for testing.
   The bottle-neck was diborane. We had six diborane generators operated by
six young men. Each generator could produce 0.5 g of diborane per 8-hour
working day, a total production, when all went well, of 3 g per day, or 1 kg per
year! Clearly, we had to find a more practical route to diborane.
   We soon discovered that the reaction of lithium hydride with boron tri-
fluoride in ethyl ether solution provided such a route[8] (4).




We could now prepare diborane in quantity and transform it into uranium (IV)
borohydride by simple reactions (5, 6).




Unfortunately, we were informed that lithium hydride was in very short supply
and could not be spared for this synthesis. We would have to use sodium
hydride instead.
   Unfortunately, with the solvents then available, the direct use of sodium
hydride was not successful. However, a new compound, sodium trimethoxy-
borohydride,[11] readily synthesized from sodium hydride and methyl borate,
solved the problem (7).




It proved to be very active and provided the desired transformations previously
achieved with lithium hydride (4-6).
   At this stage we were informed that the problems of handling uranium
hexafluoride had been overcome and there was no longer any need for uranium
borohydride. We were on the point of disbanding our group when the Army
Signal Corps informed us that the new chemical, sodium borohydride appeared
promising for the field generation of hydrogen. However, a more economical


344                                Chemistry 1979


means of manufacturing the chemical was required. Would we undertake a
research program with this objective?
   We soon discovered that the addition of methyl borate to sodium hydride
maintained at 250° provided a mixture of sodium borohydride and sodium
methoxide[12] (8).


                                                                              (8)

This provides the basis for the present industrial process for the manufacture of
sodium borohydride.

III. REDUCTIONS WITH COMPLEX HYDRIDES
In the course of search for a solvent to separate the two reaction products,
acetone was tested. Rapid reduction of the acetone was observed [9] (9).


                                                                              (9)




In this way it was discovered that sodium borohydride is a valuable reagent
for the hydrogenation of organic molecules.
   At this stage I departed the University of Chicago for Wayne University
(Detroit). With the much smaller opportunities for research at this institution,
I concentrated on my program dealing with steric strains. [13, 14]
   At the University of Chicago the alkali metal hydride route was successfully




  In 1947 I came to Purdue University with the opportunity for markedly
expanding my research program. I decided to explore means of increasing the
reducing properties of sodium borohydride and of decreasing the reducing

properties of lithium aluminum hydride. In this way the organic chemist would
have at his disposal a full spectrum of reducing agents - he could select that
reagent which would be most favorable for the particular reduction required
in a given situation.


346                                    Chemistry 1979


   Indeed, it has proven possible to enhance the reducing power of a borohydride
 (LiEt 3BH)[20] until it exceeds that of lithium aluminum hydride and to
diminish the reducing power                         so that it is even less than that
of the parent borohydride (Fig. 2).
   Finally, we discovered major differences between reduction by electrophilic
reagents, such as diborane[22] and aluminum hydride,[23] and by nucleophilic
reagents, such as sodium borohydride [16] and lithium aluminum hydride[16]
(Fig. 3). It is often possible now to reduce group A in the presence of B, or
group B in the presence of A, by a careful choice of reagents. This is nicely
illustrated by the synthesis of both (R )- and (S )-mevalonolactone from a
common precursor [24, 25] (Fig. 4).
   It should be pointed out that these studies were greatly facilitated by many
exceptional coworkers, among whom I would like to mention especially, Nung
Min Yoon and S. Krishnamurthy.

IV. HYDROBORATION
In the course of these studies of selective reductions, a minor anomaly resulted
in the discovery of hydroboration. My coworker, Dr. B. C. Subba Rao, was
examining the reducing characteristics of sodium borohydride in diglyme
catalyzed by aluminum chloride [17]. H e observed that the reduction of ethyl
oleate under our standard conditions, 4 moles of hydride per mole of compound,
one hour at       took up 2.37 equivalents of hydride per mole of ester. This
contrasted with a value of 2.00 for ethyl stearate. Investigation soon established

t h a t t h e r e a g e n t w a s a d d i n g a n H - B , bond to the carbon-carbon double

bond to form the corresponding organoborane[26].




(My parents were far-seeing in giving me the initials H. C. B.)
  Dr. Subba Rao established that oxidation of such organoboranes, in situ,
with alkaline hydrogen peroxide, proceeds quantitatively, producing alcohols
with the precise structure of the organoborane [26,27](14).




At this stage in the development, Dr. B. C. Subba Rao returned to India,
after spending live years with me. Fortunately, an equally competent and
productive coworker, Dr. George Zweifel, soon joined my group. Although


                                     H. C. Brown                               349


trained at the E. T. H. in Zurich as a carbohydrate chemist, he expressed a
deep interest in the possibilities of the hydroboration reaction and progress was
extraordinarily rapid[28]

The additon takes   place preferentially from the less hindered side of the double
bond (17).




 No rearrangements of the carbon skeleton have been observed, even in molecules
 as labile as α-pinene (18).




Most functional groups can tolerate hydroboration ( 19).




                                                                              (19)


 Now the organic chemist can conveniently synthesize reactive intermediates
 containing functional groups and utilize those intermediates to form products
 with new carbon-carbon bonds.
   Standardized procedures for hydroboration have been developed and are fully
 described as well as the utilization of the organoborane products for organic
 syntheses[29]. (To conserve space, references will be given only to developments
 which have appeared since the publication of this book.)

V. NEW HYDROBORATING AGENTS




H ow ever, in a number of ins tances it has been possible to control the
hydroboration to achieve the synthesis of monoalkylboranes, dialkylboranes,
and cyclic and bicyclic boranes (Fig. 5). Many of these reagents, such as
thexylborane[30], disiamylborane[31], dipinylborane[32], and 9-borabicyclo-
[3.3.1] nonane[33], have proven t o b e v a l u a b l e i n o v e r c o m i n g p r o b l e m s
encountered with the use of diborane itself.
   In a number of cases, hydroboration with heterosubstituted boranes has also
proven valuable. Research in this area was greatly facilitated by exceptional
co n tr ib u tio n s f r o m S . K . G u p ta, N . R av indran, and S. U. Kulkarni. For
example, c a t e c h o l b o r a n e [ 3 4 ] a n d t h e c h l o r o b o r a n e e t h e r a t e s [ 3 5 ] ( F i g . 6 )
permit the synthesis of boronic and borinic acid esters, as well as the
synthesis of the simple mono- and dialkylchloroboranes, RBCl 2 . and R 2 B C l .
The corresponding haloborane-dimethyl sulfides are stabler and easier to work
with[36] (Fig. 7).

  These reagents often exhibit marked advantages in hydroboration over
diborane itself. For example, disiamylborane yields far less of the minor isomer
in the hydroboration of terminal olefins than does diborane (21).




Disiamylborane also favors addition of the boron atom to the less substituted
position of a 1,2-dialkylethylene (22).

VI. THE VERSATILE ORGANOBORANES
At the time we were exploring the hydroboration reaction, many individuals
expressed skepticism to me as to the wisdom of devoting so much research
effort to this reaction. After all, hydroboration produced organoboranes. Rela-
tively little new chemistry of organoboranes had appeared since the original
classic publication by Frankland in 1862. They took the position that the
lack of published material in this area meant that there was little of value there.
   In this case it is now clear that this position is not correct. After our
exploration of the hydroboration reaction had proceeded to the place where
we felt we understood the reaction and could apply it with confidence to new
situations, we began a systematic exploration of the chemistry of organoboranes.
This research, facilitated by a host of exceptionally capable coworkers, among
whom may be mentioned M. M. Rogid, M. M. Midland, C. F. Lane, A. B. Levy,
R. C. Larock, and Y. Yamamoto, made it clear that the organoboranes are
among the most versatile chemical intermediates available to the chemist.
   It is not possible here to give more than a taste of the rich chemistry.
For a more complete treatment, the reader must go elsewhere [29,38].


                                     H. C. Brown                              353


   Simple treatment of the organoborane with halogen in the presence of a
suitable base produces the desired organic halide[39,40] (25, 26).



                                                                            (25)




                                                                            (26)




Oxidation with alkaline hydrogen peroxide produces the alcohol in essentially
quantitative yield with complete retention of configuration [41] (27).


                                                                            (27)



Either chloroamine or O-hydroxylaminesulfonic acid can be used to convert
organoboranes into the corresponding amines [42] (28).




                                                                             (28)




The reaction of organoboranes with organic azides proceeds sluggishly with
the more hindered organoboranes. Fortunately, this difficulty can be circum-
vented with the new hydroborating agents [43] (29).


                                                                             (29)


Other organometallics can be synthesized from the organoboranes[44] (30).




The organoboranes can also be utilized to form carbon-carbon bonds[29].
One procedure utilizes transmetallation to the silver derivative, followed by the
usual coupling reaction of such derivatives [45] (31).

Cyclopropanes are readily synthesized[46] (32).




It is possible to achieve the alpha-alkylation and -arylation of esters, ketones,
nitriles, etc.[47] (33, 34).


                                                                              (33)




α-Bromination provides still another route to achieve the synthesis of desired
carbon structures [48] (35).

By means of this reaction, it is possible to combine three sec-butyl groups   [49]
(36).




                                                                              (36)




VII. STITCHING AND RIVETING
The hydroboration reaction allows the chemist to unite to boron under excep-
tionally mild conditions either three different olefins (38), or to cyclize dienes
(39), or trienes (40).




                                                                              (38)




                                                                              (39)


356                                Chemistry 1979


Thus, hydroboration allows us to use borane and its derivatives to “stitch”
together with boron either the segments of individual molecules or the segments
of a relatively open complex structure.
   If we could replace boron by carbon, we would be in position to “rivet”
these temporary structures into the desired carbon structure.
   In fact, there are now three different procedures which can be used in this
way: carbonylation [51] (41), cyanidation [ 52] (42), and the DCME reaction[53]




                                                                            (41)




Consequently, stitching and riveting provides an elegant new procedure for
the synthesis of complex structures. Its versatility is indicated by the synthesis
of an exceptionally hindered tertiary alcohol [54] (44) and by the annelation
reaction[55] (Fig. 8).




                                                                            (44)

workers, among whom may be mentioned M. W. Rathke, Ei-ichi Negishi,
J.-J. Katz, and B. A. Carlson.




VIII. HYDROBORATION OF ACETYLENES
Early attempts to hydroborate acetylenes with diborane led to complex
mixtures[28]. Fortunately, the problem can be solved by use of borane
derivatives[32,33] (45, 46).

Dibromoborane-dimethyl sulfide[56] appears to be especially valuable for such
hydroboration of acetylenes[57]. T h e reaction readily stops at the mono-
hydroboration step and it exhibits a valuable sensitivity to steric effects[56] (47).




The different reagents exhibit very different selectivities toward double and
triple bonds[56,57]. Th us it is now possible to achieve the preferential hydro-
boration in an appropriate enyne of the double bond in the presence of the
triple bond[58] (48 or to hydroborate the triple bond selectively in the presence
of the double bond

IX. VINYL BORANES
The monohydroboration ofacetylenes makes the vinyl boranes readily available.
These reveal an exceptionally rich chemistry.
   For example, protonolysis proceeds readily and provides an excellent syn-
thesis of cis-alkenes of high purity [59] (50).

Oxidation produces the aldehyde or ketone [57](51).


                                                                            (51)




The halogenation can be controlled to yield the halide either with retention[60]
(52) or inversion (53) [61].




                                                                             (53)




Mercuration readily yields the corresponding mercurial with complete retention
of stereochemistry [62](54).


                                                                             (54)




Pappo and Collins adopted this approach in their prostaglandin synthesis [63].
   The ready conversion of these vinyl boranes into organomercurials suggested
an exploration of their conversion into the organocopper intermediates. The
research in this area was greatly facilitated by J. B. Campbell, Jr. Indeed,
treatment of the 9-BBN adduct with sodium methoxide and the CuBr SMe 2
complex at 0° gave the diene with complete retention of stereochemistry [64] (55).

Presumably the diene arises from a thermal decomposition of the vinyl copper
intermediate.
   At -15° the intermediate is sufficiently stable to be diverted along another
reaction path by reaction with relatively reactive organic halides[65] (56).




This gentle procedure for synthesizing vinyl copper intermediates can accom-
modate such functional groups as the acetoxy group utilized in the example
shown.
  Our research efforts in this area were greatly facilitated by exceptional
contributions by a number of coworkers, including James B. Campbell, Jr. and
Gary Molander.
  Although time does not permit a detailed review here, attention is called to
the elegant procedures developed by my former coworkers, George Zweifel and
Ei-ichi Negishi, and their associates, for the synthesis of cis- and trans-olefins,
and the synthesis of cis, cis-, cis, trans, and trans, trans-dienes [66].

X. PHEROMONES
Pheromones offer a promising new means for controlling insect populations
without the problems of some of the earlier methods[67]. The pheromones are
chemicals of relatively simple structure emitted by insects as a means of
communicating with other members of the same species. Typical examples
are shown in Fig. 9.
   Even though the structures are relatively simple, they must be very pure so
that procedures utilized for their synthesis possess unusually severe require-
ments for high regio- and stereospecificity. It appeared that synthetic procedures
based on organoborane chemistry should be especially favorable for this
objective. Accordingly, we have undertaken a new program directed toward
developing simple syntheses of such pheromones based upon organoborane
chemistry. This research program has been greatly facilitated by Gary A.
Molander and K. K. Wang.

Treatment of the ate complex with iodine at -78° provides the acetylene[69]

Hydroboration with 9-BBN, followed by protonolysis with methanol, gives the
desired product in an isolated yield of 75%, exhibiting a purity of > 98% (60).




It should be noted that the entire synthetic procedure can be carried out in a
single flask without isolation of any material until the final product.


IX. CONCLUSION
In this Nobel Lecture I elected to discuss the results of a research program
over the past 43 years on the chemistry of borane and its derivatives. This
was a deliberate choice. I felt that in this way I could transmit a valuable
message to my younger colleagues.
  In 1938, when I received my Ph. D. degree, I felt that organic chemistry
was a relatively mature science, with essentially all of the important reactions
and structures known. There appeared to be little new to be done except the
working out of reaction mechanisms and the improvement of reaction products.
I now recognize that I was wrong. I have seen major new reactions discovered.
Numerous new reagents are available to us. Many new structures are known
to us. We have at hand many valuable new techniques.
   I know that many of the students of today feel the same way that I did in
1938. But I see no reason for believing that the next 40 years will not be as
fruitful as in the past.
   In my book, H y d r o b o r a t i o n (ref. 28), I quoted the poet: “Tall oaks from
little acorns grow.“[70] B tu in this lecture I have started further back, to a

time when the acorn was a mere grain of pollen. I have shown how that grain of
pollen developed first into an acorn. Then the acorn became an oak. The oak
tree became a forest. Now we are beginning to see the outlines of a continent.
  We have been moving rapidly over that continent, scouting out the major
mountain ranges, river valleys, lakes, and coasts. But it is evident that we have
only scratched the surface. It will require another generation of chemists to
settle that continent and to utilize it for the good of mankind.
  But is there any reason to believe that this is the last continent of its kind?
Surely not. It is entirely possible that all around us lie similar continents
awaiting discovery by enthusiastic, optimistic explorers. I hope that one result
of this lecture will be to inspire young chemists to search for such new continents.
  Good luck!
