An image has Rotational Symmetry if there is a center point around
which the object is turned a certain number of degrees and the object
still looks the same, ie it matches itself a number of times while it is
being rotated.

                     Crystallography
Modern crystallography started in 1912 with the seminal work of
von Laue who performed the first x-ray diffraction experiment.

The crystals von Laue studied were ordered and periodic, and
all the hundreds of thousands crystals studied during the 70
years from 1912 till 1982 were found to be ordered and periodic.


Based on these observation, a paradigm was created that all crystals
are periodic and the following definitions of “crystal” was accepted
by the community of crystallographers and by the scientific community
in general.


                Crystal definition till 1991


A crystal may be defined as:

                        A solid composed of atoms
                        arranged in a pattern periodic
                        in three dimensions

                        Atoms in a crystal are arranged
                        in a pattern that repeats itself
                        in three dimensions throughout

  Atoms in diamond – periodic order




The order of carbon atoms in diamond is periodic.
The allowed rotational symmetries are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6.
5-fold rotational symmetry as well as any other symmetry
beyond 6 is forbidden in periodic structures.


    A diffraction pattern from a periodic
    crystal is characterized by:

♣ Periodicity of diffraction
peaks in the reciprocal
Space

♣ Rotational symmetries:
1,2,3,4 and 6-fold

♣ No 5-fold rotational
symmetry and nothing
beyond 6-fold


            A new definition for Crystal

    “…… By crystal we mean any solid having
   an essentially discrete diffraction diagram,
   and by aperiodic crystal we mean any
   crystal in which three dimensional lattice
   periodicity can be considered to be
   absent.”

                   Each twin diffracts like a
                  single crystal, but
                  superposition of all ten
                  patterns results in a
                  pseudo five fold
                  rotational symmetry.

                   particles in this grain,
                   They must be smaller
                   than the size of the
                   beam.

The Shechtman-Blech article
was rejected by JAP in
September 1984.

I then submitted it to
Met. Trans. on October 2,
1984. The article was
accepted and published in
June, 1985

The article includes the
crystallographic information
of the Icosahedral phase,
and a model that explains
the structure, including
simulations of the reciprocal
space of the model and
comparison of the
simulations with the
observed diffraction
patterns obtained from the
Icosahedral phase.


In September 1984 I gave the
Shechtman-Blech article to
John Cahn who was on his way
to Santa Barbara. Upon John’s
return we had a conversation
about the article and John
suggested to bring Denis Gratias
to NBS for discussion. Denis
came to NBS for several days and
the three of us composed a
focused article based on the
1982 TEM observations and
analysis.



A week or so later we sent the
article to Phys. Rev. Lett.
The article was received on
October 9 and published a month
later, on November 12, 1984

Professor Linus Pauling
The main objection to the
quasiperiodic nature of QCs
came from Professor Linus
Pauling
Linus Carl Pauling (February 28, 1901-
August 19, 1994), was a distinguished
American chemist, two time Nobel
Laureate.
During the last decade of his life he tried to prove
that QCs are really just twinned periodic crystals.
He did that by proposing larger ad larger periodic
unit cells. All his models were proven wrong.

At the end of his life he remained the only
prominent opponent to quasiperiodicity in crystals.


As large single QCs became available,
so did x-ray diffraction patterns.

It is this x-ray diffraction pattern that convinced the community
of crystallographers that 5-fold symmetry can exist in crystals.
This became available only in 1987.
Only electron diffraction patterns were taken before that time.

Why QCs were never discovered before 1982?



        ♣ Are they very rare?


              ♣ Are they not stable?


                      ♣ Are they difficult to make?


Are QCs rare?

QCs are not rare there are hundreds of them.


  Are QCs not stable?                              Al-Li-Cu

  Many are, and transform to                      Mg-Zn-Ga
  periodic structures at high
  temperatures, but QCs can                       Mg-Pd-Al
  be thermodynamically
  Stable. Examples are -
                                              Al-Cu-(Fe, Ru, Os)

                                               Al-Pd-(Mg, Re)

Most of these stable QCs were discovered by
                                                  Zn-Mg-RE
