INTRODUCTION
All living cells contain many thousands of different proteins, each of which
carries out a specific chemical or physical process. Due to the importance of
proteins in basic cellular functions, there has been a great interest in the
problem of how proteins are synthesized. In the fifties and sixties of the 20th
century, the discovery of the double helical structure of DNA and the cracking
of the genetic code focused attention on the mechanisms by which the order
of bases in DNA determines the sequence of amino acids in proteins, and on
further molecular mechanisms that regulate the expression of specific genes.
Because of the intensive research activity on protein synthesis, little attention
was paid to at that time to the fact that many proteins are rapidly degraded to
amino acids. This dynamic turnover of cellular proteins had been previously
known by the pioneering work of Schoenheimer and co-workers, who were
among the first to introduce the use of isotopically labeled compounds to
biological studies. They administered 15N-labeled L-leucine to adult rats, and
the distribution of the isotope in body tissues and in excreta was examined. It
was observed that less than one-third of the isotope was excreted in the urine,
and most of it was incorporated into tissue proteins (1). Since the weight of
the animals did not change during the experiment, it could be assumed that
the mass and composition of body proteins also did not change. It was con-
cluded that newly incorporated amino acids must have replaced those in tissue
proteins in a process of dynamic protein turnover (1). Schoenheimer’s studies
on the dynamic state of proteins and of some other body constituents were pu-
blished in a small booklet in 1942, soon after his untimely death (ref. 2, see
Fig. 1).
   In the subsequent decades research on protein degradation was neglected,
mainly because of the great interest in the mechanisms of protein synthesis, as
described above. However, gradually experimental evidence accumulated
which indicated that intracellular protein degradation is extensive, selective
and has basically important cellular functions. It was observed that abnormal

proteins produced by the incorporation of some amino acid analogues are
selectively recognized and are rapidly degraded in cells (3). However, intra-
cellular protein degradation was not thought to be merely a “garbage dispo-
sal” system for the elimination of abnormal or damaged proteins. By the late
sixties, it became apparent that normal proteins are also degraded in a highly
selective fashion. The half-life times of different proteins ranged from several
minutes to many days, and rapidly degraded proteins usually had important
regulatory functions. These properties of intracellular protein degradation
and the role of this process in the regulation of the levels of specific proteins
were summarized in an excellent review by Schimke and Doyle in 1970 (4).
Thus, it was known at that time that protein degradation has important func-
tions, but it was not known what is the biochemical system that carries out this
process at such a high degree of selectivity and sophistication.


MY FIRST ENCOUNTER WITH PROTEIN DEGRADATION
I became interested in the problem of how proteins are degraded in cells
when I was a post-doctoral fellow in the laboratory of Gordon Tomkins in
1969–71 at the University of California, San Francisco. At that time, Gordon
was mainly interested in the mechanisms by which steroid hormones induce
the synthesis of specific proteins. His model system for this purpose was the
synthesis of the enzyme tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) in cultured hepato-

ma cells. When I arrived there I saw that it was a large laboratory, with many
post-doctoral fellows working on different aspects of the synthesis of TAT. I
thought that this was a bit too crowded and I asked Gordon for a different
project. He suggested that I should study the degradation of TAT, a process
that also regulates the level of this enzyme. This was how I became involved in
protein degradation, a problem on which I have been working ever since.
   Fig. 2 shows one of the first experiments that I did as a post-doctoral
fellow in the Tomkins lab. It was quite easy to follow the degradation of TAT:
first, hepatoma cells were incubated with a steroid hormone, which caused a
great increase in the level of this protein. Then the hormone was removed by
changing the culture medium, and a rapid decline in the level of this protein,
due to its degradation, could be observed. As with other regulatory proteins,
this protein also had a relatively rapid rate of degradation, with a half-life time
of about 2-3 hours. I found then that the degradation of TAT was completely
arrested by potassium fluoride, an inhibitor of cellular energy production (ref.
5 and Fig. 2). The effect was not specific to fluoride, because I got similar results
with other inhibitors of cellular energy production. These results confirmed and
extended earlier findings of Simpson (6) on the energy-dependence of the
liberation of amino acids from proteins in liver slices. This observation was later
dismissed as being indirect, and that energy is needed to keep the acidic pH
inside the lysosomes (described in ref. 7). However, in the case of TAT energy
was needed for the selective degradation of a specific enzyme, and it did not

                                                                                    189


seem reasonable to assume that engulfment into lysosomes can be responsible
for the highly selective degradation of specific cellular proteins. Since ATP
depletion also prevented the inactivation of the enzymatic activity of TAT, it
was concluded that energy is required at an early step in the process of protein
degradation (5).
   I was very much intrigued by the energy-dependence of intracellular protein
degradation. Energy is usually needed to synthesize a chemical bond, and not
to break a chemical bond. Thus, the action of extracellular proteinases of the
digestive system is an exergonic process, i. e., it actually releases energy. This
suggested that within cells a novel, as yet unknown proteolytic system exists,
that presumably uses energy to attain the high selectivity of the degradation of
cellular proteins.


DISCOVERY OF THE ROLE OF UBIQUITIN IN PROTEIN DEGRADATION
Parts of the story of the discovery of the ubiquitin system have been described
previously (7–9). Following my return to Israel and setting up my own labora-
tory at the Technion in Haifa, I continued to pursue this problem of how pro-
teins are degraded in cells, and why is energy required for this process. It was
clear to me that the only way to find out how a completely novel system works
is that of classical biochemistry. This consists of using a cell-free system that
faithfully reproduces the process in the test tube, fractionation to separate its
different components, purification and characterization of each component
and reconstitution of the system from isolated and purified components. A
cell-free ATP-dependent proteolytic system from reticulocyte lysates was first
established by Etlinger and Goldberg (10). Subsequently, my laboratory sub-
jected this system to biochemical fractionation, with the aim of the isolation of
its components and the characterization of their mode of action. A great part
of this work was done by Aaron Ciechanover, who was my graduate student at
that time (1976–1981). This work has also received a lot of support, great ad-
vice and helpful criticism from Irwin Rose, in whose laboratory at Fox Chase
Cancer Center I worked in a sabbatical year in 1977–78 and in many summers
afterwards.
    In the initial experiments, we have resolved reticulocyte lysates on DEAE-
cellulose into two crude fractions: Fraction 1, which contained proteins not
adsorbed to the resin, and Fraction 2, which contained all proteins adsorbed
to the resin and eluted with high salt. The original aim of this fractionation
was to get rid of hemoglobin, which was known to be in Fraction 1, while most
non-hemoglobin proteins of reticulocytes were known to be in Fraction 2. We
found that neither fraction was active by itself, but ATP-dependent protein
degradation could be reconstituted by the combination of the two fractions
(11). The active component in Fraction 1 was a small, heat stable protein; we
have exploited its stability to heat treatment for its purification to near homo-
geneity. We termed this protein at that time APF-1, for ATP-dependent
Proteolysis Factor 1. The identity of APF-1 with ubiquitin was established later
by Wilkinson et al. (12), subsequent to our discovery of its covalent ligation to

protein substrates, as described below. Ubiquitin was originally isolated by
Goldstein and co-workers in a search for hormones of the thymus, but was sub-
sequently found to be present in all tissues and eukaryotic organisms, hence
its name (13). The functions of ubiquitin were not known, though it was dis-
covered by Goldknopf and Busch that ubiquitin was conjugated to histone 2A
by an isopeptide linkage (14).
    The purification of APF-1/ubiquitin from Fraction 1 was the key to the elu-
cidation of the mode of its action in the proteolytic system. It looked smaller
than most enzymes, so at first we thought that it might be a regulatory subunit
of some enzyme (such as a protein kinase or an ATP-dependent protease) pre-
sent in Faction 2. To test this notion, we looked for the association of APF-
1/ubiquitin with some protein in Fraction 2. For this purpose, purified radio-
labeled APF-1/ubiquitin was incubated with Fraction 2 in the presence or
absence of ATP, and was subjected to gel filtration chromatography. A marked
ATP-dependent association of APF-1/ubiquitin with high molecular weight
material was observed (15). It was very surprising to find, however, that ubiquitin
was bound by covalent amide linkage, as indicated by the resistance of high
molecular weight derivative to alkali, hydroxylamine and boiling with SDS in
the presence of mercaptoethanol (15). The analysis of reaction products by
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that ubiquitin was ligated to a
great number of endogenous proteins. Since crude Fraction 2 from reticulo-

cytes contained not only enzymes, but also endogenous substrates of the
proteolytic system, we began to suspect that ubiquitin may be linked to protein
substrates, rather than to an enzyme. We indeed found that proteins that are
good (though artificial) substrates of the ATP-dependent proteolytic system,
such as lysozyme, are conjugated to ubiquitin (16). The original experiment is
shown in Fig. 3. We found that similar high-molecular weight derivatives were
formed when 125I-labeled ubiquitin was incubated with unlabeled lysozyme

(Fig. 3, lanes 3–5), or when 125I-labeled lysozyme was incubated with unlabeled
ubiquitin in the presence of ATP (Fig. 3, lane 7). Based on these observations,
we proposed that proteins are targeted for degradation by covalent ligation to
APF-1/ubiquitin (16). The original hypothesis from 1980, formulated jointly
with Irwin Rose, is shown in Fig. 4A. We proposed that a putative enzyme,
which we called “APF-1-protein amide synthetase”, ligates multiple molecules
of ubiquitin to the protein substrate (Step 1) and then some other enzyme
degrades proteins which are linked to several molecules of ubiquitin (Step 3),
and finally free and reutilizable ubiquitin is released (Step 4). According to
this proposal, ubiquitin is essentially a tag, which when attached to a protein,
dooms this protein to be degraded.

IDENTIFICATION OF ENZYMES OF THE UBIQUITIN-MEDIATED PRO-
TEOLYTIC SYSTEM
In subsequent work, we tried to isolate and characterize enzymes of the
ubiquitin pathway, using the same biochemical fractionation-reconstitution
approach. The original proposal (Fig. 4A) was found to be essentially correct,
but much important detail was added. Our present knowledge of the main
enzymatic steps in the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway is shown in
Fig. 4B (reviewed in ref. 17). This scheme summarizes about 10 years of our
work (from 1980 to 1990), as well as that of some other researchers. Thus, we
found that ubiquitin is ligated to proteins not by one enzyme, but by the
sequential action of three enzymes. These are the ubiquitin-activating enzyme
E1 (18), a ubiquitin-carrier protein E2 (19) and a ubiquitin-protein ligase E3
(19). E1 carries out the ATP-dependent activation of the carboxy-terminal
glycine residue of ubiquitin (20) by the formation of ubiquitin adenylate, follo-
wed by the transfer of activated ubiquitin to a thiol site of E1 with the formation
of thiolester linkage (18, 21). Activated ubiquitin is transferred to a thiol site
of E2 by transacylation, and is then further transferred to amino group of the
protein substrate in a reaction that requires E3 (19). We found that the role
of E3 is to bind specific protein substrates (22). Based on this observation, it
was proposed that the selectivity of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation is
mainly determined by the substrate specificity of different E3 enzymes (23).
This notion was verified by subsequent work in many laboratories on the
selective action of a large number of different E3 enzymes on their specific
protein substrates. Proteins ligated to polyubiquitin chains are degraded by a
large 26S proteasome complex (discovered by other investigators) and free
ubiquitin is released by the action of ubiquitin-C-terminal hydrolases or
isopeptidases (reviewed in 17).

MECHANISMS OF THE DEGRADATION OF CYCLIN B: DISCOVERY OF
THE CYCLOSOME/ANAPHASE-PROMOTING COMPLEX
All our studies on the basic biochemistry of the ubiquitin pathway were carried
out in the reticulocyte system, using artificial model protein substrates.
Though many gaps remained in our understanding of the basic biochemical

processes of the ubiquitin system, at around 1990 I thought that it was important
to turn to the question of how is the degradation of specific cellular proteins
is carried out by the ubiquitin system in a selective and regulated fashion. This is
how I became interested in the roles of the ubiquitin system in the cell division
cycle, because the levels of many cell cycle regulatory proteins oscillate in the
cell cycle. I first worked on the biochemical mechanisms of the degradation of
cyclin B in the early embryonic cell cycle. Cyclin B was discovered by Hunt and
co-workers as a protein that is degraded at the end of each mitosis (24). It was
subsequently found that it is a positive regulatory subunit of protein kinase
Cdc2/Cdk1 (Cyclin-dependent kinase 1) (reviewed in ref. 25). In the early
embryonic cell cycles, cyclin B is synthesized during the interphase and then is
rapidly degraded in the metaphase-anaphase transition. The active protein
kinase Cdk1-cyclin B (also called MPF or M phase-promoting factor) is formed
at the beginning of mitosis and promotes entry of cells into mitosis. The inac-
tivation of MPF, caused by the degradation of cyclin B, is required for exit
from mitosis. Our question was: what is the system that degrades cyclin B and
why does it act only at the end of mitosis?
    I have approached this problem again by biochemistry, and here the quest
for a cell-free system led me to marine biology and to the surf clam, Spisula
solidissima (Fig. 5). This is a large clam that produces large numbers of oocytes.
Luca and Ruderman (26) established a cell-free system from fertilized clam

194


oocytes that faithfully reproduced cell cycle stage-specific degradation of
mitotic cyclins. In this work, I was greatly helped first by Robert Palazzo and
Leonard Cohen, and then by collaboration with Joan Ruderman. Initial fractio-
nation of the system (27) showed that in addition to E1, two novel components
were required for the ligation of cyclin B to ubiquitin: these were a specific E2
called E2-C and an E3-like activity, which in clam extracts, was associated with
particulate material. We have solubilized the E3-like activity and found it to be
a large (~1,500 kDa) complex that has ubiquitin ligase activity on mitotic
cyclins. The activity of this enzyme is regulated in the cell cycle: it is inactive in
the interphase and becomes active at the end of mitosis, an event that requires
the action of Cdk1/cyclin B (28). We called this ubiquitin ligase complex the
cyclosome, to denote its large size and important roles in cell cycle regulation
(28). A similar complex was isolated at about the same time from extracts of
Xenopus eggs by the Kirschner laboratory and was called the Anaphase-
Promoting Complex (29). Parallel genetic work in yeast by the Nasmyth group
identified several subunits of the Anaphase-Promoting Complex/cyclosome
(or APC/C, as it is now called) as products of genes required for exit from
mitosis (30). Thus, the discovery of APC/C was due to the convergence of
biochemical with genetic work. Subsequent work by other investigators showed
that the APC/C is also involved in the degradation of several other important
cell cycle regulators, such as securin, an inhibitor of anaphase onset (reviewed
in 31, 32). In addition, the APC/C is the target of the spindle assembly check-
point system, an important surveillance mechanism that allows the separation
of sister chromatids only after they are all properly attached to the mitotic
spindle (reviewed in 33).


ROLE OF SCFSKP2 UBIQUITIN LIGASE IN THE DEGRADATION OF THE
CDK INHIBITOR P27KIP1
Another problem on which I have been working recently, in collaboration
with Michele Pagano, is on the mode of the degradation of the mammalian
Cdk inhibitor p27Kip1. This inhibitor is present at high levels in G0/G1,
preventing the action of Cdk2/cyclin E and Cdk2/cyclin A to drive cells into
the S-phase. Following growth stimulation by mitogenic agents p27 is rapidly
degraded, allowing the action of these kinases to promote entry into the
S-phase (reviewed in 34). It has been shown that p27 is degraded by the
ubiquitin system (35). We have tried to identify the ubiquitin ligase system
that targets p27 for degradation. It was first found that the process of p27-ubi-
quitin ligation can be faithfully reproduced in vitro in extracts of HeLa cells.
Thus, the rate of ligation of p27 to ubiquitin was much greater in extracts
from growing cells than in extracts from G1-arrested cells. It was also found
that the phosphorylation of p27 on T187 by Cdk2/cyclin E is required for
p27-ubiquitin ligation in vitro (36), as is the case in vivo (37). Having established
that the cell-free system accurately reflects the characteristics of p27 ubiqui-
tylation in cells, we then proceeded to utilize this cell-free system to identify
the ubiquitin ligase (E3 enzyme) involved in this process. Because of the

                                                                                 195


requirement for the phosphorylation of the p27 substrate, we suspected that
an SCF (Skp1-Cullin1-F-box protein) type ubiquitin ligase might be involved.
SCF complexes comprise a large family of ubiquitin-protein ligases, whose
variable F-box protein subunits recognize a variety of phosphorylated protein
substrates (reviewed in 38). We have identified Skp2 (S-phase kinase-associated
protein 2) as the specific F-box protein component of an SCF complex
that ubiquitylates p27, based on the following biochemical evidence: (a)
Immunodepletion of extracts from proliferating cells with an antibody directed
against Skp2 abolished p27-ubiquitin ligation activity; (b) Addition of recom-
binant, purified Skp2 to such immunodepleted extracts completely restored
p27-ubiquitin ligation; (c) Specific binding of p27 to Skp2, dependent upon
phosphorylation of p27 on T187, could be demonstrated in vitro. Combined
with further in vivo evidence from the Pagano lab, Skp2 was identified as the
specific and rate-limiting component of an SCF complex that targets p27 for
degradation (39). It is notable that levels of Skp2 also oscillate in the cell cycle,
being very low in G1, increasing upon entry of cells into the S-phase and
declining again later on (40). These fluctuations in Skp2 levels provide an
important mechanism for cell cycle stage-specific regulation of p27 degradation.
   We have next tried to reconstitute the SCFSkp2 system that ligates p27 to ubi-
quitin from purified components. We found that in addition to the known
components (Cullin 1, Skp1, Skp2, Roc1, Cdk2/cyclin E, E1 and the E2 enzyme
Cdc34), an additional protein factor is required for this reaction. We have
purified the missing factor from extracts of HeLa cells and have identified it as
Cks1 (cyclin kinase subunit 1), both by mass spectrometry sequencing and by
functional reconstitution with recombinant Cks1 protein (41). Cks1 belongs
to the highly conserved Suc1/Cks family of proteins, which bind to some cyclin-
dependent kinases and to phosphorylated proteins, and are essential for several
cell cycle transitions (42). Human Cks1, but not other members of this protein
family, reconstituted p27-ubiquitin ligation in a completely purified system.
While all members of the Suc1/Cks protein family have Cdk-binding and anion-
binding sites, only mammalian Cks1 binds to Skp2 and promotes the associa-
tion of Skp2 with p27 phosphorylated on T187 (41). Similar results were
independently obtained by another research group (43). More recently, we
have mapped the Skp2-binding site of Cks1 by site-directed mutagenesis and
found that it is located on a region that includes the 2 and 1 helices, well
separated from the other two binding sites of Cks1. All three binding sites of
Cks1 are required for its action to promote p27-ubiquitin ligation and for the
association of Skp2 with T-187-phosphorylated p27 (44). Based on these and
on further observations, a model was proposed according to which Cks1 serves
as an adaptor necessary for enzyme-substrate interaction: the Skp2-Cks1 com-
plex binds to phosphorylated p27, a process which requires the anion-binding
site of Cks1. The affinity of Skp2 to the substrate is then further strengthened
by the association of the Cdk-binding site of Cks1 with Cdk2/cyclin E, to which
phosphorylated p27 is tightly bound (44). It is notable that the expression
of Cks1 also oscillates in the cell cycle (45, 46), providing an additional
mechanism for the regulation of p27 degradation.

CONCLUDING REMARKS
The ubiquitin system has come a long way since its humble beginnings described
in this paper. Ubiquitin-mediated degradation of positively or negatively acting
regulatory proteins is involved in a variety of cellular processes such as the control
of cell division, signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, immune and
inflammatory responses, embryonic development, apoptosis and circadian
clocks, to mention but a few. The involvement of malfunction of ubiquitin-
mediated processes in diseases such as certain cancers, and the therapeutic im-
plications of this knowledge, are also beginning to emerge. I am quite certain
that we are still seeing only the tip of the iceberg of the multitude of functions
of the ubiquitin system in health and disease. The main lesson from the story
of the discovery of the ubiquitin system that I would like to convey, mainly to
young researchers, is the continued importance of biochemistry in modern
biomedical research. In his book “For the Love of Enzymes”, Arthur Kornberg
divided the history of biomedical research into four main periods. First were
the “microbe hunters”, the great microbiologists of the 19th century. They
were followed by the “vitamin hunters”, the discoverers of the vitamins. Next
were the “enzyme hunters” – the biochemists, followed by the “gene hunters”
– the molecular geneticists. However, the times of enzyme (or protein) hunting
are far from being over. With the completion of the human genome project, all
genes have been “hunted”, but we know the functions of only about one-third
of our genes. If we want to know what are the roles of the rest of our genes in
health and in disease, we shall have to continue to use biochemistry, in com-
bination with functional genetics, well into the future. Our story shows that
the ubiquitin system could not have been discovered without biochemical
approaches. We could not have a clue to the ubiquitin tagging mechanisms by
genetics alone, or by the sequence of genes of the ubiquitin system. On the other
hand, once the basic biochemistry was known, molecular genetic approaches
were essential for the discovery of the multitude of functions of the ubiquitin
proteolytic pathway. So my advice to young investigators in biomedical sciences
is: if you have a problem that cannot be solved by molecular genetics alone, do
not be afraid to use biochemistry, do not hesitate to enter the cold room, and
do not be wary of approaching the FPLC machine!

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
In experimental sciences, including biochemistry, discoveries are not made by
a single person, but require the assistance of dedicated research teams and the
help of friends, colleagues and collaborators. In my laboratory at the Technion,
Haifa, I was very fortunate to receive devoted help, at different times over
a period of more than 30 years, from Dvora Ganoth, Hanna Heller, Esther
Eytan, Sarah Elias, Clara Segal and from my wife, Judith Hershko. Among
my former graduate students, Aaron Ciechanover did tremendous work in the
exciting times of the discovery of ubiquitin-protein ligation 25 years ago.
Subsequently, many other graduate students (too many to list here) did
very important work on the basic biochemistry of the ubiquitin system and

more recently, on some roles of this system in cell cycle control. Out of my
several friends-collaborators, mentioned in this paper, Irwin Rose had a very
special role. My association with Ernie started with a sabbatical year in his
laboratory in Fox Chase Cancer Center, Philadelphia, in 1977–78 (see also
accompanying biography). During this year, I continued to work on the initial
fractionation of the reticulocyte system and the purification of ubiquitin,
which we started in Haifa. In the following summer of 1979, Ernie invited me
back to his laboratory, together with my graduate student Aaron Ciechanover
and research assistant Hanna Heller. When we got there we already knew,
from work done in the Haifa lab, that ubiquitin becomes bound to proteins in
an ATP-dependent process. However, the discovery that a covalent amide
bond is formed between ubiquitin and the substrate protein was made together
with Ernie Rose in that summer in Philadelphia. A group picture, taken at the
end of this memorable summer of 1979 at Fox Chase Center, included the
people involved (Fig. 6). The results of this summer’s work were reported in
ref. 16.
