INTRODUCTION
When I was a student at university, my major field of study was Electrical
Engineering. I did not specialize in chemistry in my studies at university, and
my knowledge of chemistry overall was somewhat less than rich. Under those
circumstances, upon entering the company, I applied myself wholeheartedly
to the study of chemistry to challenge and overcome a barrier in analytical
chemistry considered to be impenetrable. I am, of course, very pleased to re-
ceive the Nobel Prize and further, especially pleased that the Prize serves to
acknowledge my efforts and successes in the field of analytical chemistry, a
field that while rather inconspicuous among the general population is indeed
very important and useful to the world.
   I am employed by the analytical instrument manufacturer, Shimadzu
Corporation. I was assigned to a team charged with the task of designing and
building a completely new mass spectrometer. The achievement of develop-
ing ‚Äúa soft desorption ionization method for mass spectrometric analysis of
biological macromolecules‚Äù, for which I was chosen to receive this prize, was
one aspect of that project. At that period in the 1980‚Äôs, four of my colleagues,
whom I will introduce shortly, in addition to myself, were each in charge of
developing a part of the instrument. I was responsible for developing the
sample preparation and ionization technologies. Success of the instrument
would not have been assured unless the other technologies were suitably pro-
vided, even given the excellence of the ionization technology. First, I will
briefly describe the progress of development of the technologies at that time,
other than that of ionization.


MASS SEPARATION: TOF TECHNOLOGY
In mass spectrometry, it is necessary to use some method to separate the gen-
erated ions according to mass, and then perform detection of the ions. One
of these methods is called Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (TOF-MS), which
involves separating ions according to mass by measuring their respective
flight times.

  Figure 1 provides the simplest representation of the principle behind TOF-
MS. This assumes that equally charged ions of differing mass, M1, M2 and M3
are generated instantly at the same time and starting position. Assume that
M1 is the lightest of the ions. The ions are generated at an electrical potential

V0, and have a potential energy of zV0, where z is the charge of the ion. If all
of the potential energy is converted to kinetic energy, the velocity v is ex-
pressed by Equation (1), based on the law of conservation of energy. In other
words, the lighter ion travels at a higher speed, reaching the detector first.
  This explanation is based on ideal conditions (Equation (2)). Since the ions
actually possess a distribution of initial velocities, that is, initial kinetic energy ,
their arrival time t at the detector will show some distribution, even among
ions of equal mass (Equation (2)). This results in diminished mass resolution.


REFLECTRON TECHNOLOGY
To improve the resolution, it would be best if ions of the same mass and
charge arrive at the detector at the same time, even if their initial kinetic en-
ergies are different. Specifically, a device referred to as a Reflectron, first de-
scribed by Boris Mamyrin[1] in 1973, is used to reflect the ions midway in their
flight back toward the detector. This turning back of the ions has the effect of
adjusting the flight times of the ions in conjunction with their initial kinetic
energies, to ensure that ions of the same mass and charge reach the detector
at the same time (Figure 2).
   The isochronism of the pendulum is very well known. Stated simply, even if
the swing amplitude of the pendulum varies, the cycle times remain equal as
long as the cord length of the pendulum and the force of gravity stay the
same. Applying this principle, an ideal Reflectron was developed. In this case,
the cord length corresponds to the ion mass, the swing amplitude to the ini-
tial kinetic and potential energy, and the cycle time to the time of flight, re-

spectively. One method of this Reflectron technology was developed by one
of my colleagues at that time, Mr. Yoshikazu Yoshida (Patent number:
US4625112 issued in 1986) (Figure 3).


TIME DELAYED ION EXTRACTION
The principle behind TOF-MS assumes that ions are generated instantan-
eously, that is, in an infinitely short generation time. The time width of a laser
pulse is extremely small, in the order of a few nanoseconds in the case of the
N2 laser. However, when the laser intensity is high enough to greatly exceed
the ion generation threshold, as shown in Figure 4, ions may continue to be
generated even after the completion of laser irradiation. In the TOF model,
the mass resolution decreases due to the wider time width of ion generation.
   One of my colleagues at that time, Dr. Tamio Yoshida, succeeded in im-
proving the mass resolution, as shown in Figure 5, by drawing out the time
from ion generation to ion extraction. This is accomplished by maintaining
equivalent voltages at the sample plate and the grid to prevent the ions from
being extracted until they are all generated, and then by creating a potential

difference after tD to cause extraction of all the ions at the same time (filed in
Japan Patent Office [S60035097] in 1985). This method is the same in prin-
ciple as the time-lag focusing method which was originally designed by William
Wiley and Ian McLaren[2] to reduce the effect of initial spatial and kinetic en-
ergy distributions, but was now applied specifically to minimize the effect of
the prolonged laser-induced ion generation time.
   In addition, there is a heightened possibility that particles given a charge,

for example, protons and cations, will collide and react with normally neut-
ral, that is, uncharged sample molecules. Such processes are generally re-
ferred to as chemical ionization, as originally described by Burnaby Munson
and Frank Field.[3] The quantity of molecular ions ([M+Na]+ in Figure 6) can
be expected to increase.


ION DETECTION TECHNOLOGY
The term ‚Äúdetector‚Äù here refers to the conversion of ions separated by the
mass separation mechanism into a flow of electrons, in other words, an elec-
trical signal. The maximum mass number of ions that had been detected in
the early 1980‚Äôs was in the range of several thousand. In principle, the greater
the molecular weight (M.W.) of the ion, the slower the velocity, so the ion-to-
electron conversion efficiency could even drop to zero.
   The simplest method of raising sensitivity is to accelerate the ions even fur-
ther after mass separation occurs (this is called post acceleration). As shown in
Figure 7, the higher the post acceleration voltage, the greater the intensity of
the ions, and further, the higher the mass number, the greater will be the ef-
fect, especially when a high voltage is applied. Another method is the ion-to-

electron conversion method. As shown in Figure 8, the intensity increases
using this method as well.
   One of my colleagues at that time, Mr. Yutaka Ido, developed a detector
(Figure 9) that obtained the effects of both of these methods, enabling suffi-
ciently sensitive detection even when ions of especially high molecular weight
were generated.

MEASUREMENT TECHNOLOGY
ADC method
Even with improved detector sensitivity, it can be assumed that the intensity of
macromolecular ions would be weak. In particular, when performing a single,
one-shot measurement using a minute quantity of sample, successful quanti-
tative analysis may not be possible without a high enough signal-to-noise
(S/N) ratio. For this reason, a spectrum accumulation circuit is considered to
be indispensable. To satisfy the demand for an instrument capable of high-
speed measurement, a TOF spectrum measurement accumulation circuit was
developed within our group.
   One of my colleagues at that time, Mr. Satoshi Akita, developed an analog-
to-digital converter (ADC) circuit adopting a pipeline technique to achieve the
required speedup in measurement. The newly developed ADC circuit pro-
vided a maximum 1 kHz processing speed with real-time accumulation mea-
surement at a maximum time resolution of 10 nsec and 24 bit intensity reso-
lution (Figure 10).
   Moreover, to enable measurement of both low mass high intensity ions as
well as high mass low intensity ions, an amplifier that could perform gain
switching within one microsecond was developed and adopted to provide a
wider dynamic range.

TDC Method
At that time, ADC circuits had a time resolution of 10 nsec. It was our opinion
that even this resolution would not be enough. Mr. Yoshikazu Yoshida devel-

oped a time-to-digital converter (TDC) circuit that could measure with great
accuracy the flight time of the ions while measuring a maximum of 255 events
after one start signal (Multi-Stop-TDC), even though peak intensity informa-
tion was sacrificed. As a result, we were able to measure the time of flight at a
maximum time resolution of 1 nsec (Figure 10).
   All of these crucial developments further emphasize the certainty that if
even one of our group of five were not there, we would not have been able to
achieve measurement of macromolecular ions. I am truly happy that the tech-
nologies we developed in the 1980‚Äôs have been improved through their use in
various instruments, and that they have played a role in bringing TOF tech-
nology into the mainstream of MS from the 1990‚Äôs.


IONIZATION TECHNOLOGY
Long before the 1980‚Äôs, there had been investigation into the use of optical
energy, not limited to laser light, to achieve ionization of organic com-
pounds.[4] However, for the most part, this ionization consisted of stripping
electrons from compounds in the gas phase.[5] Because this was limited to
compounds that could be vaporized without being decomposed, very few
compounds could be ionized. When a solid phase organic compound was ir-
radiated with a laser, the organic compound absorbed the laser light, provid-
ing enough energy for desorption. Further, when the positive and negative
charges of the particle are not in balance, it could be measured as an ion.
However, in this case, since the laser light is absorbed directly into the analyte,

                                                                               205

the molecular bonds may be broken due to the increased internal energy. In
other words, there is an increased risk that measurement would occur in the
decomposed state (Figure 11). Because we wanted to measure the un-de-
composed, intact molecular ion, this was unsatisfactory.
   At that time, the molecular weight of compounds that could be ionized by
laser was about 1,000 Da, and ionization of compounds having a molecular
weight exceeding 10,000 Da was generally considered by chemists at the time
to be impossible. However, not being a specialist in chemistry, I was unaware
of the existence of this widely-held belief.


RAPID HEATING TECHNOLOGY
In the 1980‚Äôs, ‚Äúdesorption to gas phase by rapid heating‚Äù gained attention
through the efforts of several groups that had obtained some degree of en-
couraging results. These include Franz R√∂llgen[6, 7] of Germany, Mamoru
Ohashi[8] of Japan, and Louis Friedman[9], Don Hunt[10], Burnaby
Munson[11] and Robert Cotter[12] of the USA. A simple description of the
principle is depicted in Figure 12. In short, if a given compound ‚ÄúAB‚Äù is
heated, it is assumed that ‚ÄúAB‚Äù will be released to the gas phase as intact ‚ÄúAB‚Äù
as well as fragmented ‚ÄúA‚Äù and ‚ÄúB‚Äù. Respectively applying the well-known
Arrhenius Equation (Equation (3)) will give the logarithmic expressions
shown in Equation (4).
   Here, for compounds that are thermally labile and decompose easily, the
rate constant for decomposition ‚ÄúKD‚Äù is larger than that for vaporization ‚ÄúKV‚Äù
at low temperatures. Because the activation energy for vaporization ‚ÄúEV‚Äù is
higher than that for decomposition ‚ÄúED‚Äù, the slope of the vaporization reac-
tion ‚ÄúKV‚Äù in Figure 12 is steeper than that of the decomposition reaction.
   If this is always correct, at high temperature, where 1/T is small, vaporiza-
tion should be further promoted. In other words, reaching the highest pos-
sible temperature as quickly as possible should provide a high degree of va-
porization.

206


USE OF UFMP
To perform this rapid heating, various heating methods were devised.[9]
However, a high enough temperature could not be achieved quickly enough
to obtain intact vaporization of macromolecules, such as proteins. Since the
time width of a pulse laser itself is between a nanosecond to several microsec-
onds, rapid heating would seem possible using a focused beam to generate
energy at high density and high speed. However, this would require a me-
dium to enable its conversion into thermal energy.
   In Japan at that time in the 1980‚Äôs, Ultra Fine Metal Powder (UFMP) received
much attention in the field of metallurgy due to its usefulness in efficient pro-
duction of alloys, and was referred to as Japanese Powder. UFMP, as its name in-
dicates, is an extremely fine metallic powder with particle diameters meas-
uring a few tens of nanometers. When compared to bulk metal, the particle
diameter of UFMP is about the same as a wavelength, increasing the possibil-
ity that scattered light could be taken up internally (Figure 13). In other
words, light energy could be absorbed more efficiently. Even visually, it is
black in color. Moreover, the possibility that thermal energy would be dis-
persed and lost decreases due to the inter-particle spaces.

   Mixing this with an organic compound should allow the laser light to be ef-
ficiently absorbed into the UFMP, and to achieve a high UFMP temperature
very quickly without the dispersion and loss of heat. This would efficiently
achieve heating of the sample in the mixture. It was Mr. Yoshikazu Yoshida
who proposed using UFMP as a matrix* (Figure 14) (filed in 1985, Patent
number: JP01731501 issued in 1993).
   There was at that time an interest in using laser desorption for the analysis
of polymers, such as in the reports by Charles Wilkins[13] of the USA. The MS
spectrum shown in the upper part of Figure 15 is obtained when the sample,
consisting of a polymer mixture of polyethylene glycols (PEG), is irradiated
with a laser. The lower spectrum of Figure 15 shows that of the sample mixed
with UFMP. With PEG alone, fragment ion peaks of the PEG molecule are
dominant, and no PEG2000 peaks are observed. On the other hand, not on-

ly are there almost no fragment peaks observed when PEG is mixed with
UFMP, PEG2000 peaks have become clearly evident.
   With the use of this matrix, the molecular ions from many organic com-
pounds that could not be measured previously could then be measured.
However, this technique could not be applied to compounds with molecular
weights in the tens of thousands according to our experimental results.


GLYCERIN MATRIX TECHNOLOGY
At that time in the 1980‚Äôs, the Fast Atom Bombardment (FAB) MS method was
widely used to achieve ionization in thermally labile compounds. The FAB
method was developed by Michael Barber and colleagues[14], and David

                                                                            209


Surman and John Vickerman[15] of the UK, and involved accelerating neutral
particles such as Xenon at high speed so as to collide with the sample and
generate ions. In this method, the solid sample was maintained in a liquid
state by using glycerin (glycerol) as a matrix (Figure 16).
   It is thought that since glycerin is a liquid at room temperature, it releases
the solid sample from its crystalline state to dissolve in the liquid, thereby as-
sisting ionization. We used glycerin as a matrix just as it was used in FAB, but
because the 337 nm laser wavelength that we used was only slightly absorbed
into the glycerin, no significant effect was seen on the enhancement of mole-
cular ion generation in organic compounds. However, this matrix was useful
in improving reproducibility due to its effectiveness in providing a uniform
mixture.


UFMP GLYCERIN MIXTURE TECHNOLOGY
Here it can be said that I had come up against a brick wall. Soon after that,
while preparing many trial and error UFMP suspensions, changing the or-
ganic solvent and concentration repeatedly to obtain even the slightest im-
provement in data, I committed a monumental blunder, which was followed
by a series of fortuitous, arbitrary decisions. I was using ordinary acetone as a
UFMP suspension, and one day, by mistake, (1) I used the glycerin instead of
the acetone. Reasoning that it would be wasteful to discard the expensive
UFMP, (2) I decided to use the ‚Äúruined‚Äù preparation as the matrix solution.
Because glycerin gradually evaporates in a vacuum, I knew it would eventu-
ally disappear. However, instead of waiting, (3) I decided to speed up vapor-
ization of the glycerine by continuing to irradiate the laser. On top of that, be-
cause I wanted to see the result as soon as possible, (4) I was monitoring the
acquisition of the TOF spectrum. In this way, only after at least four factors
fell into place could I observe a phenomenon never before seen.
   I think that the sample first measured was Vitamin B12. I have tried recent-
ly to locate the original spectrum, but unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt find it.
Because this sample itself can absorb laser light with an extremely high de-
gree of efficiency, up to then, only the fragments could be measured with
high sensitivity. However, by using the mixed UFMP glycerin matrix, at the
position where unfragmented ions (molecular ions) should have appeared,
peaks which seemed to be noise were observed. No matter how many times I
performed the measurement, these peaks were present. Molecular ions were
observed even after changing the sample.
   After that, as a result of progressing to higher mass ions while optimizing
the concentration, laser power and other parameters, I was able to measure
an ion having a molecular weight of 35,000 Da (Figure 17) (1985) and an-
other ion having a mass number exceeding 100,000 (Figure 18) (1987). The
patent application for this ionization method was submitted in Japan in 1985,
and was subsequently issued in 1993 (Patent number: JP01769145).

WHY DID THE MACROMOLECULE BECOME IONIZED WITHOUT
DECOMPOSING?
Use of UFMP conveniently allows high temperatures to be reached at high
speed. However, even if this is mixed with a typical organic compound, it is
difficult to achieve sufficient mixing. Even when viewing the mixture in an
electron microscope-generated photograph, the lack of uniformity is obvious
(Figure 19, top). When glycerin is added to the mixture, however, the unifor-
mity becomes evident (Figure 19, bottom). Moreover, glycerin may also serve
to release the sample from its crystalline state. The ability to measure mole-

cular ions from organic compounds even exceeding a molecular weight of
10,000 Da may indeed be due to these effects (Figure 20).
   Here I have suggested the principles by which laser light irradiation is able
to generate huge molecular ions. However, these principles are not necessar-
ily correct because they have not yet been fully proven scientifically. Even with
the knowledge of all the developments in MALDI (Matrix Assisted Laser
Desorption / Ionization) technology that followed my discovery, I cannot yet
claim to have correctly grasped the theoretical principles behind all of these
phenomena.
   However, I am an engineer, an engineer employed in a business enterprise.
So even if the principles are unverified, their application takes priority if they
are useful and practical.


COMMERCIALIZATION AND PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT
If a business organization does not consider that a technology is basically
saleable, development would not be advanced and there would be no an-
nouncement regarding the technology outside of the company. If this tech-
nology had not been made into a product, it would have been buried in-
house and forgotten. For example, similar technology might have been
developed somewhere else in the world in the 1980‚Äôs, but if it had not been
introduced to the international scientific community, it would not have been
further developed to become a useful technique worldwide.
   Because this basic technology that we developed at the Central Research
Laboratory of Shimadzu Corporation was to be incorporated into a product,
I was transferred to the business division. However, this technology was not
made known outside the company until it was decided to release the product.
The five members of our group made the first announcement outside the
company at the Annual Conference of the Japan Mass Spectrometry Society
held in Kyoto in May of 1987 (Oral and poster presentations [16‚Äì20] were con-
ducted in Japanese). The announcement caused some reverberations, how-

                                                                                   213


ever, almost no one believed that this technology would become so useful. Of
course, we were just pleased and satisfied to confirm that we had made scien-
tific progress, and further, that we had presented it to the public.


TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER TO EUROPE AND THE USA
In September of 1987, I participated in the Second Japan-China Joint
Symposium on Mass Spectrometry that was held in Takarazuka, Japan, and
presented the result for the first time in English.[21] At that time in the 1980‚Äôs,
Plasma Desorption MS (PDMS) was widely used as a method of measuring
macromolecular compounds such as proteins.[22] During his presentation
there, Professor Robert Cotter stated that ‚ÄúPDMS can measure higher masses
than Laser Desorption/Ionization (LDI) MS.‚Äù Professor Cotter was an authority
with respect to TOF-MS even at that time, but given my own recent results,
which I would present the next day, I could not agree with his statement. I ap-
parently indicated to Professor Cotter that I thought he must be mistaken,
and that he should look at my data. Professor Cotter tells me that he was in-
deed impressed with the high mass results. He later saw my poster presenta-
tion and he and Dr. Catherine Fenselau forwarded details of our ionization
method and copies of the spectra to other researchers in Europe and the
USA.
   At that time, Dr. Takekiyo Matsuo, an assistant professor at Osaka
University who was attending the symposium, strongly recommended that I
write a formal paper in English. I reluctantly agreed, and in 1988, our contri-
bution was published in Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry
(RCM)[23], and is referred to as one of the sources of the MALDI technique.


MANUFACTURE AND THEN TERMINATION OF SALES
The analytical technology and the instrument became a commercial product.
In order to sell the instrument, I traveled around Japan visiting many cus-
tomers, and actually analyzed more than two hundred samples. However, the
reaction was almost always, ‚ÄúThere is little practical use.‚Äù I then looked fur-
ther afield and there was only one potential customer on whom we could pin
our hopes. That was Dr. Terry D. Lee of the City of Hope‚Äôs Beckman
Research Institute in the USA. This became the first and only instrument of
our commercialized product that was sold, and we eventually halted develop-
ment and sales of the instrument. Although the instrument could do what no
other instrument was capable of, it seemed to have little practical use.
Perhaps, it is fair to say that the sensitivity, accuracy and resolution required
improvement for use in pharmaceutical and medical diagnostic applications.

DEVELOPMENT OF MALDI TECHNOLOGY AND ITS USE
IN VARIOUS FIELDS
My research and development efforts on MALDI technology remained inac-
tive until 1992 when I was transferred temporarily to KRATOS Analytical (a
subsidiary company of Shimadzu Corporation from 1989) in Manchester,
England. During that period, our technology that had been conveyed to
Europe and the USA was steadily being improved upon and reformed
through the efforts of Professor Cotter, Professor Fenselau and many other
researchers throughout the world.
   Special acknowledgement is also warranted for the meritorious efforts of
both Professor Michael Karas and Professor Franz Hillenkamp [24‚Äì26] of
Germany. Were it not for their tremendous and continuous efforts and the
achievements of thousands of other researchers, it is certain that subsequent
development of this technology that has benefited so many people around
the world would not have advanced.


CONCLUSION
Development of this Macromolecule Ionization technology was not accom-
plished by one genius or gifted person. It is a victory of teamwork, and I be-
lieve it is the result of a lot of honest activity by many individuals seeking to
advance a good technology.
   The history of chemistry is long and it is natural that the field is wide and
deep. Because of this, there is a tendency to believe that chemistry-related
technology is already well developed. It should be mentioned here that I
strongly believe that building new theories and bringing them to useful roles
in the world requires the total mobilization of knowledge in specialized fields.
However, I think it can be said that the technique that I discovered and the
subsequent technologies that originated throughout the world broke
through the common knowledge of chemistry. If I had been caught within
the grasp of this knowledge, I would not have been able to make this type of
unique discovery. Even though I cannot claim to possess extraordinary intel-
lectual abilities, and further, my academic specialization was in a field other
than that of chemistry, there is enough proof that I was able to contribute to
the development of chemistry-related technology. With this in mind, it would
give me great pleasure if many people around the world, and especially engi-
neers working in private business enterprises, would mobilize their courage
and hold onto their dreams in the pursuit of scientific innovation for the be-
nefit of all living beings.
