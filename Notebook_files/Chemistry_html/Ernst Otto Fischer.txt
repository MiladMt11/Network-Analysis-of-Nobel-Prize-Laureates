INTRODUCTION
In the year 1960, I had the honour of giving a talk at this university* about
sandwich complexes on which we were working at that time. I think I do not
have to repeat the results of those investigations today. I would like to talk
instead about a field of research in which we have been intensely interested in
recent years: namely, the field of carbene complexes and, more recently,
carbyne complexes. If we substitute one of the hydrogen atoms in a hydrocarbon
of the alkane type - for example, ethane - by a metal atom, which can of
course bind many more ligands, we arrive at an organometallic compound in
which the organic radical is bound to the metal atom by a σ-bond (Fig. la). The
earliest compounds of this kind were prepared more than a hundred years ago;
the first was cacodyl, prepared by R. Bunsen (1), and then zinc dialkyls were
prepared by E. Frankland (2). Later V. Grignard was able to synthesise alkyl
magnesium halides by treating magnesium with alkyl halides (3). Grignard was
awarded the Nobel Prize in 1912 for this effort. We may further recall the
organo-aluminium compounds (4) of K. Ziegler which form the basis for the
low pressure polymerisation, for example of ethylene. Ziegler and G. Natta
were together honoured with the Nobel Prize in 1963 for their work on
organometallic compounds.

bond, i.e. a molecule of the alkene type, the roads leading to organometallic

compounds branch out (Fig. 1b). In the first place, on substituting a radical by
a metal atom, we get, as before, the σ compounds, for example, the vinyl lithium
derivatives. In the second type, only the π electrons of the double bond are used
for binding the organic molecule to the metal atom. In this way, we obtain π
complexes (5,6) (Fig. 1b), the first representative of this being Zeise’s salt
K[PtC1 3( C2H 4)], which was prepared as early as 1827 (7). Such metal π
complexes of olefins appear especially with transition metals. Main group
elements are less capable of forming such a bond. The sandwich complexes
(8,9) in which the bond between the metal and ligand takes place not only
through two π electrons alone but also through a delocalised cyclic π electron
system, may also be included in this type of compound. As an example of this we
may mention dibenzene chromium(0) (10), in which the chromium atom lies
between two parallel benzene rings that face each other in a congruent fashion.
   We get a third type of compound by formally separating the double bond and
by fixing one of the halves to a transition metal radical. This idea is realised in the
transition metal carbene complexes, in which carbenes CRR’ that have a short
life in the free state are stabilised by being bound to the metal. The first part of
my lecture will be devoted to complexes of this type.
    Finally, if we consider molecules with a carbon-carbon triple bond, of the
kind that is present in alkynes, we find here also three paths towards metal
derivatives (Fig. 1c). As in the earlier cases, we can build up σ compounds and
then utilise the two π bonds to synthesise, for example, complexes in which the
two metal-ligand bonds are situated more or less perpendicular to each other.
Finally, if we imagine the triple bond to be separated and one half to be
substituted by a metal complex radical, we arrive at carbyne complexes. I shall
deal with these complexes in the second part of my lecture.




TRANSITION METAL CARBENE COMPLEXES
PREPARATION OF THE EARLIEST CARBENE COMPLEXES
A. Maasböl and I reported some stable carbene complexes for the first time in
the year 1964 in a short communication (12). We had treated hexacarbonyl
tungsten with phenyl (and methyl) lithium in ether with the intention of adding
the carbanion to the carbon ion of a CO ligand which has been positivised with
respect to the oxygen ion. By this reaction we did in fact get lithium acyl
pentacarbonyl tungstates, which could then be converted into pentacarbonyl
[hydroxy(organyl)carbene] tungsten(0) complexes by acidifying in aqueous
solution (Eq. 1).


                                   E. O. Fischer                               107


    However, we very soon found that these complexes are not very stable.
They tend to cleave the carbene ligand with a simultaneous hydrogen displace-
ment/shift. We then get aldehydes - as also independently found by Japanese
researchers (13). Only recently we have managed to prepare these hydroxy carbene
complexes in an analytically pure form (14). However, even without isolating them,
these complexes could be converted into the much more stable methoxy carbene
compounds by treating them at an early stage with diazomethane (12).
   We soon found a more elegant method of getting the methoxy carbene
compounds by directly alkylating (15) the lithium acyl carbonyl metallates with
trialkyl oxonium tetrafhroroborates (16) (Eq. 1). H. Meerwein had also synthe-
sised these compounds in a similar manner. This method of preparation
combines several advantages: the method is clear and easy to carry out and gives
very high yields. It also makes it possible to prepare a wide spectrum of carbene
complexes. Thus, for example, instead of phenyl lithium, many other organo-
lithium compounds (17-23) can be used. Similarly, instead of the hexacarbonyl
tungsten used first, one can use hexacarbonyl chromium (17), hexacarbonyl
molybdenum (17), the di-metal decacarbonyls of manganese (24,25), technetium
(25) and rhenium (25), pentacarbonyl iron (26) and tetracarbonyl nickel (27).
However, the corresponding carbene complexes become increasingly
unstable in the above sequence. Finally, substituted metal carbonyl (27-30) can
also be subjected to carbanion addition followed by alkylation. The carbene
complexes are generally quite stable, diamagnetic, easily soluble in organic
solvents, and sublimable. Before going into the details about their reactions,
I would like to deal briefly with the binding conditions of the carbene
ligand/metal bond.




OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE NATURE OF THE BOND
AND SPECTROSCOPIC RESULTS
SPECULATIONS ABOUT THE BONDS AND SPECTROSCOPIC
RESULTS
The first X-ray structure determination (31), carried out by O. S. Mills in
collaboration with us, on pentacarbonyl [methoxy (phenyl) carbene] chromium
(0) confirmed our notion about the bonds postulated earlier. Our notion was
that the carbon atom of carbene is present in the sp 2-hybridised form. It should
therefore have a vacant p-orbital and should hence show an electron deficit.
   This strong electron deficiency is compensated mainly through a           bond
between one of the free electron pairs of the oxygen atom of the methoxygroup
and the unoccupied p-state of the carbene carbon atom. A                  reverse
bonding takes place - to a smaller yet appreciable extent - from an occupied
central metal orbital with a suitable symmetry to this vacant p-orbital of
the carbene carbon. This can be deduced from the distances between the
carbene carbon atom and the oxygen atom on the one hand, and between
the carbene carbon atom and the central chromium atom on the other hand.

 numerical values for a single bond (1.43 Å in diethyl ether) and a double bond
(1.23 Å in acetone). While the Cr-CCO distance in the carbene complex is 1.87 Å
 on average, the Cr-C c a r b e n e distance was found to be 2.04Å. For a pure
 chromium-carbon (σ bond, one would expect the distance to be 2.21 Å accord-
 ing to the arguments of F. A. Cotton (32). According to these arguments, the
 bond order for the Cr-Ccarbene bond is much smaller than for the chromium-CCO
bond in the same complex, but greater than the bond order in a single bond.
That the phenyl group does not form any               bond with the carbene carbon
- at least in the lattice - is clear from the intense twisting of the plane formed
by the atoms Cr, C and O and the twisting of the phenyl ring. We can see at the
same time that the double bond character of the C carbene -O bond is so strong that
cisand transisomerswith respect to the CO bond can easily occur (Fig. 2). In the
case of pentacarbonyl [methoxy(phenyl)carbene]chromium(0) we only find
molecules of the trans type in the lattice, but at low temperatures the cis isomer
can also be detected by 1H-NMR spectroscopy (33,34).

    Further important insights into the bond situations in carbene complexes
 are provided by the        spectra (20,35-37). As we know, the carbon monoxide
 ligands in metal carbonyls can be regarded as weak donor systems. They provide
 electron density from the free electron pair of the carbon to unoccupied
 orbitals of the metal atom. This would lead to a formally negative charging of the
 metal. This negative charge is broken down to a great extent by a reverse
 transport of charge density from the metal to the carbon monoxide through
         back bonding; that is, the carbon has an acceptor function in addition
 to its donor function. This donor/acceptor ratio of the CO ligands of a complex
 represents a very sensitive probe for the electronic properties of the other
 ligands bonded to the metal. This ratio can be qualitatively estimated by
 determining the CO stretching vibrations
    Let us now compare carbon monoxide and methoxy (phenyl) carbene as
 ligands in complexes of the type (CO)5Crl (L=CO or [C(OCH3) C6H 5]) with


                                                                             109


regard to their v absorptions: while the total symmetrical Raman-active v
                 co                                                           co


stretching vibration in Cr(CO) 6 appears at 2108 cm-1 (Al,) (38) we find that
the CO absorption of the CO group in the trans-position with respect to the
carbene ligand is shifted drastically towards lower wave numbers, namely 1953
c m-1 ( Al) (17); that is, the carbene ligand has a much greater (σ donor/π
acceptor ratio than CO. In other words the carbene ligand is on the whole
positively polarised, and the Cr (CO)5 part is negatively polarised. The dipole
moments of the complexes are therefore also relatively high, about 5 Debye.
   In what follows, I would not like to go into the details of the spectroscopic
studies as such. It may, however, be pointed out briefly that 13C-NMR measure-
ments are extremely useful for research in this area of chemistry. In one such
early study on pentacarbonyl [methoxy(phenyl)carbene]chromium(0), C. G.
Kreiter (39) could show that the carbene carbon atom is highly positivised.
The chemical shift that was found, namely 351.42 ppm, is in fact; within the
range of values of carbonium ions in organic chemistry. This modern method
has thus confirmed our original proposal once again.
   With its high “positive” charge character, the carbene carbon acts as an
electrophilic centre. This is of great importance when one is looking at the
reactions of these compounds. We shall come back to these reactions in
the course of this lecture.


SYNTHESES OF OTHER CARBENE COMPLEXES
Our first paper on metal carbene complexeswas published in 1964. This area of
work has expanded rapidly since then. A number of fairly extensive review
articles (40-43) on the chemistry of carbene complexes have now appeared. I
shall therefore pick out only a few examples, particularly of those involving
interesting syntheses.
  In 1968, K. Öfele treated l.ldichloro 2.3diphenyl cyclopropene (2) with
disodium pentacarbonyl chromate in our laboratory and obtained pentacarbonyl
(2.3diphenyl cyclopropenylidene) chromium (0) with the elimination of
sodium chloride (44). This carbene compound is stable up to 200° C and has
the characteristic property that the carbene ligand no longer has any hetero
atom. The electronic saturation of the carbene carbon takes place in this
reaction through the three-ring π system (Eq. 2).




   X-ray structural analysis (45) showed that the three C-C distances in the
ligand are not identical: the distance between the two phenyl substituted C
atoms is somewhat shorter than the other two. The carbene carbonchromium


110                                Chemistry 1973

distance is 2.05 Å and lies in the range of the values found for our carbene
complexes, i.e. this complex must be a genuine carbene complex.
   Another fine method of synthesis was published by R. L. Richards et al. in
1969 (46). They found that in the reaction of alcohols with certain isonitrile
complexes, for example the isonitrile platinum complex, addition of the alkoxy
group at the carbon atom and the hydrogen at the nitrogen atom of the
isonitrile ligand takes place, resulting in the corresponding carbene complexes,
for example (Eq. 3).




   This method of synthesis has since led to several such compounds. We notice
here the similarity between the chemistry of isonitrile complexes and carbon
monoxide complexes.
   In 1971 we succeeded, for the first time once again, in transferring a
carbene ligand from one complex to another (26, 47). For example, if we
irradiate a solution of cyclopentadienyl(carbonyl) [methoxy(phenyl) carbene]
nitrosylmolybdenum(0) in the presence of an excess of pentacarbonyl iron, we
get tetracarbonyl [methoxy (phenyl) carbene] iron (0) with the simultaneous
formation of cyclopentadienyl (dicarbonyl) nitrosylmolybdenum (Eq. 4).




   Finally, another method of synthesis was developed recently (1971) by M. F.
Lappert et al. (48). They treated an electron-rich olefinic system, such as
N.N.N’.N’-tetraphenyl bis dihydroimidazolylidene, with a suitable complex.
In this way, they were able to split the double bond and fix the carbene halves at
the metal, for example (Eq. 5).




  This was a brief survey of other methods for the synthesis of carbene
complexes found independently by other workers.

POSSIBLE REACTIONS OF CARBENE COMPLEXES
In what follows, I shall confine myself to carbene complexes of our type and I
shall show, with some examples from recent times, the kinds of reactions
that we could observe with these complexes.

             Fig. 3. Possible reactions of alkoxy carbene complexes.


   We have already pointed out that the carbene carbon atom is an electrophilic
centre and should therefore have a high nucleophilic reactivity. Hence, according
to our present understanding, in most reactions a nucleophile would be added
to the carbene carbon atom in the primary reaction stage. In some cases, for
example in the case of some phosphines (49) and tertiary amines (50), such
addition products can be isolated in an analytically pure form under certain
conditions        in Fig. 3). Another possible reaction is that the nucleophilic
agent substitutes a carbon monoxide group in the complex while preserving the
carbene ligand        in Fig. 3). The carbene complex can also be regarded in a
veryformalway from the point of view of an ester-like system (X = C          where
X = M (CO)5 instead of X = O) since the oxygen atom as well as the metal atom
in the M(CO)5 radical have two electrons less than the number of electrons
required for attaining the rare gas configuration. Therefore, it is not surprising
that the OR radical can be substituted by amino, thio and seleno groups           in
Fig. 3). This leads us to the synthesis of amino (organyl) carbene complexes (36,
51-54) thio (organyl) carbene complexes (51, 55) and seleno (organyl)
carbene complexes. The synthesis of the last two series of complexes requires
some experimental skill.
   We can also observe reactionswhich lead to a more stable arrangement of the
entire system through a primary addition followed by a rearrangement              in
Fig. 3). It can be noticed further that the hydrogen atoms of alkyl groups in the
a position with respect to the carbene carbon atom are so acidic - because of
the electron pull of the M(CO)5 radical - that their acidity is similar to that
of the hydrogen atoms in nitromethane          in Fig. 3). Finally the separation of
the carbene ligand from the metal complex opens up new synthetic routes in
organic chemistry        in Fig. 3).


ADDITION AND CO SUBSTITUTION
If we treat trialkyl phosphines with pentacarbonyl [alkoxy (organyl) carbene]
complexes of chromium(0) and tungsten(0), for example, in hexane at


112


temperatures below -30°C, the corresponding phosphorylide complexes (which
 are addition compounds) can be isolated in an analytically pure form and
 studied (49). The erstwhile carbene carbon is now sp 3 hybridised and now has
 only a σ-bond at the central metal. In the case of triaryl and mixed alkyl aryl
 phosphines, the addition-dissociation equilibrium (57) (Fig. 4) lies to a great
 extent on the side of the starting materials, so that the ylide complexes can
 be detected only by spectroscopy. Figure 4 shows the reaction scheme
 for pentacarbonyl[methoxy(methyl)carbene]chromium(0) and tertiary
 phosphines.




   On irradiating solutions of these ylide complexes in hexane-toluene mixtures
at         we get the cis-tetracarbonyl[alkoxy(organyl)carbene] phosphine
complexes (58) with elimination of a CO ligand from the cis position. That is,
the phosphine which is at first added to the carbene carbon of the starting
complex, substitutes a CO ligand at the metal atom and the carbene grouping is
formed once again. To a smaller extent, the carbene ligand is also substituted by
phosphine. We arrive at the same products if we employ only the equilibrium
mixtures of pentacarbonyl carbene complexes and phosphines under slightly
modified conditions (at -20°C in THF) instead of the isolated ylide complexes
(58). But, if the reaction is carried out thermally - at 70°C in hexane -
mixtures of the cis and trans isomers are formed instead of the pure cis
tetracarbonyl carbene phosphine complexes (59, 60). We were able to isolate


                                      E. O. Fischer                                 113


the cis and trans isomers in pure form (60). On heating solutions of either of
these components (separately) isomerisation takes place until an equilibrium
is attained (61). We were especially interested in the mechanism and found
that the isomerisation reaction (62) follows first order kinetics, that the reaction
rate is not influenced by the presence of the free ligands, phosphine and carbon
monoxide, and that the isomerisation rate is greater in tetracarbo-
nyl[methoxy(methyl)carbene] triethyl phosphine chromium(O) than in the
corresponding tricyclohexyl phosphine complex. Now, how do we visualise this
process of isomerism? The findings suggest an intramolecular mechanism in
which none of the bonds of the six monodentate ligands with the metal are
broken or formed afresh during the change from the cis isomer to the trans
isomer and vice versa. Instead there could be a twist in the two planes formed by
any three ligands, by 120° in opposite directions (twist mechanism) (Fig. 5).

phosphine chromium(O).


   Since this process passes through a trigonal-prismatic transition state with an
increased steric inhibition, it is also quite understandable that the compound
with the highly cumbersome tricyclohexyl phosphine ligand isomerises at a
slower rate than the corresponding triethyl phosphine complex.


TRANSITION METAL/CARBENE COMPLEX RADICALS AS
PROTECTIVE AMINO GROUPS FOR AMINO ACIDS AND PEPTIDES
If we treat the alkoxy carbene complexes with primary or secondary amines,
instead of phosphines, we observe a new type of reaction which is similar to the
reactions of esters. We have been greatly interested in this type of reaction in
recent times and it has shown us a new approach to the chemistry of peptides -
quite a surprising approach for a chemist dealing with complexes. We could
show that the alkoxy group of alkoxy (organyl) carbene complexes can be
substituted not only by mono or dialkyl amino radicals but also by free amino
groups of amino acid esters and peptide esters (63, 64). The principle of this
reaction is shown in Eq. 6.
   Even at         not only simple amino acid esters but also polyfunctional
amino acid esters react with alkoxy (organyl) carbene complexes in ether
solution without protection of the third function. The organometallic radical
thus represents a new and interesting protecting group, especially because it
can be easily separated again by treatment with trifluoro acetic acid. In some


114                                Chemistry 1973


cases, this separation can be done even with acetic acid, in a milder reaction.




   I shall now show, with another example, that one can add further amino acid
groups to an amino ester carbene complex by the usual methods of peptide
chemistry (64). Starting with pentacarbonyl (phenyl carbene) GlyOMe
chromium (0) we were able to synthesise, for example, the sequence 14 to 17 of
the human proinsulin C peptide - as shown by Eq. 17 - by the NHS/DCCD
method (N-hydroxy succinimide/dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) .




   We are now working with E. Wiinsch in this area and we believe that the
utilisation of such carbene complexes could offer a number of new routes and
advantages to the peptide chemist:


                                   E. 0. Fischer                              115

(1) Such amino acid or peptide derivatives are yellow and hence easy to
    distinguish, for example in chromatographic methods.
(2) This protecting group can be separated under milder conditions; the
    reaction products that are formed in addition to the amino acid or peptide
    esters - mainly aldehydes and metal hexacarbonyls - are volatile and
    can therefore be easily separated.
(3) Most carbene complexes of amino acid esters and many dipeptide esters are
    volatile and can be studied by mass spectroscopy.
(4) We have here a method by which heavy metal atoms like tungsten can be
    incorporated in peptides and free amino groups can thus be marked.



ADDITION AND REARRANGEMENT REACTIONS
Here are two recent examples to illustrate this type of reaction of carbene
complexes. Pentacarbonyl [methyl( thiomethyl)carbene] chromium (0) and
tungsten(0) react at low temperatures with hydrogen bromide to form
pentacarbonyl[ (1-bromoethyl) methylsulfide] complexes (65) (Eq. 8).




   In this process, the original carbene carbon loses its bond with the transition
metal and sulphur occupies this position. The second example shows that such
a reaction need not always result in an uncharged system. That is, instead of
thiocarbene complexes, if we use aminocarbene complexes in the
reaction with hydrogen halides, salt-like compounds can be isolated (66). After
the reaction we find the halogen at the metal, the hydrogen at the eliminated
carbene ligand, and we get imonium halogeno pentacarbonyl metallates.




  We thus have a method for synthesising such cations and this method allows
great variations in this type of compound, which are not easily accessible.

HYDROGEN SUBSTITUTION AT THE                                      ATOM
C. G. Kreiter (67) was the first to show the acidity of hydrogen atoms bound to
the     atom of alkoxy (alkyl) carbene complexes by 1H-NMR spectroscopic
studies. Solutions of pentacarbonyl[methoxy(methyl)carbene]chromium(0)
in CH 3OD, in the presence of catalytic quantities of sodium methylate,
exchange all the hydrogen atoms at the methyl group bound to the carbene
carbon with deuterium (Eq. 10).




                                                   Explanation:




   The base is thus evidently in a position to form an anion through reversible
elimination of a proton in the α position with respect to the carbene carbon.
This reaction can also be utilised to introduce new groups into the carbene
ligand at this position (40, 68).
   By its nature, this acidity is closely connected with the strong positively
charged character of the carbene carbon atom. Let me once again therefore
take up at this point the unusual C-NMR spectroscopic shifts of this atom,
                                    13

   If we start with the methoxy (phenyl) carbene complex, for which a shift of
351.4 ppm was measured (39) and replace the methoxy group with the
dimethyl amino group which has a better stabilising effect, the value of δ drops
as expected to 270.6 ppm (66). On the other hand, in the diphenyl carbene
complex, δ has a value of 399.4 ppm (69). We have been working on this
compound recently and we have in this compound an extremely highly
positivised carbon atom, even when composed to the values found for organic
carbonium ions. The two phenyl groups are therefore now hardly capable of

compensating for the electron deficit at the carbene carbon. This chromium
carbene complex is much more unstable than the homologous tungsten
compound reported recently by C. P. Casey (70).


ELIMINATION OF THE CARBENE LIGAND
Reaction with acids
I do not want to try the patience of the organic chemists present here with too
many details about the chemistry of complex compounds. I shall therefore
mention here some applications of carbene complexes that may be of interest to
organic chemists. I think the epoch of “inorganic” and “organic” chemistry as
watertight compartments is now over. We must now consider all possible
avenues that nature offers us.
   The road to organic chemistry will be open when it becomes possible to
separate the carbene ligand from the metal under conditions that are not too
drastic. This is now possible with hydrogen halides in methylene chloride at a
temperature as low as -78° (71) (Eq. 11).




   This reaction leads to pentacarbonyl halogeno tungsten hydrides. Unlike the
corresponding anions, these compounds were not known earlier, as far as we
know. The neutral hydride complexesarevery unstable and are almost completely
dissociated in aqueous solution into hydronium cations and pentacarbonyl
halogen tungstate anions. The anions can be precipitated in the form of
tetramethyl ammonium salts (71) for example (Eq. 12).




   We found some indications concerning the fate of the cleaved carbene ligand
from other studies. That is, if we treat tetracarbonyl [methoxy(organyl) carbene]
triphenyl phosphine chromium(O) with benzoic acid or acetic acid in boiling
ether, we can isolate the              organyl esters of these acids (72) (Eq. 13).




                                                                                (13)

   This secondary reaction amounts to a formal insertion of the carbene radical
into the OH group of the carboxylic acid. Triphenyl phosphine, which is added
to the reaction mixture, merely serves to improve the separation of the
organometallic radical in the form of the poorly soluble tetracarbonyl bis
(triphenyl phosphine) chromium(0) complex. The reaction with HCl
proceeds similarly; but the insertion products formed, namely, a-halogen
organyl (methyl) ethers, react immediately with the phosphine present to form
the corresponding phosphonium salts (72).
   The following question of course arises in this connection: What happens to
the eliminated carbene ligand when no suitable reaction partner is available?
The reaction conditions employed are of decisive importance in answering the
question.


Reaction with pyridine
Right at the beginning of our studies on carbene complexes, we observed that
the carbene radical can be easily broken off from the metal with the help of
pyridine, and that the metal fragment can be separated in the form of carbonyl
pyridine chromium complexes (73). In the case of alkoxy (alkyl) carbene
complexes, a hydrogen atom of the eliminated carbene radical shifts, with the
help of the base, towards the original carbene carbon atom, with the formation
of enol ether (73, 74) (Eq. 14).




                                                                            (14)




Thermal decomposition
To check whether the base has an effect on the (secondary) reaction of the
carbene ligand, we decomposed pentacarbonyl[ methoxy(methyl) carbene]
chromium(0) purely thermally at 150°C in decalin. Under these conditions
we observed the exclusive formation of the dimer; to be precise, as a mixture
of the cis and trans isomers (74). The reaction must therefore be as follows
(Eq. 15).


                                       E. O. Fischer                         119


   Since the shifting of a hydrogen atom is not possible in the case of the
methoxy (phenyl) carbene ligand, only dimerisation takes place in the reac-
tions with bases as well as with thermal decomposition.


Reactions with elements of the sixth group in the periodic table
We are of course especially interested in those reactions which lead to products
that are not easily accessible by the conventional methods of organic chemistry
and which can be prepared easily with our complexes. We found such an
example in the reaction of pentacarbonyl[methoxy(aryl)carbene]chromium(0)
complexes with oxygen, sulphur and selenium (76). By this reaction we can
easily get the corresponding methyl esters, thio-O-methyl esters and seleno-O-
methyl esters. The latter two types of compounds seem important to us from the
synthetic point of view (Eq. 16).




Reactions with vinyl ethers and N-vinyl pyrrolidones
At quite an early stage of our studies on carbene complexes, we had argued that
these compounds would deserve their name only if they underwent reactions
typical of carbenes.
   In this connection the organic chemist will immediately recall the formation
of cyclopropane derivatives from olefins and carbenes. We very soon found that
this reaction was also possible with our complexes and those C = C double
bonds which are deficient in electrons and are either polarised or easily
polarisable (77-81). As an example of this, I would like to mention the reaction
of pentacarbonyl [methoxy(phenyl)carbene] chromium(0), molybdenum(0)
and tungsten(0) with ethylvinyl ether (79). However, we get the corresponding
cyclopropane derivatives only if we cleave the carbene ligand in an autoclave at
50°C under CO atmosphere at a pressure of 170 atm. (Eq. 17).


120                                Chemistry 1973




   As expected, we find two isomers [(a) and (b) in Eq. 17]. Under the same
reaction conditions, the ratio of the two isomers depends on the choice of the
central metal. This seems to us to be a rather definite pointer that this reaction
takes place not through a “free” methoxy (phenyl) carbene, but that, to the
contrary, the metal atom is involved at the decisive stage of the reaction.
   When we try to carry out this reaction, under similar conditions, with vinyl
pyrrolidone (2) as the olefin component, we get, instead of the expected
cyclopropane derivative, quite surprisingly, 1-[4methoxy-4-phenyl-butene (1)-
on(3)yl] pyrrolidone(2) (82) (Eq. 18).




                                                                              (18)




   How do we explain the formation of this unexpected product, in which we
find carbon monoxide also added to the carbene ligand and pyrrolidone?
(Fig. 7).
   We now believe that the carbene ligand first reacts with carbon monoxide
to form methoxy(phenyl)ketene. This forms a cyclobutanone derivative with
the polarised olefin, which is converted into the product found - via a ring
opening.
   This hypothesis has been reinforced by the subsequent finding that on
using N-(β-methyl vinyl) pyrrolidone (2) instead of N-vinyl-pyrrolidone (2) we
could isolate the postulated four-ring system in addition to the open-chain end
product (82).
   Our original idea of using carbon monoxide only for cleaving the carbene
ligand thus led us to an unexpected result and showed at the same time that the
reactivity of carbon monoxide with respect to organic systems should not be
ignored.
   In an attempt to obtain the cyclopropane derivatives which we wanted, we
reacted the same starting materials thermally in benzene in the absence
of CO. But in this attempt also, we did not get the desired compounds,

but, surprisingly, the corresponding substituted α-methoxy styrenes (83)
(Eq. 19).




  A possible course of the reaction might be as follows:
  N-vinyl-pyrrolidone(2) also has a nucleophilic centre at the oxygen atom.
This nucleophilic centre could attack the electrophilic carbene carbon and
separate the carbene ligand from the metal. The intermediate product thus

membered ring - then undergoes a cleavage similar to the heterolytic
fragmentation reported by C. A. Grob (84) (Fig. 8).

Reactions with electrophilic carbenes
As shown right at the beginning of this lecture, the carbene ligand in
carbene complexes of our type provides a “nucleophilic” behaviour with
respect to the metal fragment. One of our pet ideas was thus to combine the
carbene ligand with an electrophilic carbene. We therefore treated
pentacarbonyl [methoxy(phenyl)carbene] chromium (0) with phenyl
(trichloromethyl) mercury (85). Compounds of this kind have been studied in
detail by D. Seyferth and they are recognised as starting materials for dihalo
carbenes (86). The carbene complex and the carbenoid compound could be
made to react at 80°C in benzene to form                          styrene (85)
(Eq. 20).

   This combination reaction is very sensitive to temperature conditions.
Even greater complications arose on using phenyl (tribromomethyl) mercury,
with the formation of mixtures of olefins.
   With this small selection from our recent research results, I think I have been
able to show you the wide variety of possible reactions offered by the chemistry
of transition metal carbene complexes.
   I would now like to report to you our findings in another related area on
which we have been working very intensively recently: the chemistry of
transition metal carbine complexes.




TRANSITION METAL CARBYNE COMPLEXES
To explore all the possible reactions of transition metal carbene complexes,
we had attempted some years ago to make our complexes react with electrophilic
reaction partners in addition to nucleophilic reaction partners. Our idea was to
exchange the methoxy group of methoxy (organyl) carbene complexes by a
halogen with the help of borontrihalides and thus to arrive at halogeno
(organyl) carbene complexes. We did observe a fast reaction but found only
decomposition products. But recently, in collaboration with G. Kreis, we
carried out this reaction at very low temperatures and could isolate well-
defined compounds which were, however, thermally quite unstable (87). Their
composition was equivalent to the sum of a metal tetracarbonyl fragment, a
halogen and the carbene ligand minus the methoxy group (Eq. 21).

  The IR spectra indicated the presence of disubstituted hexacarbonyls with
two different ligands in the trans position (trans (CO)4M R1R 2). Moreover,
the cryoscopic determination of molecular weight showed the presence of a
monomer complex. Together with other spectroscopic findings, especially

from 13C and 1H-NMR studies, this could be interpreted only if we assumed
that, besides the four CO ligands, a halogen and a CR group bonded to the
metal had to be present (Fig. 9).




              Fig. 9. Structure and model of bonds for (CO)4 (X)MCR.


   We would like to propose the name “carbyne complexes” for this new type of
compound, for two reasons: (1) on the analogy of “carbene complexes”and (2)
on the analogy of the term “alkyne”, because on the basis of the diamagnetism of
these compounds, we must postulate a formal metal-carbon triple bond.


X-RAY STRUCTURE ANALYSES
Such a triple bond should result in a very short distance between the metal and the
carbyne carbon. To answer this question and to confirm the proposed structure,
X-ray structural analyses have been carried out in our institute by
G. Huttner et al. on three carbyne complexes so far (88).
   The first such study was done on trans-(iodo)tetracarbonyl(phenyl-
carbyne) tungsten (0) (87, 88) (Fig. 10).




      Fig. 10. Molecular structure of trans-(iodo) tetracarbonyl(phenylcarbyne) tungsten (0).



   This study essentially confirmed our ideas and gave an extremely short
tungsten-carbon distance of 1.90 Å. Instead of the linear arrangement of metal,
C carbyne       (phenyl) atoms, however, we found a clear bending of about 162°.
Since we could not explain at this stage whether this bending was due to


                                       E. 0. Fischer                                       125


electronic or lattice effects, we immediately undertook the study of
another complex. Figure 11 shows the result: the structure of trans-(iodo)-
tetracarbonyl(methyl carbyne)chromium(0) (88).




   Fig. 11. Molecular structure of trans-(iodo) tetracarbonyl(methylcarbyne)chromium(0).




   In this compound we found not only the expected linear arrangement of the
chromium, carbon and methyl group, but also the shortest distance between
chromium and carbon found so far, namely 1.69 Å. This value is appreciably
shorter than the Cr-Cco distance in the same complex ( 1.946 Å or in hexacarbonyl
chromium (1.91 Å).
   Subsequently we were interested in the question whether second sub-
stituents in the starting carbene complex can influence the orientation of the
halogen in the resulting carbyne complex. To answer this question, we first
treated cis-tetracarbonyl[methoxy(methyl)carbene]trimethylphosphine, arsine
and stibine chromium (0) with borontrihalides (89) (Eq. 22).




   The reaction proceeded as smoothly as before, but in the compounds with
the composition (CO) 3[Y(CH 3)3] (X)Cr = CCH3 (X = Cl, Br, I and Y= P, As, Sb)
that were formed, the mutual spatial arrangement of the ligands could not at
first be clearly determined. An X-ray structural analysis was therefore carried
out on a representative compound of this type (88-90) (Fig. 12).
   For (bromo)tricarbonyl (methylcarbyne) trimethylphosphinechromium(0),
we found a meridional arrangement of the three substituents and, again, a
trans-arrangement of the halogen and carbyne ligand. We are at present
studying how a carbene complex with an initial trans-configuration behaves in
the reaction with borontrihalides (89).

REACTIONS OF OTHER PENTACARBONYL CARBENE COMPLEXES
WITH BORONTRIHALIDES
We thought it would also be interesting to study the effects of changes in the
organic radical of the carbyne ligand on the stability and behaviour of these
compounds. For this purpose, we treated a number of phenyl-substituted
pentacarbonyl[methoxy(aryl)carbene]tungsten(0) complexes with
borontribromide (91) (Eq. 23).




                                                                                                (23)




    C-NMR spectroscopy seemed to us to be a suitable tool for studying
   13



electronic changes in this case. Figure 13 compares the chemical shifts of the
carbyne carbon atoms of the resulting trans-(bromo) tetracarbonyl(ary1
carbyne) tungsten (0) complexes (87,92).

   Quite unexpectedly, we find in this series that the p-CF3 derivative has the
lowest value of δ, i.e. the strongest screening for the carbyne carbon atom; we
find a much weaker screening for the 2.4.6 trimethyl phenyl compound. We
need more data to interpret this result exactly and experiments for this purpose
are in progress.
   We could further show that not only methoxy(organyl)carbenecomplexes
react with borontrihalides in the manner described above. We found that
trans-(bromo) tetracarbonyl (phenyl carbyne) chromium(0) and trans-
(bromo) tetracarbonyl(phenyl carbyne) tungsten(0) can also be obtained by
treatingpentacarbonyl[hydroxy(phenyl)carbene]chromium(0) (93) aswellas
pentacarbonyl(phenyl carbene)glycinemethylestertungsten(0) (64) (Eqs. 24
and 25) with borontrihalides.




   I would like to point out especially that the reaction of the aminoacidcarbene
complex with borontribromide offers another convenient way of cleaving the
metal pentacarbonyl (phenyl carbene)yl protecting group - under very mild
conditions, namely, even at -25°C.
   The fact that experimental results cannot always be generalised is shown by
thereactionofcis-(bromo)tetracarbonyl[hydroxy(methyl)carbene]manganese
with borontribromide. The reaction does not lead to the analogous carbyne
complex, but to a product in which the hydrogen atom of the hydroxy group is
replaced by the BBr2 radical (92) (Eq. 26).




   The situation here does not seem to be conducive to the formation of a
carbyne complex because of the “fixation” of the OH group by the formation of
a bridge with the bromide ligand in the cis position. Another interesting
question was how pentacarbonyl[ethoxy(diethylamino)carbene] tungsten(O)
would react with borontrihalide, because - as we have seen earlier - in
principle the alkoxy group as well as the amino group can be cleaved. The

experiment led totheexclusiveformationoftrans-(bromo) tetracarbonyl(diethyl
amino carbyne) tungsten (0) (95) -a compound that can be handled relatively
easily. Its stability is probably due to the interaction of the metal/carbon bond
with the free electron pair of nitrogen. This explanation is also supported by 13C-
NMR measurements (Eq. 27).




REACTIONS OF PENTACARBONYL CARBENE COMPLEXES WITH
ALUMINIUM AND GALLIUM HALIDES
We could extend the scope of our method of synthesis by using aluminium
trichloride, aluminium tribromide and gallium trichloride instead of
borontrihalides (96) (Eq. 28). With these compounds we also obtained
carbyne complexes in good yields.




REACTIONS OF LITHIUM BENZOYL PENTACARBONYL
TUNGSTATES WITH TRIPHENYLPHOSPHINE DIBROMIDE
A new method of synthesis - new in principle - was discovered from the
reaction of lithium benzoyl pentacarbonyl tungstate with triphenyl phosphine
dibromide, at low temperatures in ether (97) (Eq. 29).


                                   E. 0. Fischer                               129

   The first step is presumably the establishment of a Ccarbene -O-P bond with the
formation of lithium bromide. The intermediate product thus formed
could then be stabilised by reaction between the second bromine atom and
the metal, elimination of a CO ligand and the cleavage of triphenyl phosphine
oxide under thermodynamically favourable conditions to form the carbyne
complex.


REACIVITY OF THE CARBYNE LIGAND
With the carbyne complexes also, we did not wish to confine ourselves to the
preparation and spectroscopic study of new representatives of this type of
compound. We therefore began, in the meantime, to study their reactivity. We
first looked for a possible way of comparing such a metal-carbon triple bond
with a carbon-carbon triple bond. We found this in the reaction of dimethyl
amine with trans-(bromo) tetracarbonyl (phenyl acetylenyl carbyne) tungsten (0)
(98). This latter compound can be obtained by treating pentacarbonyl
[ethoxy(phenylacetylenyl)carbene] tungsten(0) (21) with borontribromide.
We found that at -40°C in ether only addition to the organic triple bond takes
place while the carbyne-metal bond remains unchanged (99) (Eq. 30).




   At the same time we also tried to study how the carbyne ligand behaves when
it is cleaved from the metal. As with the carbene complexes, a dimerisation
takes place in the absence of a suitable reaction partner, but alkines are formed
in this case (100). The conditions for the decomposition are very mild.
   Tolane or dimethyl acetylene can be obtained in this way in non-polar
solvents even at 30°C. We get the same result on heating the solid methyl
carbyne complex to 50°C (Eq. 31).
   We think that the path is now open for utilising carbyne complexes to
synthesise organic compounds. As far as we know, no systematic source of
“carbyne complexes” is now available for the purpose of synthesis. Because the

cleavage conditions are mild, there is a wide scope here for interesting
applications.
   That brings me to the end of my lecture. I hope I have shown you that
organometallic chemistry offers many more interesting possibilities.
