THE BORANES AND THEIR RELATIVES

This year, 1976, the Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded for research
in pure inorganic chemistry, in particular the boranes. May I say that I am
most pleased and profoundly grateful. My own orientation to this field has
been, as it has in all of my studies, the relationships of the chemical behavior
of molecules to their three-dimensional geometrical and electronic structures.
The early work on the molecular structures of boranes by X-ray diffraction led
to a reasonable basis for a theory of chemical bonding different from that
which is typical in carbon chemistry, and yielded an understanding of the
pleasing polyhedral-like nature of these compounds. Assimilated by the
preparative chemists, the principles helped to establish a large body of a
hitherto unknown chemistry, which made a reality of the expectation that
boron, next to carbon in the periodic table, should indeed have a complex
chemistry.
   In these nearly thirty years both the theoretical and experimental methods
have been applied by us and others to areas of inorganic, physical, organic and
biochemistry. For examples, these areas include low temperature X-ray
diffraction techniques, and the theoretical studies of multicentered chemical
bonds including both delocalized and localized molecular orbitals. An early
example is extended Hückel theory, originally developed for studies of the
boranes, and even now one of the most widely applicable approximate methods
for theoretical studies of bonding in complex molecules. More soundly based
theories are presently in use by my research students for studying how enzymes
catalyze reactions, details of which are based on the three-dimensional struc-
tures by X-ray diffraction methods. Besides illuminating particular problems,
these developments may contribute toward the redefinition of areas of chemist-
try, and thereby broaden the chemist’s view. Our research in the boranes and
their related molecular species crosses areas of inorganic, experimental
physical, theoretical and organic chemistry, and includes applications in
biochemistry. More simply stated, the area is the study of the relationships of
molecular structure to function.



BORANES, AND EARLY STRUCTURE STUDIES
By now, large numbers of chemical compounds related to polyborane chemistry
exist: boron hydrides, carboranes, metalloboranes, metallocarboranes, mixed
compounds with organic moieties, and others. These discoveries of preparative
chemists are relatively recent. Long ago, Alfred Stock established borane
chemistry. He developed the experimental techniques which were required

for the preparation of the volatile and potentially explosive compounds, B2H6,
B4H10, B5H9, B5H11 and B6H10, and the relatively stable white crystalline B10H14. This
work, beautifully summarized in his Baker Lectures,1 was celebrated in the Third
International Meeting on Boron Chemistry this past July in Munich, 100 years after
his birth. Sidgwick2 wrote, “All statements about the hydrides of boron earlier than
1912, when Stock began to work on them, are untrue.”
 Aside from the classification as either an N+4 or an N+6 series, no simple basis
for these unusual formulas was foreseen before their structures were established. A
B6 octahedron (Fig. 1) was known in certain crystalline borides, and the B12
icosahedron (Fig. 2) was found in boron carbide, but no one realized that a
systematic description of the boron arrangements in these hydrides might be based
on fragments of these polyhedra. Most electron diffraction work before 1940
supported more open structures, which Pauling3 described in terms of resonating
one-electron bonds. In 1940-1941 Stitt4 produced infrared and thermodynamic
evidence for the bridge structure of B2H6 (Fig. 3). More general realization of the
correctness of this structure followed the theoretical studies,5-8 and especially the
infrared work of Price.9 The three-center bridge BHB bond was clearly formulated
by Longuet-Higgins.8

   The first of the higher hydrides to be structurally characterized was B 10H 11
(Fig. 4). Kasper, Lucht and Harker10 showed that the boron arrangement was
a fragment of a B12 icosahedron in which there are four bridge BHB bonds in
the open face. Next was B5H 9,11 , 12 (Fig. 5), a fragment of the B6, octahedron,
and then B 4H 10
                  13,14
                        (Fig. 6), a B4 unit from these polyhedra. Both of these
structures were established by X-ray diffraction in our laboratory, and by
electron diffraction at the California Institute of Technology. Our X-ray
diffraction results on B 5H 1115 (Fig. 7) and tetrahedral B 4Cl 4 then set the stage
                                                                 16



for the beginning of the theory of bonding. The B 6H 10 structure, 17,18 (Fig. 8)
completing the compounds found by Stock, was to be one of our later X-ray
diffraction studies, which were to include many other boranes and related
molecules.
   It was actually in 1946 that I decided to enter this area of inorganic chem-
istry. At that time, no reliable methods were generally available for accumula-
tion of large amounts of X-ray diffraction data at low temperatures. Our
methods 19 paralleled those in Fankuchen’s laboratory20 at the then Polytechnic
Institute of Brooklyn, but were quite independent. Because of the special
difficulties of working with the volatile boranes, I chose among other topics,
a series of X-ray diffraction studies of single crystals grown at low temperatures
from low melting liquids for which putative residual entropy problems

existed: N 2O 2, CH 3N H2, CH 3OH, N 2H 4, COCl 2 a n d H2O 2. The subsequent
low temperature studies of single crystals of these volatile and unstable boranes
were not without hazards. Vacuum line techniques were learned as we needed
them. Fortunately, no serious injuries were incurred as a result of several
explosions resulting from cracks in these vacuum systems. I was relieved, on
one occasion, when I had taken Russell Grimes to a hospital in Cambridge
after one of these explosions to hear the doctor tell me, “Louis Fieser sends me
much more interesting cases than you do.” I still have in my office the air gun
which I, or my young son, used on a number of occasions to destroy a cracked
vacuum system from a safe distance. We also had chemical surprises, for
example, when we found a presumed B 8 hydride to be B 9H 15 .21 Our only
chemical analysis of this compound was the count of the numbers of boron
and hydrogen atoms in the electron density map, which was calculated in
those days from rough visual estimates of intensities of diffraction maxima on
films.



THREE-CENTER BONDS AMONG BORON ATOMS
At the fortunate time in 1953 of W. H. Eberhardt’s sabbatical, he, Crawford
and I examined 22 the open boron hydrides B 2H 6, B4H 10, B5H 9, B5H 11 and B 10H 14
from the viewpoint of three-center bonds; and we studied B 5H 9, the unknown
polyhedral molecule B 4H 4, the then hypothetical ions B 6H 6 (Fig. 1) and
                                                                  -2



B 12H 12-2 (Fig. 2) from the viewpoint of molecular orbitals. Longuet-Higgins 23
also, independently, formed an early molecular orbital description almost like
ours. One of the simple consequences of these studies was that electron deficient
molecules, defined as having more valence orbitals than electrons, are not
really electron deficient. I mean by this non-sequitur that the three-center
two-electron bonds make possible a simple description of these molecules and
ions as filled orbital species. Filled molecular orbitals were later extended to
closed polyhedral compounds BnH n, for all values of n from 5 to 24, all of which
have a formal charge of -2, even though hypothetical B 4H 4 is neutral. In
fact, all of the experimentally known ions, for 6     n 12, do have -2 charge.

in addition to B 6 H 6 -2 (Fig. 1) and B 1 2 H 1 2 -2 (Fig. 2), those polyhedra for
5 n     10 are shown in Fig. 9. The isoelectronic series C 2B n-2 H n is known
for 5   n    12.
   Equations for the atom, orbital and electron balance were formulated in
our paper of 1954, allowing prediction of many new chemical species. One
simple form of these rules is exemplified for a neutral hydride formula B PH p+q
in which each boron atom has at least one terminal hydrogen atom. Define
the number of BHB bridges as s, the number of three-center BBB bonds as t,
the number of two-center BB bonds as y and the number of extra terminal
hydrogens on each BH unit as x. Then




The first equation is the hydrogen balance. The second comes from the fact
that each of the p boron atoms supplies four orbitals and only three electrons,
and the extra orbital is utilized in one of the two types of three-center bond.
Finally, if each BH unit is recognized as contributing a pair of electrons, these
p pairs are used in BBB or BB bonds, or in half of the pairs required for the
extra hydrogens, s and x. These rules, and the accompanying valence struc-
tures, are especially helpful in describing those polyboron compounds which
are open, but they are also useful for closed polyhedral molecules and ions.

    There are two kinds of three-center bonds among three boron atoms (Fig.
10). The central three-center bond involves positive overlap among hybrid
orbitals from each of three boron atoms, while the open three-center bond
involves, on the central atom, a π orbital which overlaps in a bonding manner
with an orbital from each of the adjacent boron atoms. The less compact
B 2 H 6 , B4 H 1 0 , B5 H 1 1 and B 6H 10 structures (Figs. 11-14) are well described

with the use of these three-center bonds, omitting open three-center BBB
bonds for the moment. However, B5H 9 (Fig. 15) requires a resonance hybrid
of four valence structures, related by the four-fold symmetry; and B 10H 14
(Fig. 16) requires a resonance hybrid of 24 valence structures.

                                work bonds by 90° about the molecular four-fold axis.




   Three-center bond theory was further developed in the following 22 years. 24
I realized that the valence rules implied the existence of a large body of boron
chemistry, and then ventured predictions, some of which were actually verified
experimentally. Dickerson 25 and I formalized my intuitive approach into a
theory of connectivity of various bonding patterns within the three-center
description. Also, geometrical constraints were introduced in order to avoid
overcrowding of hydrogen atoms and to preserve known bonding angles about
boron atoms among the boranes.26 More recently, Epstein27 and I reformulated
the topology using central three-center BBB bonds, to the exclusion of open
three-center BBB bonds. The recent work on localized molecular orbitals which
has led to the restriction of open three-center bonds, so far, to BCB bonds is
exemplified in a later part of this manuscript.



MOLECULAR ORBITAL STUDIES OF BORANES
Molecular orbitals are more appropriate for describing the valence structures
of the polyhedral molecules and ions, and the more compact polyhedral
fragments. Two simple examples will suffice. In B5H 9 there are three pairs of
electrons in the boron framework, which has four-fold symmetry. The bonding
is beautifully described without resonance, by a simple σ and π set of molecular
orbitals 22, 24, 28 (Fig. 17). These orbitals are similar to the bonding orbitals,
for example, between planar four-fold cyclobutadiene (C 4H 4) and a CH+
placed along the four-fold axis to give the carbonium ion C 5H 5+ .

    A similar σ, π situation occurs 28 if a BH unit is removed from icosahedral
B 1 2H 1 2-2 l e a v i n g B1 1H 1 1- 2 having five atomic orbitals containing four electrons
(Fig. 18). This set of five orbitals gives σ, π molecular orbitals which can bond
to a similar set of σ, π orbitals from another atom or group of atoms supplying
two more electrons. I suggested, conceptually, adding H3+ to predict B11H 14-,
for example. Although recognizing the similarity of this set of orbitals to those
in C5H 5, which was known to form ferrocene Fe(C5H 5) 2, I did not then go
quite so far as to suggest bonding of this B 1 1H 1 1 - fragment to a transition metal.

Later, Hawthorne did so, using these ideas as a starting point, and thereby
created the large family of metalloboranes and metallocarboranes 29 (Fig. 19).

to us, Roald Hoffmann and Lawrence Lohr independently programmed the

extended Hückel method in my research group. Its first application was to
boron chemistry, 30 where, particularly in the carboranes (compounds of boron,
carbon and hydrogen), the charge distributions predicted sites of electrophilic
and nucleophilic substitution. One of the rather simple rules which emerged
was that nucleophilic attack occurs in a polyhedral carborane at a boron atom
closest to carbon, while electrophilic attack was preferred at a boron furthest
removed from carbon. Experimental studies of boranes and carboranes in
which one or more hydrogens had been replaced by a halogen or by an amine
group confirmed these predictions. The extended Hückel method became for
a time the most widely used program for the study of molecular theory and
reactions in complex organic and inorganic molecules. For example, the
Woodward-Hoffmann rules, and related orbital concepts, were tested by their
inventors31 with the use of this theory.
   I thought then that progress in structure determination, for new polyborane
species and for substituted boranes and carboranes, would be greatly accelerated
if the 11B nuclear magnetic resonance spectra, rather than X-ray diffraction,
could be used. One approach was empirical, 32 while the other was purely
theoretical. This latter approach required the development of a theory for
fairly reliable calculation of chemical shifts of 11 B from first principles of
quantum mechanics. 33 This theory, the coupled Hartree-Fock method for a
molecule in a magnetic or electric field, yielded molecular constants good to a
few to several percent 34 for many diatomic molecules. A striking result was the
prediction of the paramagnetic nature of diatomic BH. 35 H o w e v e r , t h e
application of this method to the complex boranes still lies in the future, even
after 13 years of effort. While we understand some of the contributions to
chemical shift, diamagnetic and large temperature-independent paramagnetic
effects, the use of this method for structure determination of complex poly-
boranes is still somewhat limited.
   These programs yielded accurate self-consistent field molecular orbitals,
which were explored in other areas of chemistry, as well as in the boranes and
carboranes. One example is the first accurate calculation of the barrier to
internal rotation in ethane.36 At this point, my research students and I set out
to explore the gap between extended Hückel theory and self-consistent field
theory. We achieved by stages 37,38 a molecular orbital theory still being
                                                                    39



extended, which was applicable to large polyboranes and other molecules,
and which had essentially the accuracy of self-consistent field methods.
Molecular orbital methods which do not go beyond symmetry orbitals tend to
make each molecule a separate case. Hence we began only a few years ago to
explore the connections between these symmetry orbitals and the three-center
bonds of the previous section.



LOCALIZED MOLECULAR ORBITALS
Ordinarily, molecular orbitals are classified according to their symmetry types.
However, it is possible to make linear combinations of molecular orbitals of
different symmetries in such a way that the total electron density of the mole-

cule remains invariant. The most popular methods are those of Edmiston and
Ruedenberg 40 who maximize




and of Boys41 who minimizes




These procedures, respectively, maximize the repulsions of those electron pairs
within each molecular orbital, and minimize the orbital self-extension of each
electron pair. Thus, in slightly different manner, the symmetry orbitals are
converted into linear combinations which are a good approximation to the
localized electron-pair bond. These objective procedures, without adjustable
parameters, have been compared in some detail. 42 They provide support of
three-center bond descriptions within a theoretical chemical framework. Also,
they test the level at which two-center and three-center bonds require some
further delocalization. These studies have also provided preferred descriptions
of valence structures, often eliminating or reducing the need for resonance
hybrids.
    Open three-center and central three-center BBB bonds are almost equivalent
descriptions. Including both types there are 111 resonance structures for
B 10H 14, of which 24 are based only on central three-center bonds. In B 5H 11
(Fig. 20) two slightly unsymmetrical central three-center BBB bonds are

bond, (b) the symmetrical central three-center bonds, and (b’) the localized slightly un-
symmetrical three-center bonds. For clarity, one terminal B-H bond has been omitted at
each boron site in (a), (b) and (b’).

found 43 by both localization procedures (Fig. 20b’), whereas the open three-
center description is not favored. In a series of studies of localized molecular
orbitals in all of the boron hydrides, carboranes, and ions of known geometry,
we have never found an open three-center BBB bond. However, open three-
center BCB bonds do exist. For example, the open three-center BCB bond 44
o c c u r s t w i c e i n 1 , 2 - C2 B 4 H 6 ( F i g . 2 1 ) , when the Edmiston-Ruedenberg
procedure is used. A comparison of these results with those of the Boys procedure
is given below. In the simplest molecular orbital description of an open three-
center bond, the electron pair is distributed as e/2, e, e/2 among these three
atoms. It is probable that the extra nuclear charge of carbon stabilizes this
distribution, to give open three-center bonds rather than nearly equivalent
central three-center bonds, when carbon is the middle atom.
   Another new general result is that almost every single bond within a
triangulated borane or carborane framework shows some donation to the
nearest adjacent atoms (Fig. 22). This tendency for multi-centered bonding
usually involves 10 per cent or less of the electron pair. In B4H 10, about 0.2
e is donated 43 from the single BB bond to each of atoms B 1 and B 4, which
themselves are relatively electron deficient because of the open three-center
bonds of the hydrogen bridges (Fig. 23). This donation then causes these

generally, this donation causes electron withdrawal along other bonds in the

this electron displacement. Two additional examples are illustrated in B8H 13-
and in the predicted structure of B8H 14, respectively (Fig. 24 and 25). I have

   A new type of bonding, which is conceptually transferable among these
molecules, is described as fractional three-center bonds. 46 Its simplest inter-
pretation is the replacement of a pair of resonance structures by a single
valence structure (Fig. 27). The fractional use of orbitals, indicated by dotted
lines, increases the apparent number of bonds to a given boron above the usual
four, in an element in the first row of the periodic table. However, the Pauli
exclusion principle is not violated because less than a full atomic orbital is
required at a fractional bond. Indeed, the localized molecular orbitals are
themselves derived from wavefunctions for which the exclusion principle is
rigorously introduced. The use of fractional bonds to reduce the number of
resonance hybrids, often to a single preferred structure, is not limited to
boranes and their relatives. Our rather extensive studies of bonding among
atoms other than boron have indicated that these simplified localized molecular
orbitals may be an informative and useful alternative to the ‘more conventional
valence bond and molecular orbital descriptions in other parts of the periodic
table. A very simple example, carboxylate anion,47 is shown in Fig. 28.
   Fractional bonds to atom B2 in 4,5-C2B 4H 8 are preferred 48 over a resonance
hybrid of a single and a central three-center bond, and also are preferred over
the open three-center bond (Fig. 29). Also, the bonding of the two carbon atoms
in this carborane by both a single bond and a central three-center bond has
not been found in boranes, and, in particular, does not occur in B6H 10 which

is isoelectronic with 4,5-C2B 4H 8. Fractional bonds give a particularly simple
valence description45 of bonding in B 10H 14 (Fig. 30), where the single valence
structure (Fig. 30c) replaces a resonance hybrid of 24 central three-center bond
structures. A very similar simplification 45 occurs in B 10H 14-2, where the two
pairs offractional bonds are dotted toward atoms B2 and B4, rather than toward
B 6 and B 9.

   Similar pairs of fractional bonds are found by Boys’ localization procedure
i n t h e p o l y h e d r a l c a r b o r a n e s 1 , 2 - C2 B 4 H 6 ( F i g . 3 1 ) a n d 1 , 7 - C2 B 1 0H 1 2
(Fig. 32). Perhaps this procedure tends to exaggerate the separation of charge
centroids of bonds when they lie at or near a single center. For this reason, we
tend to prefer 42 the almost equivalent open three-center bonds, as found by
the Edmiston-Ruedenberg procedure in 1,2-C 2B 4H 6. When it becomes
economically feasible to test this alternative in 1,7-C2B 10H 12, I would guess
that localized open three-center bonds will be found, centered at carbon
atoms, in this molecule, like those in 1,2-C 2B 4H 6.




Fig. 32. A situation parallel to that of Fig. 31 may occur in 1,7-C 2 B 1 0 H 1 2 , where the Boys
localization (right side) shows fractional bonds. The open three-center bond description
may be found by the Edmiston-Ruedenberg procedure, if and when the calculations can
be made.


  Fractional three-center bonds are not always unique, particularly in
aromatic hydrocarbons, or in those boranes which have a valence pattern
similar to that in the aromatics. An example of this orientational ambiguity
occurs in the boron framework bonds in B5H 9 (Fig. 33). Actually, the two
valence structures represent extremes over a 45° range of orientation angle,
about the four-fold axis. There is a continuum of valence structures between
these extremes. Moreover, this ambiguity continues throughout the whole
      in accord with the four-fold symmetry which the electron density must
have in this molecule. All of these valence structures are equally preferred,
and each has a total electron density which is consistent with the four-fold
molecular symmetry.

   In more complex molecules one can find various degrees of simplicity in
the bonding patterns of localized molecular orbitals. In C 2 B 1 0 H 1 3 -, which has
a s o m e w h a t o p e n n e a r - i c o s a h e d r a l C2 B 10 a r r a n g e m e n t , t h e b o n d i n g i s e s -
pecially simple, 4 9 not requiring resonance or appreciable fractional bonding
(Fig. 34). In 1,2-C 2 B 1 0 H 1 2 , another simple idea occurs: the bonding, as found
by Boys’ procedure, is to a good approximation just like that in 1 , 7 - C2 B 10 , H12
in spite of the very different positions of the two carbon atoms relative to each
other and to their boron neighbors (Fig. 35). Thus there is some tendency for
bonding invariance in closely related geometrical structures. In iso-B 1 8 H 2 2

we find50 both single bond donation, from B 4B 8 a n d Bl4 H 18 , and fractional
bonds, to B6 and B 16 (Fig. 36). Here, the single bond donations are greater
toward B 9, which is relatively electron deficient, than toward B 3 and B13. In
B 20H 16 there is a remarkable amount of single-bond donation, particularly
toward the electron deficient B9-B 16 atoms, inclusive (Fig. 37) and the valence
structure of each half is clearly like that in B 10H 14-2 (Fig. 38) rather than like
that in B10 H 14 (Fig. 30).

a two-fold axis only, and no terminal hydrogen atoms on atoms B 9 and B 10 .




Fig. 37. Donation and non-donation localized orbitals are shown for B2 0 H 1 6 , in which the
four borons nearest the equatorial belt have no terminal hydrogens. Boron atoms B 4 B 1 6 ,
inclusive, are particulaly electron deficient, and receive substantial donation from single
bonds. Each of these eight boron atoms has only two framework bonds in the figure at the
right.

Fig. 38. A relationship similar to that in B 2 0 H 16 occurs in B 1 0 H 1 4 -2 . The preferred localized
orbital structure is shown on the left side, while the open three-center bond structure
without donation is an oversimplified valence structure.




Fig. 39. A rather complex pattern of localized orbitals is shown for B 16 H 20 . Bond donations
can be withdrawn by the reader in order to discover the preferred valence bond structures
of the simpler theory. This single valence structure replaces a resonance hybrid of 216
valence structures based upon central three-center bonds and single bonds. Atoms B 9 a n d
B 10 do not have terminal hydrogens.


  The rather complex localized molecular orbitals in B 16 H 20 (Fig. 39) are
dominated by the three-center bond approximation; in addition they are
modified by single bond donation accompanied by electron withdrawal from
atoms to which donation occurs . 50 With recognition that atoms B 9 a n d B10
have no terminal hydrogens attached to them, I offer the reader a challenge
to find the close relative valence structures which do not have fractional
bonding or single bond donation in this molecule.
  Finally, the bonding in reaction intermediates is a new area of study,
primarily by purely theoretical methods. In BH5 (Fig. 40) there is only a very
weak donor bond from H2 to the vacant orbital of BH3.51-55 This weakness is
probably due to the absence of a pathway for back donation. On the other

hand, in the dimerization of two BH3 molecules to form B2H 6, donation of
electron density from one terminal H to B of the other BH3 group is balanced
by a symmetrically related donation toward the first BH3 group 56 (Fig. 41).
Our other recent progress in theoretical studies of bonding in reaction inter-
mediates, such as B3H 7 and B4H 8, shows that the more stable transient species
may have a vacant orbital57 on one boron atom, because of the strain involved
when that vacant orbital is filled by converting a terminal BH bond to a

bridge BHB bond. Actually less is known of the detailed reaction mechanisms
for reactions of boranes and their related compounds than is known for
organic reactions of comparable complexity. Surely, this is a fruitful area for
future research.
    I shall stop here, omitting descriptions of bonding in large polyhedral borane
anions and other related compounds. Also, polyhedral rearrangements,
hydrogen atom tautomerism, and particularly the use of bonding theory in
bringing some degree of order to chemical transformations of the boranes have
been omitted. Attention has thus been concentrated on those aspects of
chemical bonding which have been especially illuminated by the molecular
and crystal structures that we and others have studied over these many years.
    My original intention in the late 1940’s was to spend a few years understand-
ing the boranes, and then to discover a systematic valence description of the
vast numbers of “electron deficient” intermetallic compounds. I have made
little progress toward this latter objective. Instead, the field of boron chemistry
has grown enormously, and a systematic understanding of some of its com-
plexities has now begun.
    It remains to give credits where they really belong, to my research associates:
graduate students, undergraduates, postdoctoral fellows and my other col-
leagues who have coauthored nearly all of these studies. For the figures of this
