It can’t have escaped you, after so many recent reminders, that this year
marks the one hundredth birthday of the light quantum. I thought I would
tell you this morning a few things about its century long biography. Of course
we have had light quanta on earth for eons, in fact ever since the good Lord
said “let there be quantum electrodynamics” – which is a modern translation,
of course, from the biblical Aramaic. So in this talk I’ll try to tell you what
quantum optics is about, but there will hardly be enough time to tell you of
the many new directions in which it has led us. Several of those are directions
that we would scarcely have anticipated as all of this work started.
   My own involvement in this subject began somewhere around the middle
of the last century, but I would like to describe some of the background of
the scene I entered at that point as a student. Let’s begin, for a moment,
even before the quantum theory was set in motion by Planck. It is important
to recall some of the remarkable things that were found in the 19th century,
thanks principally to the work of Thomas Young and Augustin Fresnel. They
established within the first 20 years of the 19th century that light is a wave
phenomenon, and that these waves, of whatever sort they might be, interpene-
trate one another like waves on the surface of a pond. The wave displace-
ments, in other words, add up algebraically. That’s called superposition,
and it was found thus that if you have two waves that remain lastingly in step
with one another, they can add up constructively, and thereby reinforce one
another in some places, or they can even oscillate oppositely to one another,
and thereby cancel one another out locally. That would be what we call de-
structive interference.
   Interference phenomena were very well understood by about 1820. On
the other hand it wasn’t at all understood what made up the underlying
waves until the fundamental laws of electricity and magnetism were gathered
together and augmented in a remarkable way by James Clerk Maxwell, who
developed thereby the electrodynamics we know today. Maxwell’s theory
showed that light waves consist of oscillating electric and magnetic fields.
The theory has been so perfect in describing the dynamics of electricity and
magnetism over laboratory scale distances, that it has remained precisely
intact. It has needed no fundamental additions in the years since the 1860’s,
apart from those concerning the quantum theory. It serves still, in fact, as the
basis for the discussion and analysis of virtually all the optical instrumenta-

tion we have ever developed. That overwhelming and continuing success
may eventually have led to a certain complacency. It seemed to imply that the
field of optics, by the middle of the 20th century, scarcely needed to take any
notice of the granular nature of light. Studying the behavior of light quanta
was then left to the atomic and elementary particle physicists – whose inter-
ests were largely directed toward other phenomena.
   The story of the quantum theory, of course, really begins with Max Planck.
Planck in 1900 was confronted with many measurements of the spectral
distribution of the thermal radiation that is given off by a hot object. It was
known that under ideally defined conditions, that is for complete (or black)
absorbers and correspondingly perfect emitters this is a unique radiation
distribution. The intensities of its color distribution, under such ideal condi-
tions, should depend only on temperature and not at all on the character
of the materials that are doing the radiating. That defines the so-called
black-body distribution. Planck, following others, tried finding a formula
that expresses the shape of that black-body color spectrum. Something of its
shape was known at low frequencies, and there was a good guess present for
its shape at high frequencies.
   The remarkable thing that Planck did first was simply to devise an empiri-
cal formula that interpolates between those two extremes. It was a relatively
simple formula and it involved one constant which he had to adjust in order
to fit the data at a single temperature. Then having done that, he found his
formula worked at other temperatures. He presented the formula to the
Germany Physical Society1 on October 19, 1900 and it turned out to be suc-
cessful in describing still newer data. Within a few weeks the formula seemed
to be established as a uniquely correct expression for the spectral distribu-
tion of thermal radiation.
   The next question obviously was: did this formula have a logical derivation
of any sort? There Planck, who was a sophisticated theorist, ran into a bit of
trouble. First of all he understood from his thermodynamic background that
he could base his discussion on nearly any model of matter, however oversim-
plified it might be, as long as it absorbed and emitted light efficiently. So he
based his model on the mechanical system he understood best, a collection
of one-dimensional harmonic oscillators, each of them oscillating rather like
a weight at the end of a spring. They had to be electrically charged. He knew
from Maxwell exactly how these charged oscillators interact with the electro-
magnetic field. They both radiate and absorb in a way he could calculate. So
then he ought to be able to find the equilibrium between these oscillators
and the radiation field, which acted as a kind of thermal reservoir – and
which he never made any claim to discuss in detail.
   He found that he could not secure a derivation for his magic formula for
the radiation distribution unless he made an assumption which, from a philo-
sophical standpoint, he found all but unacceptable. The assumption was that
the harmonic oscillators he was discussing had to possess energies that were
distributed, not as the continuous variables one expected, but confined in-
stead to discrete and regularly spaced values. The oscillators of frequency ν

76


would have to be restricted to energy values that were integer multiples, i.e.
n-fold multiples (with n = 0, 1, 2, 3…) of something he called the quantum
of energy, hν.
   That number h was, in effect, the single number that he had to introduce
in order to fit his magic formula to the observed data at a single tempera-
ture. So he was saying, in effect, that these hypothetical harmonic oscilla-
tors representing a simplified image of matter could have only a sequence
amounting to a “ladder” of energy states. That assumption permits us to see
immediately why the thermal radiation distribution must fall off rapidly with
rising frequency. The energy steps between the oscillator states grow larger,
according to his assumption, as you raise the frequency, but thermal excita-
tion energies, on the other hand, are quite restricted in magnitude at any
fixed temperature. High frequency oscillators at thermal equilibrium would
never even reach the first step of excitation. Hence there tends to be very
little high frequency radiation present at thermal equilibrium. Planck pre-
sented this revolutionary suggestion2 to the Physical Society on December
14, 1900, although he could scarcely believe it himself.
   The next great innovation came in 1905 from the young Albert Einstein,
employed still at the Bern Patent Office. Einstein first observed that Planck’s
formula for the entropy of the radiation distribution, when he examined its
high frequency contributions, looked like the entropy of a perfect gas of free
particles of energy hν. That was a suggestion that light itself might be discrete
in nature, but hardly a conclusive one.
   To reach a stronger conclusion he turned to an examination of the photo-
electric effect, which had first been observed in 1887 by Heinrich Hertz.
Shining monochromatic light on metal surfaces drives electrons out of the
metals, but only if the frequency of the light exceeds a certain threshold
value characteristic of each metal. It would have been most reasonable to
expect that as you shine more intense light on those metals the electrons
would come out faster, that is with higher velocities in response to the strong-
er oscillating electric fields – but they don’t. They come out always with the
same velocities, provided that the incident light is of a frequency higher than
the threshold frequency. If it were below that frequency there would be no
photoelectrons at all.
   The only response that the metals make to increasing the intensity of light
lies in producing more photoelectrons. Einstein had a naively simple expla-
nation for that.3 The light itself, he assumed, consists of localized energy
packets and each possesses one quantum of energy. When light strikes the
metal, each packet is absorbed by a single electron. That electron then flies
off with a unique energy, an energy which is just the packet energy hν minus
whatever energy the electron needs to expend in order to escape the metal.
   It took until about 1914–16 to secure an adequate verification of Einstein’s
law for the energies of the photoelectrons. When Millikan succeeded in doing
that, it seemed clear that Einstein was right, and that light does indeed consist
of quantized energy packets. It was thus Einstein who fathered the light quan-
tum, in one of the several seminal papers he wrote in the year 1905.

                                                                              77


  To follow the history a bit further, Einstein began to realize in 1909 that
his energy packets would have a momentum which, according to Maxwell,
should be their energy divided by the velocity of light. These presumably
localized packets would have to be emitted in single directions if they were
to remain localized, or to constitute “Nadelstrahlung” (needle radiation),
very different in behavior from the broadly continuous angular distribution
of radiation that would spread from harmonic oscillators according to the
Maxwell theory. A random distribution of these needle radiations could look
appropriately continuous, but what was disturbing about that was the ran-
domness with which these needle radiations would have to appear. That was
evidently the first of the random variables in the quantum theory that began
disturbing Einstein and kept nettling him for the rest of his life.
  In 1916 Einstein found another and very much more congenial way of
deriving Planck’s distribution by discussing the rate at which atoms radiate.
Very little was known about atoms at that stage save that they must be capable
of absorbing and giving off radiation. An atom lodged in a radiation field
would surely have its constituent charges shaken by the field oscillations,
and that shaking could lead either to the absorption of radiation or to the
emission of still more radiation. Those were the processes of absorption or
emission induced by the prior presence of radiation. But Einstein found that
thermal equilibrium between matter and radiation could only be reached if,
in addition to these induced processes, there exists also a spontaneous pro-
cess, one in which an excited atom emits radiation even in the absence of any
prior radiation field. It would be analogous to radioactive decays discovered
by Rutherford. The rates at which these processes take place were governed
by Einstein’s famous B and A coefficients respectively. The existence of spon-
taneous radiation turned out to be an important guide to the construction of
quantum electrodynamics.
  Some doubts about the quantized nature of light inevitably persisted,
but many of them were dispelled by Compton’s discovery in 1922 that x-ray
quanta are scattered by electrons according to the same rules as govern the
collisions of billiard balls. They both obey the conservation rules for energy
and momentum in much the same way. It became clear that the particle pic-
ture of light quanta, whatever were the dilemmas that accompanied it, was
here to stay.
  The next dramatic developments of the quantum theory, of course, took
place between the years 1924 and 1926. They had the effect of ascribing to
material particles such as electrons much of the same wave-like behavior as
had long since been understood to characterize light. In those developments
de Broglie, Heisenberg, Schrödinger and others accomplished literal mir-
acles in explaining the structure of atoms. But however much this invention
of modern quantum mechanics succeeded in laying the groundwork for a
more general theory of the structure of matter, it seemed at first to have little
new bearing on the understanding of electromagnetic phenomena. The
spontaneous emission of light persisted as an outstanding puzzle.
  Thus there remained a period of a couple of years more in which we de-

78


scribed radiation processes in terms that have usually been called “semiclas-
sical.” Now the term “classical” is an interesting one – because, as you know,
every field of study has its classics. Many of the classics that we are familiar
with go back two or three thousand years in history. Some are less old, but
all share an antique if not an ancient character. In physics we are a great deal
more precise, as well as contemporary. Anything that we understood or could
have understood prior to the date of Planck’s paper, December 14, 1900, is
to us “classical.” Those understandings are our classics. It is the introduction
of Planck’s constant that marks the transition from the classical era to our
modern one.
    The true “semiclassical era,” on the other hand, lasted only about two years.
It ended formally with the discovery4 by Paul Dirac that one must treat the
vacuum, that is to say empty space, as a dynamical system. The energy distrib-
uted through space in an electromagnetic field had been shown by Maxwell
to be a quadratic expression in the electric and magnetic field strengths.
Those quadratic expressions are formally identical in their structure to the
mathematical expressions for the energies of mechanical harmonic oscilla-
tors. Dirac observed that even though there may not seem to be any orga-
nized fields present in the vacuum, those mathematically defined oscillators
that described the field energy would make contributions that could not be
overlooked. The quantum mechanical nature of the oscillators would add an
important but hitherto neglected correction to the argument of Planck.
    Planck had said the energies of harmonic oscillators are restricted to values
n times the quantum energy, hν, and the fully developed quantum mechanics
had shown in fact that those energies are not nhν but (n + ½)hν. All of the in-
tervals between energy levels remained unchanged, but the quantum mech-
anical uncertainty principle required that additional ½ hν to be present. We
can never have a harmonic oscillator completely empty of energy because
that would require its position coordinate and its momentum simultaneously
to have the precise values zero.
    So, according to Dirac, the electromagnetic field is made up of field am-
plitudes that can oscillate harmonically. But these amplitudes, because of the
ever-present half quantum of energy ½ hν, can never be permanently at rest.
They must always have their fundamental excitations, the so-called “zero-
point fluctuations” going on. The vacuum then is an active dynamical system.
It is not empty. It is forever buzzing with weak electromagnetic fields. They
are part of the ground state of emptiness. We can withdraw no energy at all
from those fluctuating electromagnetic fields. We have to regard them none-
theless as real and present even though we are denied any way of perceiving
them directly.
    An immediate consequence of this picture was the unification of the notions
of spontaneous and induced emission. Spontaneous emission is emission in-
duced by those zero-point oscillations of the electromagnetic field. Furthermore
it furnishes, in a sense, an indirect way of perceiving the zero-point fluctuations
by amplifying them. Quantum amplifiers tend to generate background noise
that consists of radiation induced by those vacuum fluctuations.

                                                                                79


   It is worth pointing out a small shift in terminology that took place in the
late 1920’s. Once material particles were found to exhibit some of the wave-
like behavior of light quanta, it seemed appropriate to acknowledge that
the light quanta themselves might be elementary particles, and to call them
“photons” as suggested by G. N. Lewis in 1926. They seemed every bit as
discrete as material particles, even if their existence was more transitory, and
they were at times freely created or annihilated.
   The countless optical experiments that had been performed by the middle
of the 20th century were in one or another way based on detecting only the
intensity of light. It may even have seemed there wasn’t anything else worth
measuring. Furthermore those measurements were generally made with
steady light beams traversing passive media. It proved quite easy therefore
to describe those measurements in simple and essentially classical terms. A
characteristic first mathematical step was to split the expression for the oscil-
lating electric field E into two complex conjugate terms
           E = E(+) + E(–),                                                   (1)
           E(–) = (E(+))*,                                                    (2)
with the understanding that E(+) contains only positive frequency terms, i.e.
those varying as e – iω t for all ω > 0, and E(–) contains only negative frequency
terms e i ωt . This is a separation familiar to electrical engineers and motivated
entirely by the mathematical convenience of dealing with exponential func-
tions. It has no physical motivation in the context of classical theory, since
the two complex fields E(±) are physically equivalent. They furnish identical
descriptions of classical theory.
   Each of the fields E(±)(rt) depends in general on both the space coordinate
r and time t. The instantaneous field intensity at r,t would then be
           | E(+)(r,t) | 2 = E(–)(r,t)E(+)(r,t).                              (3)
In practice it was always an average intensity that was measured, usually a
time average.
   The truly ingenious element of many optical experiments, going all the
way back to Young’s double-pinhole experiment, was the means their design
afforded to superpose the fields arriving at different space-time points before
the intensity observations were made. Thus in Young’s experiment, shown in
Figure 1, light penetrating a single pinhole in the first screen passes through
two pinholes in the second screen and then is detected as it falls on a third
screen. The field E(+)(rt) at any point on the latter screen is the superposition
of two waves radiated from the two prior pinholes with a slight difference in
their arrival times at the third screen, due to the slightly different distances
they have to travel.
   If we wanted to discuss the resulting light intensities in detail we would
find it most convenient to do that in terms of a field correlation function
which we shall define as
           G(1)(r1t1, r2t2) =     E(–)(r1t1)E(+)(r2t2)   .                    (4)

Figure 1. Young’s experiment. Light passing through a pinhole in the first screen falls on
two closely spaced pinholes in a second screen. The superposition of the waves radiated
by those pinholes at r1 and r2 leads to interference fringes seen at points r on the third
screen.




This is a complex-valued function that depends, in general, on both space-
time points r1t1 and r2t2. The angular brackets ... indicate that an average
value is somehow taken, as we have noted. The average intensity of the field
at the single point rt is then just G(1)(rt,rt).
   If the field E(+)(rt) at any point on the third screen is given by the sum of
two fields, i.e. proportional to E(+)(r1t1) + E(+)(r2t2), then it is easy to see that
the average intensity at rt on the screen is given by a sum of four correlation
functions,
             G(1)(r1t1r1t1) + G(1)(r2t2r2t2) + G(1)(r1t1r2t2) + G(1)(r2t2r1t1).       (5)
The first two of these terms are the separate contributions of the two pin-
holes in the second screen, that is, the intensities they would contribute indi-
vidually if each alone were present. Those smooth intensity distributions are
supplemented however by the latter two terms of the sum, which represent
the characteristic interference effect of the superposed waves. They are the
terms that lead to the intensity fringes observed by Young.
   Intensity fringes of that sort assume the greatest possible contrast or visibil-
ity when the cross correlation terms like G(1)(r1t1r2t2) are as large in magni-
tude as possible. But there is a simple limitation imposed on the magnitude
of such correlations by a familiar inequality. There is a formal sense in which
cross correlation functions like G(1)(r1t1r2t2) are analogous to the scalar prod-
ucts of two vectors and are thus subject to a Schwarz inequality. The squared
absolute value of that correlation function can then never exceed the prod-
uct of the two intensities. If we let x abbreviate a coordinate pair r,t, we must
have
             | G(1)(x1x2) | 2   ≤ G(1)(x1x1)G(1)(x2x2).                               (6)
The upper bound to the cross-correlation is attained if we have
             | G(1)(x1x2) | 2 = G(1)(x1x1)G(1)(x2x2),                                 (7)
and with it we achieve maximum fringe contrast. We shall then speak of the

                                                                                         81


fields at x1 and x2 as being optically coherent with one another. That is the
definition of relative coherence that optics has traditionally used.5
   There is another way of stating the condition for optical coherence that
is also quite useful, particularly when we are discussing coherence at pairs
of points extending over some specified region in space-time. Let us assume
that it is possible to find a positive frequency field ε(rt) satisfying the appro-
priate Maxwell equations and such that the correlation function (4) factor-
izes into the form
           G(1)(r1t1,r2t2) = ε*(r1t1)ε(r2t2).                                 (8)
While the necessity of this factorization property requires a bit of proof, 6 it
is at least clear that it does bring about the optical coherence that we have
defined by means of the upper bound in the inequality (6) since in that case
we have
           | G(1)(r1 t1r2 t2) | 2 = | ε(r1t1) | 2 | ε(r2t2) | 2.              (9)
   In the quantum theory, physical variables such as E(+–)(rt) are associated,
not with simple complex numbers, but with operators on the Hilbert-space
vectors        that represent the state of the system, which in the present case
is the electromagnetic field. Multiplication of the operators E(+)(r1t1) and
E(–)(r2t2) is not in general commutative, and the two operators can be dem-
onstrated to act in altogether different ways on the vectors      that represent
                                         (+)
the state of the field. The operator E , in particular, can be shown to be an
annihilation operator. It lowers by one the number of quanta present in the
field. Applied to an n-photon state, n , it reduces it to an n – 1 photon state,
 n − 1 . Further applications of E(+)(rt) keep reducing the number of quanta
present still further, but the sequence must end with the n = 0 or vacuum
state, | vac 〉, in which there are no quanta left. In that state we must finally
have
           E(+)(rt) | vacc = 0.                                              (10)
                                 (+)              (–)
  The operator adjoint to E , which is E must have the property of raising
an n-photon state to an n + 1 photon state, so we may be sure, for example,
that the state E(–)(rt) | vac is a one-photon state. Since the vacuum state can
not be reached by raising the number of photons, we must also require the
relation
               vvac | E(–)(rt) = 0,                                          (11)
which is adjoint to Eq. (10).
  The results of quantum measurements often depend on the way in which
the measurements are carried out. The most useful and informative ways of
discussing such experiments are usually those based on the physics of the
measurement process itself. To discuss measurements of the intensity of light
then we should understand the functioning of the device that detects or
counts photons.
  Such devices generally work by absorbing quanta and registering each

82


such absorption process, for example, by the detection of an emitted photo-
electron. We need not go into any of the details of the photoabsorption
process to see the general nature of the expression for the photon counting
probability. All we need to assume is that our idealized detector at the point
r has negligibly small size and has a photo-absorption probability that is in-
dependent of frequency so that it can be regarded as probing the field at a
well-defined time t. Then if the field makes a transition from an initial state
 i to a final state f in which there is one photon fewer, the probability
amplitude for that particular transition is given by the scalar product – or
matrix element

             f E(+)(rt) i .                                                  (12)

To find the total transition probability we must find the squared modulus of
this amplitude and sum it over the complete set of possible final states f
for the field. The expression for the completeness of the set of states f is

           ∑f
                     f       f      = 1,

so that we then have a total transition probability proportional to

           ∑f
                 | f E(+)(rt) i | 2 =      ∑
                                           f
                                               i E(–)(rt) f   f E(+)(rt) i

           = i E(–)(rt)E(+)(rt) i .                                          (13)
   It is worth repeating here that in the quantum theory the fields E(+–) are
non-commuting operators rather than simple numbers. Thus one could not
reverse their ordering in the expression (13) while preserving its meaning.
In the classical theory we discussed earlier E(+) and E(–) are simple numbers
that convey equivalent information. There is no physical distinction between
photo-absorption and emission since there are no classical photons. The fact
that the quantum energy hν vanishes for h → 0 removes any distinction be-
tween positive and negative values of the frequency variable.
   The initial state of the field in our photon counting experiment depends,
of course, on the output of whatever light source we use, and very few sources
produce pure quantum states of any sort. We must thus regard the state i
as depending in general on some set of random and uncontrollable param-
eters characteristic of the source. The counting statistics we actually measure
then may vary from one repetition of the experiment to another. The figure
we would quote must be regarded as the average taken over these repetitions.
The neatest way of specifying the random properties of the state i is to de-
fine what von Neumann called the density operator
           ρ=   {i       i   }av,                                            (14)
which is the statistical average of the outer product of the vector i with
itself. That expression permits us to write the average of the counting prob-
ability as

                                                                              83


           {   i E(–)(rt)E(+)(rt) i       }av = Trace{ρE(–)(rt)E(+)rt)}.    (15)
   Interference experiments like those of Young and Michelson, as we have
noted earlier, often proceed by measuring the intensities of linear combina-
tions of the fields characteristic of two different space-time points. To find
the counting probability in a field like E(+)(r1t1) + E(+)(r2t2), for example, we
will need to know expressions like that of Eq. (15) but with two different
space-time arguments r1t1 and r2t2. It is convenient then to define the quan-
tum theoretical form of the correlation functions (4) as
                                      {
           G(1)(r1t1r2t2) = Trace ρE(–)(r1t1)E(+)(r2t2) .    }              (16)
This function has the same scalar product structure as the classical function
(4) and can be shown likewise to obey the inequality (6). Once again we can
take the upper bound of the modulus of this cross-correlation function or
equivalently the factorization condition (8) to define optical coherence.
   It is worth noting at this point that optical experiments aimed at achieving
a high degree of coherence have almost always accomplished it by using the
most nearly monochromatic light attainable. The reason for that is made
clear by the factorization condition (8). These experiments were always
based on steady or statistically stationary light sources. What we mean by a
steady state is that the function G(1) with two different time arguments, t1 and
t2, can in fact only depend on their difference t1–t2. Optical coherence then
requires
           G(1)(t1 – t2) = ε*(t1)ε(t2).                                     (17)
The only possible solution of such a functional equation for the function
ε(t) is one that oscillates with a single positive frequency. The requirement
of monochromaticity thus follows from the limitation to steady sources. The
factorization condition (8), on the other hand, defines optical coherence
more generally for non-steady sources as well.
  Although the energies of visible light quanta are quite small on the every-
day scale, techniques for detecting them individually have existed for many
decades. The simplest methods are based on the photoelectric effect and the
use of electron photomultipliers to produce well defined current pulses. The
possibility of detecting individual quanta raises interesting questions con-
cerning their statistical distributions, distributions that should in principle
be quite accessible to measurement. We might imagine, for example, putting
a quantum counter in a given light beam and asking for the distribution of
time intervals between successive counts. Statistical problems of that sort
were never, to my knowledge, addressed until the importance of quantum
correlations began to become clear in the 1950’s. Until that time virtually all
optical experiments measured only average intensities or quantum counting
rates, and the correlation function G(1) was all we needed to describe them. It
was in that decade, however, that several new sorts of experiments requiring a
more general approach were begun. That period seemed to mark the begin-
ning of quantum optics as a relatively new or rejuvenated field.

   In the experiment I found most interesting, R. Hanbury Brown and R. Q.
Twiss developed a new form of interferometry.7 They were interested at first
in measuring the angular sizes of radio wave sources in the sky and found
they could accomplish that by using two antennas, as shown in Figure 2, with
a detector attached to each of them to remove the high-frequency oscilla-
tions of the field. The noisy low frequency signals that were left were then
sent to a central device that multiplied them together and recorded their
time-averaged values. Each of the two detectors then was producing an out-
put proportional to the square of the incident field, and the central device
was recording a quantity that was quartic in the field strengths.
   It is easy to show, by using classical expressions for the field strengths,
that the quartic expression contains a measurable interference term, and
by exploiting it Hanbury Brown and Twiss did measure the angular sizes
of many radio sources. They then asked themselves whether they couldn’t
perform the same sort of “intensity interferometry” with visible light, and
thereby measure the angular diameters of visible stars. Although it seemed
altogether logical that they could do that, the interference effect would have
to involve the detection of pairs of photons and they were evidently inhibited
in imagining the required interference effect by a statement Dirac makes in
the first chapter of his famous textbook on quantum mechanics.8 In it he is
discussing why one sees intensity fringes in the Michelson interferometer,

achieved by varying the distance of the detector D2 from the mirror.




and says in ringingly clear terms “Each photon then interferes only with it-
self. Interference between two different photons never occurs.”
   It is worth recalling at this point that interference simply means that the
probability amplitudes for alternative and indistinguishable histories must be
added together algebraically. It is not the photons that interfere physically,
it is their probability amplitudes that interfere – and probability amplitudes
can be defined equally well for arbitrary numbers of photons.
   Evidently Hanbury Brown and Twiss remained uncertain on this point
and undertook an experiment9 to determine whether pairs of photons can
indeed interfere. Their experimental arrangement is shown in Figure 3. The
light source is an extremely monochromatic discharge tube. The light from
that source is collimated and sent to a half-silvered mirror which sends the
separated beams to two separate photo-detectors. The more or less random
output signals of those two detectors are multiplied together, as they were in
the radiofrequency experiments, and then averaged. The resulting averages
showed a slight tendency for both of the photo-detectors to register photons
simultaneously (Figure 4). The effect could be removed by displacing one
of the counters and thus introducing an effective time delay between them.
The coincidence effect thus observed was greatly weakened by the poor time
resolution of the detectors, but it raised considerable surprise nonetheless.
The observation of temporal correlations between photons in a steady beam
was something altogether new. The experiment has been repeated several
times, with better resolution, and the correlation effect has emerged in each
case more clearly.10
   The correlation effect was enough of a surprise to call for a clear explana-
tion. The closest it came to that was a clever argument11 by Purcell who used
the semi-classical form of the radiation theory in conjunction with a formula
for the relaxation time of radiofrequency noise developed in wartime radar

Figure 4. The photon coincidence rate measured rises slightly above the constant back-
ground of accidental coincidences for sufficiently small time delays. The observed rise was
actually weakened in magnitude and extended over longer time delays by the relatively
slow response of the photo-detectors. With ideal detectors it would take the more sharply
peaked form shown.




studies. It seemed to indicate that the photon correlation time would be in-
creased by just using a more monochromatic light source.
   The late 1950’s were, of course, the time in which the laser was being
developed, but it was not until 1960 that the helium-neon laser12 was on the
scene with its extremely monochromatic and stable beams. The question
then arose: what are the correlations of the photons in a laser beam? Would
they extend, as one might guess, over much longer time intervals as the beam
became more monochromatic? I puzzled over the question for some time, I
must admit, since it seemed to me, even without any detailed theory of the
laser mechanism, that there would not be any such extended correlation.
   The oscillating electric current that radiates light in a laser tube is not a
current of free charges. It is a polarization current of bound charges oscil-
lating in a direction perpendicular to the axis of the tube (Figure 5). If it is
sufficiently strong it can be regarded as a predetermined classical current,
one that suffers negligible recoil when individual photons are emitted. Such
currents, I knew,13 emitted Poisson distributions of photons, which indicated
clearly that the photons were statistically independent of one another. It
seemed then that a laser beam would show no Hanbury Brown-Twiss photon
correlations at all.
   How then would one describe the delayed-coincidence counting measure-
ment of Hanbury Brown and Twiss? If the two photon counters are sensitive
at the space-time points r1t1 and r2t2 we will need to make use of the annihila-
tion operators E(+)(r1t1) and E(+)(r2t2)(which do, in fact commute). The amp-
litude for the field to go from the state i to a state f with two quanta
fewer is
               f   E(+)(r2t2)E(+)(r1t1) i .                                          (18)

over the initial states i we have a new kind of correlation function that we
can write as
             G(2)(r1t1r2t2r2t2r1t1) = Trace{ρE(–)(r1t1)E(–)(r2t2)E(+)(r2t2)E(+)(r1t1)}.
                                                                                    (19)
This is a special case of a somewhat more general second order correlation
function that we can write (with the abbreviation xj = rjtj) as
             G(2)(x1x2x3x4) = Trace{ρE(–)(x1)E(–)(x2)E(+)(x3)E(+)(x4)}.                (20)
Now Hanbury Brown and Twiss had seen to it that the beams falling on their
two detectors were as coherent as possible in the usual optical sense. The
function G(1) should thus have satisfied the factorization condition (8), but
that statement doesn’t at all imply any corresponding factorization property
of the functions G(2) given by Eqs. (19) or (20).
  We are free to define a kind of second-order coherence by requiring a
parallel factorization of G(2),
             G(2)(x1x2x3x4) = ε*(x1)ε*(x2)ε(x3)ε(x4),                                  (21)
and the definition can be a useful one even though the Hanbury Brown-
Twiss correlation assures us that no such factorization is present in their ex-
periment. If it were present the coincidence rate according to Eq. (21) would
be proportional to
             G(2)(x1x2x2x1) = G(1)(x1x1) G(1)(x2x2),                                   (22)
that is, to the product of the two average intensities measured separately
– and that is what was not found. Ordinary light beams, that is, light from
ordinary sources, even extremely monochromatic ones as in the Hanbury
Brown-Twiss experiment, do not have any such second order coherence.
   We can go on defining still higher-order forms of coherence by defining
n-th order correlation functions G(n) that depend on 2n space-time coordi-
nates. The usefulness of such functions may not be clear since carrying out
the n-fold delayed coincidence counting experiments that measure them
would be quite difficult in practice. It is nonetheless useful to discuss such
functions since they do turn out to play an essential role in most calculations
of the statistical distributions of photons. If we turn on a photon counter for

88


any given length of time, for example, the number of photons it records will
be a random integer. Repeating the experiment many times will lead us to
a distribution function for that number. To predict those distributions14 we
need, in general, to know the correlation functions G(n) of arbitrary orders.
  Once we are defining higher order forms of coherence, it is worth asking
whether we can find fields that lead to factorization of the complete set of
correlation functions G(n). If so, we could speak of those as possessing full
coherence. Now, are there any such states of the field? In fact there are lots
of them, and some can describe precisely the fields generated by predeter-
mined classical current distributions. These fields have the remarkable prop-
erty that annihilating a single quantum in them by means of the operator E(+)
leaves the field essentially unchanged. It just multiplies the state vector by an
ordinary number. That is a relation we can write as
           E(+)(rt)    = ε(rt)     ,                                        (23)
where ε(rt) is a positive frequency function of the space-time point rt. It is
immediately clear that such states must have indefinite numbers of quanta
present. Only in that way can they remain unchanged when one quantum is
removed. This remarkable relation does in fact hold for all of the quantum
states radiated by a classical current distribution, and in that case the func-
tion ε(rt) happens to be the classical solution for the electric field.
   Any state vector that obeys the relation (23) will also obey the adjoint rela-
tion
               E(–)(rt) = ε*(rt)       .                                    (24)
Hence the n-th order correlation function will indeed factorize into the
form
           G(n)(x1….x2n) = ε*(x1)….ε*(xn)ε(xn+1)….ε(x2n)                    (25)
that we require for n-th order coherence. Such states represent fully coher-
ent fields, and delayed coincidence counting measurements carried out in
them will reveal no photon correlations at all. To explain, for example, the
Hanbury Brown-Twiss correlations we must use not pure coherent states but
mixtures of them, for which the factorization conditions like Eq. (25) no
longer hold. To see how these mixtures arise, it helps to discuss the modes of
oscillation of the field individually.
   The electromagnetic field in free space has a continuum of possible
frequencies of oscillation, and a continuum of available modes of spatial
oscillation at any given frequency. It is often simpler, instead of discussing
all these modes at once, to isolate a single mode and discuss the behavior of
that one alone. The field as a whole is then a sum of the contributions of the
individual modes. In fact when experiments are carried out within reflecting
enclosures the field modes form a discrete set, and their contributions are
often physically separable.
   The oscillations of a single mode of the field, as we have noted earlier, are
essentially the same as those of a harmonic oscillator. The n-th excitation

                                                                              89


state of the oscillator represents the presence of exactly n light quanta in that
mode. The operator that decreases the quantum number of the oscillator
is usually written as a , and the adjoint operator – which raises the quantum
number by one unit as a †. These operators then obey the relation
            a a † – a † a = 1,                                                 (26)
which shows that their multiplication is not commutative. We can take the
field operator E(+)(rt) for the mode we are studying to be proportional to the
operator a. Then any state vector for the mode that obeys the relation (23)
will have the property
            a        =α                                                        (27)
where α is some complex number. It is not difficult to solve for the state
vectors that satisfy the relation (27) for any given value of α. They can be
expressed as a sum taken over all possible quantum-number states n , n = 0,
1, 2…. that takes the form

in which we have chosen to label the state with the arbitrary complex param-
eter α. The states α are fully coherent states of the field mode.
   The squared moduli of the coefficients of the states n in Eq. (28) tell us
the probability for the presence of n quanta in the mode, and those numbers
do indeed form a Poisson distribution, one with the mean value of n equal to
| α |2. The coherent states form a complete set of states in the sense that any
state of the mode can be expressed as a suitable sum taken over them. As we
have defined them they are equivalent to certain oscillator states defined by
Schrödinger15 in his earliest discussions of wave functions. Known thus from
the very beginning of wave mechanics, they seemed not to have found any
important role in the earlier development of the theory.
   Coherent excitations of fields have a particularly simple way of combining.
Let us suppose that one excitation mechanism brings a field mode from its
empty state 0 to the coherent state α1 . A second mechanism could bring
it, for example, from the state 0 to the state α 2 . If the two mechanisms
act simultaneously the resulting state can be written as e iϕ α1 + α 2 where e iϕ is
a phase factor that depends on α1 and α2 , but we don’t need to know it since
it cancels out of the expression for the density operator
            ρ=     α1+ α2               α1 + α2   .                            (29)
This relation embodies the superposition principle for field excitations and
tells us all about the resulting quantum statistics. It is easily generalized to
treat the superposition of many excitations. If, say, j coherent excitations
were present, we should have a density operator
            ρ = α1 + ... + α j      α1 + ... + α j .                           (30)
  Let us suppose now that the individual excitation amplitudes αj are in one

   There is something remarkably universal about the geometrical sequence
of n-quantum probabilities. The image of chaotic excitation we have derived it
from, on the other hand, excitation in effect by a random collection of lasers,
may well seem rather specialized. It may be useful therefore to have a more
general way of characterizing the same distribution. If a quantum state is speci-
fied by the density operator ρ, we may associate with it an entropy S given by
           S = -Trace(ρ log ρ),                                             (34)
which is a measure, roughly speaking, of the disorder characteristic of the
state. The most disordered, or chaotic, state is reached by maximizing S, but
in finding the maximum we must observe two constraints. The first is
           Trace ρ = 1,                                                     (35)
which says simply that all probabilities add up to one. The second is

which fixes the average occupation number of the mode.
   When S is maximized, subject to these two constraints, we find indeed that
the density operator ρ takes the form given by Eq. (33). The geometrical dis-
tribution is thus uniquely representative of chaotic excitation. Most ordinary
light sources consist of vast numbers of atoms radiating as nearly indepen-
dently of one another as the field equations will permit. It should be no sur-
prise then that these are largely maximum entropy or chaotic sources. When
many modes are excited, the light they radiate is, in effect, colored noise and
indistinguishable from appropriately filtered black body radiation.
   For chaotic sources, the density operator (32) permits us to evaluate all of
the higher order correlation functions G(n)(x1…x2n). In fact they can all be
reduced14 to sums of products of first order correlation functions G(1)(xixj).
In particular, for example, the Hanbury Brown-Twiss coincidence rate corre-
sponding to the two space time points x1 and x2 can be written as
           G(2)(x1x2x2x1) = G(1)(x1x1)G(1)(x2x2) + G(1)(x1x2)G(1)(x2x1).    (37)
The first of the two terms on the right side of this equation is simply the
product of the two counting rates that would be measured at x1 and x2 in-
dependently. The second term is the additional delayed coincidence rate
detected first by Hanbury Brown and Twiss, and it is indeed contributed by
a two-photon interference effect. If we let x1 = x2, which corresponds to zero
time delay in their experiment, we see that
           G(2)(x1x1x1x1) = 2{G(1)(x1x1)}2,                                 (38)
or the coincidence rate for vanishing time delay should be double the back-
ground or accidental rate.
   The Gaussian representation of the density operator in terms of coherent
states is an example of a broader class of so-called “diagonal representations”
that are quite convenient to use – when they are available. If the density op-
erator for a single mode, for example, can be written in the form

             ρ=   ∫   P(α) α       α d 2α                                             (39)
then the expectation values of operator products like a†nam can be evaluated
as simple integrals over the function P such as
             {a†nam}av =   ∫   P(α)α*nαmd 2 α.                                        (40)
The function P(α) then takes on some of the role of a probability density,
but that can be a bit misleading since the condition that the probabilities
derived from ρ all be positive or zero does not require P(α) to be positive
definite. It can and sometimes does take on negative values over limited areas
of the α-plane in certain physical examples, and it may also be singular. It is a
member, as we shall see, of a broader class of quasi-probability densities. The
representation (39), the P-representation, unfortunately is not always avail-
able.16,17 It can not be defined, for example, for the familiar “squeezed” states
of the field in which one or the other of the complementary uncertainties is
smaller than that of the coherent states.
   The difference between a monochromatic laser beam and a chaotic beam
is most easily expressed in terms of the function P(α). For a stationary laser
beam the function P depends only on the magnitude of α and vanishes un-
less α assumes some fixed value. A graph of that function P is shown in
Figure 7, where it can be compared with the Gaussian function for the same
mean occupation number n given by Eq. (31).
   How do we measure the statistical properties of photon distributions? A
relatively simple way is to place a photon counter in a light beam behind ei-
ther a mechanical or an electrical shutter. If we open the shutter for a given
length of time t, the counter will register some random number n of pho-
tons. By repeating that measurement sufficiently many times we can establish
a statistical distribution for those random integers n. The analysis necessary
to derive this distribution mathematically can be a bit complicated since it re-

quires, in general, a knowledge of all the higher order correlation functions.
Experimental measurements of the distribution, conversely, can tell us about
those correlation functions.
  For the two cases in which we already know all the correlation functions, it is
particularly easy to find the photocount distributions. If the average rate at which
photons are recorded is w, then the mean number recorded in time t is
             n = wt .
In a coherent beam the result for the probability of n photocounts is just the
Poisson distribution
                      (wt)n –wt
            pn(t) =        e .                                                   (41)
                       n!
In a chaotic beam, on the other hand, the probability of counting n quanta is
given by the rather more spread-out distribution

                                             n
            pn(t) =

These results, which are fairly obvious from the occupation number prob-
abilities implicit in Eqs. (28) and (33), are illustrated in Figure 8.
   Here is a closely related question that can also be investigated experimen-
tally without much difficulty. If we open the shutter in front of the counter
at an arbitrary moment, some random interval of time will pass before the
first photon is counted. What is the distribution of those random times? In a
steady coherent beam, in fact, it is just an exponential distribution
            Wcoh = we – wt ,                                                     (43)
while in a chaotic beam it assumes the less obvious form

            Wch(t) =

  There is an alternative way of finding a distribution of time intervals.
Instead of simply opening a shutter at an arbitrary moment, we can begin the

measurement with the registration of a given photocount at time zero and
then ask what is the distribution, of time intervals until the next photocount.
This distribution, which we may write as W(0 | t), takes the same form for a
coherent beam as it does for the measurement described earlier, which starts
at arbitrary moments,
            Wcoh(0 | t) = we–wt = Wcoh(t).                                      (45)
This identity is simply a restatement of the statistically independent or uncor-
related quality of all photons in a coherent beam.
  For a chaotic beam, on the other hand, the distribution Wch(o | t) takes a
form quite different from Wch(t). It is

            Wch(0 | t) =
                              2w
                                       ,                                        (46)
                           (1 + wt)3

an expression which exceeds Wch(t) for times for which wt < 1, and is in fact
twice as large as Wch(t) for t = 0 (Figure 9). The reason for that lies in the
Gaussian distribution of amplitudes implicit in Eqs. (31) and (32). The very
fact that we have counted a photon at t = 0 makes it more probable that
the field amplitude α has fluctuated to a large value at that moment, and hence
the probability for counting a second photon remains larger than average for
some time later. The functions Wch(t) and Wch(0 | t) are compared in Figure 8.
   All of the experiments we have discussed thus far are based on the proce-
dure of photon counting, whether with individual counters or with several
of them arranged to be sensitive in delayed coincidence. The functions they
measure, the correlation functions G(n), are all expectation values of products
of field operators written in a particular order. If one reads from right to left,
the annihilation operator always precedes the creation operators in our corre-
lation functions, as they do, for example, in Eq. (19) for G(2). It is that so-called
“normal ordering” that gives the coherent states, and the quasiprobability den-
sity P(α) the special roles they occupy in discussing this class of experiments.
   But there are other kinds of expectation values that one sometimes needs
in order to discuss other classes of experiments. These could, for example,
involve symmetrically ordered sums of operator products, or even anti-nor-

                                                                                   95


mally ordered products which are opposite to the normally ordered ones.
The commutation relations for the multiplication of field operators will ulti-
mately relate all these expectation values to one another, but it is often pos-
sible to find much simpler ways of evaluating them. There exists a quasiprob-
ability density that plays much the same role for symmetrized products as
the function P does for the normally ordered ones. It is, in fact, the function
Wigner18 devised in 1932 as a kind of quantum mechanical replacement for
the classical phase space density. For anti-normally ordered operator prod-
ucts, the role of the quasiprobability density is taken over by the expectation

                                    1
value which for a single mode is      α ρ α . The three quasiprobability
                                    π
densities associated with the three operator orderings and whatever experi-
ments they describe are all members of a larger family that can be shown to
have many properties in common.17
   The developments I have described to you were all relatively early ones
in the development of the field we now call quantum optics. The further
developments that have come in rapid succession in recent years are too nu-
merous to recount here. Let me just mention a few. A great variety of careful
measurements of photon counting distributions and correlations of the type
we have discussed have been carried out19 and furnish clear agreement with
the theory. They have furthermore shown in detail how the properties of la-
ser beams change as they rise in power from below threshold to above it.
   The fully quantum mechanical theory of the laser was difficult to develop20
since the laser is an intrinsically nonlinear device, but only through such a
theory can its quantum noise properties be understood. The theories of a
considerable assortment of other kinds of oscillators and amplifiers have now
been worked out.
   Nonlinear optics has furnished us with new classes of quantum phenom-
ena such as parametric down conversion in which a single photon is split into
a pair of highly correlated or entangled photons. Entanglement has been a
rich source of the quantum phenomena that are perhaps most interesting
– and baffling – in everyday terms.
   It is worth emphasizing that the mathematical tools we have developed for
dealing with light quanta can be applied equally well to the much broader
class of particles obeying Bose-Einstein statistics. These include atoms of He4,
Na23, Rb87, and all of the others which have recently been Bose-condensed by
optical means. When proper account is taken of the atomic interactions and
the non-vanishing atomic masses, the coherent state formalism is found to
furnish useful descriptions of the behavior of these bosonic gases.
   The formalism seems likewise to apply to subatomic particles, to bosons that
are only short-lived. The pions that emerge by hundreds or even thousands
from the high-energy collisions of heavy ions are also bosons. The pions of
similar charge have a clearly noticeable tendency to be emitted with closely
correlated momenta, an effect which is evidently analogous to the Hanbury
Brown-Twiss correlation of photons, and invites the same sort of analysis.21

   Particles obeying Fermi-Dirac statistics, of course, behave quite differently
from photons or pions. No more than a single one of them ever occupies any
given quantum state. This kind of reckoning associated with fermion fields
is radically different therefore from the sort we have associated with bosons,
like photons. It has proved possible, nonetheless, to develop an algebraic
scheme22 for calculating expectation values of products of fermion fields
that is remarkably parallel to the one we have described for photon fields.
There is a one-to-one correspondence between the mathematical operations
and expressions for boson fields on the one hand and fermion fields on the
other. That correspondence has promise of proving useful in describing the
dynamics of degenerate fermion gases.
   I’d like, as a final note, to share with you an experience I had in 1951, while
I was a postdoc at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. Possessed by
the habit of working late at night – in fact on photon statistics13 at the time
– I didn’t often appear at my Institute desk early in the day. Occasionally
I walked out to the Institute around noon, and that was closer to the end
of the work day for Professor Einstein. Our paths thus crossed quite a few
times, and on one of those occasions I had ventured to bring my camera.
He seemed more than willing to let me take his picture as if acknowledging

his role as a local landmark, and he stood for me just as rigidly still. Here,
in Figure 10, is the hitherto unpublished result. I shall always treasure that
image, and harbor the enduring wish I had been able to ask him just a few
questions about that remarkable year, 1905.
