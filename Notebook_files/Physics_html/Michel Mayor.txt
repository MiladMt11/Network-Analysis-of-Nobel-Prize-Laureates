The people of this country have shown love and consideration for the beauty as it appears in all these forms; in particular, one can congratulate the Swedes on having valued and preserved their natural heritage. Now we in the United Nations are listening to Sweden's call to the whole world to investigate how we can all contribute to preserving and restoring the natural state of every blue planet, which looks so inviting from afar.

For me, it is a great personal pleasure to visit Sweden again and to visit its friendly capital for the first time. On behalf of my dear wife Margaret, my brother, and my own: a heartfelt thank you for all the hospitality towards us. Thanks!
