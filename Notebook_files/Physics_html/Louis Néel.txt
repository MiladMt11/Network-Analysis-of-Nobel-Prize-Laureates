         Magnetism and the local molecular field
                       Nobel Lecture, December 11, 1970



                         1. The Weiss molecular field

It has long been known that ferromagnetism originates from interactions be-
tween the atomic magnetic moments which tend to align them parallel to one
another in spite of thermal motion. In order to obtain a quantitative explana-
tion of the experimental facts, Pierre Weiss1 assumed that a ferromagnetic
behaved as a pure paramagnetic, i.e. a paramagnetic with carriers of indepen-
dent moments and magnetization given by

                                                                              (1)
and that the field of the interactions was equivalent to that of an imaginary
magnetic field hm, called the molecular field, which was proportional to the
magnetization:
                                     hm=nJ                                    (2)

and which added to the applied field H. One thus obtains, if H is sufficiently
the weak, so-called Curie-Weiss law of magnetization:

                                        with θ =
                                 T-θ

If θ is positive, the                  becomes infinite when the temperature
falls below the Curie point θ. From this temperature θ to absolute zero the
substance assumes under the effect of its molecular field alone         a certain
spontaneous magnetization,Js.
   In this conception, the molecular field is considered to be a uniform field in-
side the ferromagnetic specimen. Furthermore, to give his theory a more
complete nature, P. Weiss distinguished the energy molecular field, defined
starting from the internal energy U by the relationship:

                                                                              (4)

from the corrective molecular field of the equation of state   defined, as stated

above, by:

                                                                            (5)

A thermodynamic argument shows that the following relationship exists be-
tween these two fields:




This manner of explanation, theoretically very satisfactory, enables the energy
properties of ferromagnetic substances to be treated and explained elegantly
and simply, but it has the disadvantage of leading one to admit as a dogma the
uniformity of the molecular field and all that follows therefrom, in particular
the linear variation of the reciprocal susceptibility with temperature above the
Curie point. This certainly retarded progress in the theory.



                          2. The local molecular field

On the other hand, P. Weiss was unable to give a satisfactory solution to the
problem of the origin of the molecular field. It was only in 1928 that Heisen-
berg found an interaction mechanism giving a satisfactory order of magni-
tude. From the point of view of interest to us, it is essential only to point out
that this involved very short-range interactions, preponderant between first-
neighbour atoms and negligible beyond the second or third neighbours.
   If, then, we consider an alloy composed of two kinds of randomly distrib-
uted atoms A and B, the surroundings of the atoms may be very different and
the approximation of a unique molecular field representing for all sites the
action of the surroundings must be very poor. The theoretical problem of the
rigorous treatment of such interactions is still far from being solved but, while
retaining the simplicity of the theories based on the molecular field, we can
improve them considerably by introducing what I have called local molecu-
lar fields.
   Weiss’ hypothesis amounts to writing that the energy EC of the system of A
and B atoms is expressed in the form:

                                                                             (7)
                  denote the magnetizations of the A and B atoms respectively.
 Actually, since their energy is the sum of the contributions made by pairs of


320                          1970 LOUIS N É E L

close-neighbour atoms, A-A, A-B, and B-B, we should rather write:
                    =                                                       (8)
This amounts to abandoning the notion of a general molecular field and to
introducing local molecular fields, hA = nAA JA + nABJB, and hB = nAB JA +
nBBJB, acting on the A and B atoms respectively.
   I developed this way of looking at the problem for the first time2 in 1932,
and showed that the susceptibility χ of an alloy containing proportions P and
Q of A and B atoms, with Curie constants CA and CB, was expressed by:

                                                                            (9)
                             Q
Instead of being represented by a straight line, the temperature dependence of
the reciprocal susceptibility      was now represented by a hyperbola.
   I applied this theory to the interpretation of the properties of platinum-co-
balt alloys and, a little later , to iron-cobalt, iron-nickel, and cobalt-nickel
                               3

also by a sharp maximum in the specific heat. At temperatures below this
maximum an antiferromagnetic order exists, which may be detected by
neutron diffraction.

magnesium, lead, and calcium ferrites, those of magnetite Fe3O4 and of man-
ganese antimonide Mn2Sb. As examples, Figs. 9-12 show a comparison of the
experimental and the calculated values in the case of Fe 3O4 and of Mn2Sb for
the temperature dependence of the spontaneous magnetization and of the
reciprocal susceptibility. Naturally, the same set of coefficients n, α and β is
used in both cases. The result was encouraging, so a considerable experimental
effort was launched immediately to test the theory, since the existing experi-
mental material was fairly meagre.

In pure inverse ferrites Fe 2O 3MO, with M=Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, the saturation
magnetic moment at absolute zero must simply be that of the M ion, since the
magnetic moments of the two Fe3+ ions exactly cancel each other, located as
they are on different kinds of sites. Fig. 13 enables the theory to be compared
with experiment. The points correspond to the experimental results21. The
straight line corresponds to the theoretical predictions with the « spin only »
values of the magnetic moments, and the shaded region to the theoretical pre-
dictions corrected by taking into account the incompletely quenched orbital
angular moment, deduced from the determination of the effective moment
of the corresponding paramagnetic salts. The agreement is very satisfactory.

was the first time that their objective existence had been clearly demonstrated.
   Thus, in oxides and ferrites exchange interactions of the classical type M-M
coexist with superexchange interactions of the type M-O-M; this, then, is
first-class material for testing the theories of the various interactions.

Despite its rather naive simplicity, the local molecular-field method has had
some undeniable successes in linking up, in an intellectually very satisfying
way, a large number of already known facts and in leading to the discovery of
new facts.

therefore indicated.
  On the other hand, recourse to the local molecular field seems essential, for
