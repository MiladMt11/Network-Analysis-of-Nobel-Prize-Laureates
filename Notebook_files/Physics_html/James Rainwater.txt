BACKGROUND FOR THE SPHEROIDAL
NUCLEAR MODEL PROPOSAL

 The conceptual developments on which my award is based occurred to me
 about twenty-six years ago in late 1949. I shall attempt, as accurately as I
can remember, to reconstruct how I viewed the situation of the nuclear shell
model and non-spherical nuclear shape at that time.
     In a sense the subject began in 1910 when Ernest Rutherford’s α particle
scattering experiments (1) showed that the nuclear size is         10-12 cm radius,
although the atom size is ~ 1 0 cm. This led to Niels Bohr’s (2) 1913 theory
                                  -8



of the hydrogen atom in terms of quantized electron orbits about the nucleus.
This was extended by many workers, especially via the Wilson-Sommerfeld
quantization rule that          =      for each degree of freedom, where q i a n d
p i are the generalized coordinates and momenta of an electron in its orbit
about the nucleus. The proposal in 1925 by Goudsmit and Uhlenbeck (3)
of the concept of spin 1/2 for the electron and the statement by Pauli (4) of the
exclusion principle for electrons, later generalized to all spin 1/2 particles, led
to an understanding of the Periodic Table of the Elements, using the old
quantum theory, in terms of filling electron shells.
     The development of quantum mechanics in 1926 placed the subject on a
proper foundation and led to an explosion of the development of atomic
physics as is evident from a perusal of the 1935 treatise by E. U. Condon and
G. H. Shortley, The Theory of Atomic Spectra, Cambridge University Press
 (1935 and 1951). In the case of the electron orbits or shells about the nucleus,
the potential is dominated by the central coulomb attraction of the nucleus,
thus permitting treatment of angular momentum as a good quantum number
to a good approximation. The coulomb force law was completely known. For
the nucleus, early attempts to treat it as composed of protons and electrons were
unsatisfactory. When the neutron was discovered by Chadwick in 1932, the
picture shifted to a nucleus composed of neutrons and protons bound by strong
short range forces. Measurements of nuclear spins soon established that the
neutron and proton should probably be taken to have spin 1/2 and to obey
Dirac Theory and the Pauli exclusion principle, thus providing a basis for a
nuclear shell model. My own detailed introduction to the subject was mainly
provided by Bethe’s massive review of Nuclear Physics (5) in the 1936, 1937
issues of Reviews of Modern Physics.
    The subject of attempts at a nuclear shell model are reviewed by Bethe and
Bather. (5) I was particularly familiar with the 1937 article by Feenberg and
Phillips, (6) “On the Structure of Light Nuclei”, where the Hartree method
was used with a simplified assumed potential to investigate possible spin
orbit Russell Saunders coupling states in filling the first l = 1 shell between

 He and 16O, to explain the behavior of ground and excited nuclear states,
etc. A model of particles in a spherical box has the first 1 s (l = 0) state filled
by 2 neutrons (N) and 2 protons          at 4He. This nucleus is certainly excep-
tionally stable, having a binding energy of over 20 MeV for the last nucleon.
The first p shell (l = 1) then begins, which is closed at 16O. It is interesting that
the mass A = 5 system is unable to bind the last nucleon and appears as a
resonance for neutron or proton scattering on helium. The third shell holds
the second s and the first d (l = 2) shell and is filled at 40 Ca         = N = 20)
which is also unusually bound. It is the heaviest stable nucleus having          =
Beyond this the predicted shell closings disagreed with experiment. The basic
force law between nucleons was poorly known.
    Before 1940 it was known that the nuclear volume and total nuclear binding
both increased roughly linearly with A, the number of nucleons. The range of
the nuclear force between nucleons was known to be           2x        cm and to be
deep enough to give the single bound ground state for the deuteron when
n and p spins were parallel, but not when they are antiparallel. A major
question involved the reason for “saturation of nuclear forces: i.e., why binding
did not increase as A(A-      the number of possible pairings with a “collapsed”
nucleus having radius               cm. This was “answered” by Heisenberg,
Wigner, Majorana and others in an ad-hoc fashion by assuming “exchange
forces” which were attractive or repulsive depending on the wave function
exchange properties. Only after 1950 did Jastrow introduce the concept of a
short range repulsion which is now accepted as the reason.
    In 1935, Weizsacker introduced his semi-emperical binding energy formula
(7) including volume, surface, isotope, coulomb, and “odd-even” or pairing
terms to explain the general trend of nuclear binding. The surface term noted
that surface nucleons were less bound, giving a decrease in binding proportional
to       for the radius proportional to A        This gives less binding for light
nuclei and partially explains why maximum stability occurs near                  The
isotope term is easily understood on a shell model basis or using a
Thomas statistical model. The number of filled space states increases as
or         for protons and neutrons. For a given A, minimum kinetic energy
occurs for      =    For    >   one must change                protons to neutrons
of higher kinetic energy, with the average kinetic energy change per trans-
ferred nucleon proportional to                for a total kinetic energy increase
proportional to               This favors N =      for stability. This is balanced
by the coulomb repulsion energy of the protons which is proportional to
               This favors having only neutrons. The stability balance for
stable nuclei has an increasingly large fraction of the nucleons as neutrons
as A becomes large. This term also gives reduced binding per nucleon be-
yond 56Fe and leads to instability against a decay beyond A            208 with not
 too long lifetimes for the He fragment to penetrate the coulomb barrier.

It was observed that even        even     (e,e) nuclei were unusually stable rela-
 tive to odd, odd (0,0) nuclei, such that after 14N the stable nuclei for even A
all were (e,e), often having two stable even        values for each even A        36.
For odd A, there is almost always only one naturally occurring stable          value,

with (e,o) and (o,e) equally favored. This extra binding, + δ for ee, zero for

approximately as 1 2 A MeV. (See Bethe and Bacher (5), p. 104.) It is

also observed that the ground states of even A nuclei have net spin zero,
indicating a space pairing (potential energy) for strongest interaction to
cancel the angular momentum contributions. Figure 1, from the Bohr-
Mottelson text (8), plots the observed binding per nucleon for beta stable
nuclei, vs A, with a best fit semi-emperical curve for comparison. The devia-
tions of the experimental bindings from the smooth curve give hints of shell
structure effects.
   In the early 1930’s, the energy dependence of the interaction cross section
for reactions involving neutrons or protons incident on nuclei was treated by
what is now referred to as an optical model approach. The incident nucleon-
nucleus interaction was treated using a smoothed interaction potential for the

nucleon inside the nucleus. This model predicted “shape” resonances with huge
resonance widths and spacings. Early experiments (5) using slow neutrons
revealed cross section (compound nucleus) resonances for medium-heavy
nuclei ~ 10 to 100 eV apart, with < 1 eV resonance widths. This led N. Bohr
to suggest a liquid drop model (9) of the nucleus where the incoming nucleon,
as for a molecule hitting a liquid drop, is absorbed near the surface and loses
its identity. This is not necessarily incompatible with a shell model, since
the shell model refers mainly to the lowest states of a set of fermions in the
nuclear “container”. However, when combined with the discouragingly poor
fits with experiment of detailed shell model predictions (6), the situation
 ~ 1948 was one of great discouragement concerning a shell model approach.
    In the first part of 1949, three groups presented different “explanations”
of nuclear shell structure (10) in the same issue of Physical Review. Of these,
that of Maria Mayer became the now accepted model. A similar proposal by
J. H. D. Jensen and colleagues at the same time led to the Nobel Award in
Physics to Mayer and Jensen in 1963. From 1948 to ~ 1962, I taught a course
in “Advanced Nuclear Physics” for graduate students at Columbia. I was
also, as an experimental physicist, working on the completion of the Columbia
University Nevis Synchrocyclotron which first became operational in March,
 1950. During the 1949-50 academic year, I shared an office, Room 910
 Pupin, with Aage Bohr who was visiting Columbia that year. I was partic-
 ularly excited about the Mayer shell model which suddenly made under-
standable a vast amount of experimental data on spins, magnetic moments,
isomeric states, β decay systematics, and the “magic numbers” at            = 2,8,
20 (28), 50, 82, 126. I reviewed this material at a seminar at Columbia that
year.
    For over a year previously, I had felt that shell model aspects should have a
large degree of validity for nuclei for the following reason. When one considers
forming the nuclear wave functions, in 3A dimensional coordinate space, for A
nucleons in a spherical box the size of the nucleus, the shell model states result
in lowest kinetic energy. The effective potential energy and the shell model
kinetic energy (for r < R) are both quite large compared with the net binding
energy (~ 8 MeV) for the least bound nucleons. This is illustrated in Fig. 2
 (from Ref. 8). The single particle state energies vs A have as the “valence”
 nucleon that with E n about --8 MeV. If one attempts to use ψ functions wherein
 the spatial behavior for each nucleon is very different from that predicted by
 the shell model, the effect is equivalent to mixing in large amounts of higher
 energy states having compatible symmetry properties. This mixture of high
 curvature ψ states would greatly increase the < T > for the least bound nu-
 cleons. I pictured the net ψ function not as a pure Hartree product of single
particle ψ functions, but as being nearly so for the long wave length Fourier
 aspects of the functions. The short range nucleon-nucleon attractive force
 would lead to local distortions and clusterings in 3 A dimensional space such
 as of deuterons and of α particle structures, etc., but low energy studies would
emphasize the long wavelength Fourier aspects which are suggested by the
 shell model. I was thus delighted by the success of the Mayer model. (I was


not then aware of Jensen’s work.) The N. Bohr liquid drop model for nuclear
reactions and fission did not seem to me to contradict the shell model since
the concept of scattering is meaningless for a many fermion ground state, but
not for an incident continuum state particle which is not inhibited by the
Pauli principle from knocking bound nucleons to excited (unoccupied) states.
The compound nucleus states emphasized by Bohr involved an eventual sharing
of the excitation by many nucleons so ~ 10 eV level spacing for medium A
nuclei plus slow l = 0 neutrons could result. Since ~ 1941, I had been using
the small Columbia cyclotron to carry out slow neutron time of flight spectro-
scopy studies in collaboration with W. W. Havens, Jr., and C. S. Wu, under
Professor J. R. Dunning. We were quite aware of the famous 1939 paper of N.
Bohr and J. A. Wheeler on the theory of nuclear fission (11) which emphasized
that excited nuclei need not be spherical.

     In later 1949, Professor C. H. Townes gave a colloquium presenting the
results of a review by Townes, Foley, and Low (12) of the currently available
experimental data on nuclear electrical quadrupole moments. The figure
which they presented, is shown in Fig. 3. The measured quadrupole moments
are presented in the form Q/( 1.5 x 1 0-l3 A 1/3 c m )2. The trend shows a qualita-
tive agreement with the Mayer-Jensen shell model, going to zero as one
passes through closed neutron and proton shell numbers. For closed shell plus
one extra high l proton, the value of Q is negative as expected for a proton in
an equatorial orbit. As nucleons are removed from a high l closed shell, the
value of Q becomes increasingly positive, reaching a maximum near where
the l orbital is half filled, and subsequently decreasing. The problem expressed
was that the value of Q / R , using R = 1.5 x 1 0 - A / cm, reaches 10 for
                                 2                        13 1 3

model wave functions coupled to give a 7 - state              = 71,   = 105, τ = 4 x
10 10y). The rare earth nuclei particularly show much larger than expected Q
values.
     As Professor Townes was talking, what seemed like the obvious simple
explanation suggested itself to me. Although the Mayer shell model used
single particle wave functions based on a spherical potential, the Bohr-Wheeler
fission paper showed that, if energetically favorable, the nucleus would distort
to a spheroidal shape. For small values of the fractional difference β between
the major and minor axes, for constant nuclear volume, the surface area term

          For a closed shell, <             = <        = <       averaged over
all    (= m) for high l, so there is zero net linear term in the change in total
kinetic energy with the distortion parameter β. For a high l closed shell
minus equatorial (high         orbitals, the net nuclear angular momentum is the
negative of the contribution of the missing nucleons (holes) and the contribution
to the kinetic energy term linear in β is equal and opposite to that of the missing
equatorial orbit nucleons. The important point is that this yields a term linear
in β favoring        0, while the restoring terms are quadratic in β. The expected
equlibrium β is thus ≠ 0 and is proportional to the coefficient of the linear
term for not too large deviations of β from unity. This gives a prolate (cigar)
shaped distortion.
    The next step was to attempt a more quantitative evaluation of the β 2
restoring term. For this, I found the 1939 paper (13, 7) by E. Feenberg useful.

He noted that the surface energy increased as                     1+      ..   and


the coulomb energy decreased as           =     [1           ..    which requires

F = 2Eso/Eco          42.6         > 1 for a net positive restoring      term. This
predicted zero net         restoring term for        125 for beta stable nuclei (no
resistance to fission). The net term was                       -0.054        MeV.
Using this value gave 14            = - 11 for a single high l nucleon above closed
shell for a fictitious case of A ~ 176. The picture, if anything, seemed capable
of giving even larger Q/R* values than were observed experimentally.
   For a prolate spheroidal potential, with the distortion axis in the Z direc-
tion, the ψ dependence of the single particle ψ for lZ = m is still   However
1, and   and    cannot be good quantum numbers. The core must somehow
share the net angular momentum. This consideration helps when one considers
the deviations of the observed magnetic moments from the Schmidt limits
predicted by the simple shell model.
  Aage Bohr pointed out to me at the time (14) that if the nucleus is a spheroid
with an “intrinsic” quadrupole moment Q0 relative to its distortion axis, and
total angular momentum is I, the maximum “observed” Q is reduced by a
factor                       = 1/10, 2/7, 5/12, and 28/55 for I = 1, 2, 3, 4.
This emphasizes that Q = 0 for I = 0 or l/2, but Q 0 may not be zero. Bohr,

Mottelson and colleagues (15) subsequently treated the situation for coulomb
excitation cross sections for low lying rotational states. The excitation cross
sections uniquely establish the intrinsic quadrupole moment Q o for the ground
states of distorted even-even nuclei as well as for odd A nuclei. Figure 4 was
prepared by Professor Townes ~ 1957 for a review article on measured quadru-

pole moments (16). The largest intrinsic quadrupole moments occur for the
rare earth region before the double closed shell                = 82,    = 126, and
beyond A ~     230 where  even higher  j single particle states are involved. Figure
5 shows a recent plot from the just released Vol. II of Bohr- Mottelson, Nuclear
Structure (8).The distortion parameter 8 is nearly the same as the parameter β
discussed above. It is seen, as was evident from Professor Townes’ 1949 collo-
quium (12), that many nuclei deviate quite strongly from spherical shape so
it does not make sense to use a spherical nuclear model in these regions of
atomic size.
   After Professor Townes’ colloquium, Dr. Bohr and I had many discussions
of my concept. He was particularly interested in the dynamical aspects. The
distortion bulge could in principle vibrate or move around to give the effect
of rotational levels. The first result was his January 1951 paper (17), “On the
Quantization of Angular Momenta in Heavy Nuclei”. The subsequent ex-
ploitation of the subject by Bohr, Mottelson and their colleagues is now history
and the main reason for our presence here at this time.
   I should mention that the program of evaluating the energies of single
particle states in distorted nuclei was subsequently carried out in proper form
by Mottelson and Nilsson and by Nilsson alone in the form of “Nilsson dia-
grams ” such as in Fig. 6, which is for proton single particle states beyond

   = 82 vs the distortion. They have also made detailed comparisons, with
experimental values of the predicted distortions, etc. with generally excellent
results (8). It has also been established that some nuclei have appreciable
octopole electric moments and distortions, a generalization of the concept.
   One interesting feature of the distorted nucleus shell model is that as the
distortion increases, the net energy may go through a minimum and then
increase until the energy of an initially higher energy orbital, which decreases
faster with deformation, crosses below the previous last filled orbital and
subsequently becomes the defining least bound filled state. The net energy
may then decrease and show a second minima, etc. vs distortion. This is shown
in Fig. 7 which is Fig. 25 of Dr. S. A. Moszkowski’s review article (18). This
effect seems to be present in sub-threshold nuclear fission where the barrier
shape has two minima as shown in Fig. 8 (from Ref. 8, Vol. II, p. 633). This
was suggested by Dr. V. M. Strutinski (19) in 1967.
