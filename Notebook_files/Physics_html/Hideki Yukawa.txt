              Meson theory in its developments
                       Nobel Lecture, December 12, 1949



The meson theory started from the extension of the concept of the field of
force so as to include the nuclear forces in addition to the gravitational and
electromagnetic forces. The necessity of introduction of specific nuclear
forces, which could not be reduced to electromagnetic interactions between
charged particles, was realized soon after the discovery of the neutron, which
 was to be bound strongly to the protons and other neutrons in the atomic
nucleus. As pointed out by WignerI, specific nuclear forces between two
 nucleons, each of which can be either in the neutron state or the proton state,
 must have a very short range of the order of 10 cm, in order to account
                                                   -13



 for the rapid increase of the binding energy from the deuteron to the alpha-
 particle. The binding energies of nuclei heavier than the alpha-particle do
 not increase as rapidly as if they were proportional to the square of the mass
 number A, i.e. the number of nucleons in each nucleus, but they are in fact
approximately proportional to A. This indicates that nuclear forces are sat-
 urated for some reason. Heisenberg2 suggested that this could be accounted
 for, if we assumed a force between a neutron and a proton, for instance, due
 to the exchange of the electron or, more generally, due to the exchange
 of the electric charge, as in the case of the chemical bond between a hydro-
                                                    3
 gen atom and a proton. Soon afterwards, Fermi developed a theory of be-
 ta-decay based on the hypothesis by Pauli, according to which a neutron,
 for instance, could decay into a proton, an electron, and a neutrino, which
 was supposed to be a very penetrating neutral particle with a very small mass.
    This gave rise, in turn, to the expectation that nuclear forces could be re-
 duced to the exchange of a pair of an electron and a neutrino between two
 nucleons, just as electromagnetic forces were regarded as due to the ex-
 change of photons between charged particles. It turned out, however, that
 the nuclear forces thus obtained was much too small4, because the beta-
 decay was a very slow process compared with the supposed rapid exchange
 of the electric charge responsible for the actual nuclear forces. The idea of
 the meson field was introduced in 1935 in order to make up this gaps.
  Original assumptions of the meson theory were as follows:

I. The nuclear forces are described by a scalar field U, which satisfies the
wave equation




in vacuum, where x is a constant with the dimension of reciprocal length.
Thus, the static potential between two nucleons at a distance r is proportional
to exp (-xr ) / r, th e range of forces being given by I/x.
II. According to the general principle of quantum theory, the field U is
inevitably accompanied by new particles or quanta, which have the mass




and the spin o, obeying Bose-Einstein statistics. The mass of these particles
can be inferred from the range of nuclear forces. If we assume, for instance,
x = 5 x 10    12
                  cm- , we obtain µ ≅ 200 m e, where m e is the mass of the
                    I



electron.
III . In order to obtain exchange forces, we must assume that these mesons
have the electric charge + e or - e, and that a positive (negative) meson is
emitted (absorbed) when the nucleon jumps from the proton state to the
neutron state, whereas a negative (positive) meson is emitted (absorbed)
when the nucleon jumps from the neutron to the proton. Thus a neutron
and a proton can interact with each other by exchanging mesons just as two
charged particles interact by exchanging photons. In fact, we obtain an ex-
change force of Heisenberg type between the neutron and the proton of the
 correct magnitude, if we assume that the coupling constant g between the
nucleon and the meson field, which has the same dimension as the elemen-
tary charge e, is a few times larger than e.
     However, the above simple theory was incomplete in various respects. For
one thing, the exchange force thus obtained was repulsive for triplet S-state
of the deuteron in contradiction to the experiment, and moreover we could
not deduce the exchange force of Majorana type, which was necessary in
 order to account for the saturation of nuclear forces just at the alpha-particle.
 In order to remove these defects, more general types of meson fields in-
cluding vector, pseudoscalar and pseudovector fields in addition to the scalar
 fields, were considered by various authors 6 . In particular, the vector field


130                             1949   H.YUKAWA

was investigated in detail, because it could give a combination of exchange
forces of Heisenberg and Majorana types with correct signs and could further
account for the anomalous magnetic moments of the neutron and the proton
qualitatively. Furthermore, the vector theory predicted the existence of non-
central forces between a neutron and a proton, so that the deuteron might
have the electric quadripole moment. However, the actual electric quadri-
pole moment turned out to be positive in sign, whereas the vector theory
anticipated the sign to be negative. The only meson field, which gives the
correct signs both for nuclear forces and for the electric quadripole moment
of the deuteron, was the pseudoscalar field7. There was, however, another
feature of nuclear forces, which was to be accounted for as a consequence of
the meson theory. Namely, the results of experiments on the scattering of
protons by protons indicated that the type and magnitude of interaction be-
tween two protons were, at least approximately, the same as those between
a neutron and a proton, apart from the Coulomb force. Now the interaction
between two protons or two neutrons was obtained only if we took into
account the terms proportional to g4, whereas that between a neutron and a
proton was proportional to g2, as long as we were considering charged
mesons alone. Thus it seemed necessary to assume further:
IV. In addition to charged mesons, there are neutral mesons with the mass
 either exactly or approximately equal to that of charged mesons. They must
also have the integer spin, obey Bose-Einstein statistics and interact with
nucleons as strongly as charged mesons.
    This assumption obviously increased the number of arbitrary constants in
meson theory, which could be so adjusted as to agree with a variety of exper-
imental facts. These experimental facts could-not be restricted to those of
 nuclear physics in the narrow sense, but was to include those related to cos-
 mic rays, because we expected that mesons could be created and annihilated
 due to the interaction of cosmic ray particles with energies much larger than

cosmic rays in 1937 was a great encouragement to further developments of
                    8



meson theory. At that time, we came naturally to the conclusion that the
mesons which constituted the main part of the hard component of cosmic
rays at sea level was to be identified with the mesons which were responsible
for nuclear force9. Indeed, cosmic ray mesons had the mass around 200 m      e


as predicted and moreover, there was the definite evidence for the sponta-
neous decay, which was the consequence of the following assumption of the
original meson theory :

V. Mesons interact also with light particles, i.e. electrons and neutrinos, just
as they interact with nucleons, the only difference being the smallness of the
coupling constant g’ in this case compared with g. Thus a positive (negative)
meson can change spontaneously into a positive (negative) electron and a
neutrino, as pointed out first by Bhabha . The proper lifetime, i.e. the mean
                                         10



lifetime at rest, of the charged scalar meson, for example, is given by




   For the meson moving with velocity ν, the lifetime increases by a factor
I      --        due to the well-known relativistic delay of the moving clock.
Although the spontaneous decay and the velocity dependence of the lifetime
of cosmic ray mesons were remarkably confirmed by various experimentsII,
there was an undeniable discrepancy between theoretical and experimental
values for the lifetime. The original intention of meson theory was to ac-
count for the beta-decay by combining the assumptions III and V together.
However, the coupling constant g’, which was so adjusted as to give the
correct result for the beta-decay, turned out to be too large in that it gave
the lifetime τ0 of mesons of the order of 10 sec, which was much smaller
                                                -8



than the observed lifetime 2 x 10 sec. Moreover, there were indications,
                                    -6



which were by no means in favour of the expectation that cosmic-ray me-
sons interacted strongly with nucleons. For example, the observed cross-
section of scattering of cosmic-ray mesons by nuclei was much smaller than
that obtained theoretically. Thus, already in 1941, the identification of the
cosmic-ray meson with the meson, which was supposed to be responsible
for nuclear forces, became doubtful. In fact, Tanikawa and Sakata12 proposed
in 1942 a new hypothesis as follows: The mesons which constitute the hard
component of cosmic rays at sea level are not directly connected with nuclear
forces, but are produced by the decay of heavier mesons which interacted
strongly with nucleons.
   However, we had to wait for a few years before this two-meson hypoth-
esis was confirmed, until 1947, when two very important facts were discov-
ered. First, it was discovered by Italian physicists’s that the negative mesons
in cosmic rays, which were captured by lighter atoms, did not disappear in-
stantly, but very often decayed into electrons in a mean time interval of the
order of 10-6 sec. This could be understood only if we supposed that ordinary
mesons in cosmic rays interacted very weakly with nucleons. Soon after-


132                            1949       H.YUKAWA

wards, Powell and others14 discovered two types of mesons in cosmic rays,
the heavier mesons decaying in a very short time into lighter mesons. Just
before the latter discovery, the two-meson hypothesis was proposed by
Marshak and Bethe15 independent of the Japanese physicists above men-
tioned. In 1948 , mesons were created artificially in Berkeley16 and subsequent
experiments confirmed the general picture of two-meson theory. The fun-
damental assumptions are now17
(i) The heavier mesons, i.e. n-mesons with the mass            about 280 me interact
strongly with nucleons and can decay into lighter mesons, i.e. π-mesons and
neutrinos with a lifetime of the order of 10-8 sec; π-mesons have integer spin
 (very probably spin o) and obey B ose-Einstein statistics. They are respon-
 sible for, at least, a part ofnuclear forces. In fact, the shape ofnuclear potential
 at a distance of the order of          or larger could be accounted for as due to
 the exchange of π-mesons between nucleons.
 (ii) The lighter mesons, i.e. µ -mesons with the mass about 210 m are the e


 main constituent of the hard component of cosmic rays at sea level and can
 decay into electrons and neutrinos with the lifetime 2 x 10     -6
                                                                    sec . They have
 very probably spin ½ and obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. As they interact only
 weakly with nucleons, they have nothing to do with nuclear forces.
    Now, if we accept the view that π-mesons are the mesons that have been
anticipated from the beginning, then we may expect the existence of neutral
 π-mesons in addition to charged π-mesons. Such neutral mesons, which have
 integer spin and interact as strongly as charged mesons with nucleons, must
 be very unstable, because each of them can decay into two or three photons 18.
 In particular, a neutral meson with spin o can decay into two photons and
 the lifetime is of the order of 10 sec or even less than that. Very recently,
                                    -14



 it became clear that some of the experimental results obtained in Berkeley
 could be accounted for consistently by considering that, in addition to
 charged n-mesons, neutral n-mesons with the mass approximately equal to
 that of charged π-mesons were created by collisions of high-energy protons
 with atomic nuclei and that each of these neutral mesons decayed into two
 mesons with the lifetime of the order of 10 sec or less19.Thus, the neutral
                                                 -13



 mesons must have spin o.
    In this way, meson theory has changed a great deal during these fifteen
 years. Nevertheless, there remain still many questions unanswered. Among
 other things, we know very little about mesons heavier than π-mesons. We
 do not know yet whether some of the heavier mesons are responsible for
 nuclear forces at very short distances. The present form of meson theory is

not free from the divergence difficulties, although recent development of
relativistic field theory has succeeded in removing some of them. We do not
yet know whether the remaining divergence difficulties are due to our ig-
norance of the structure of elementary particles themselves 20.We shall prob-
ably have to go through another change of the theory, before we shall be
able to arrive at the complete understanding of the nuclear structure and of
various phenomena, which will occur in high energy regions.
