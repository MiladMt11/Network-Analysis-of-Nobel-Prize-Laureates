1.0 INTRODUCTION
The development of rockets and satellites capable of carrying instruments
outside the absorbing layers of the Earth’s atmosphere has made possible the
observation of celestial objects in the x-ray range of wavelength.
   X-rays of energy greater than several hundreds of electron volts can pene-
trate the interstellar gas over distances comparable to the size of our own
galaxy, with greater or lesser absorption depending on the direction of the
line of sight. At energies of a few kilovolts, x-rays can penetrate the entire col-
umn of galactic gas and in fact can reach us from distances comparable to the
radius of the universe.
   The possibility of studying celestial objects in x-rays has had a profound sig-
nificance for all astronomy. Over the x-ray to gamma-ray range of energies, x-
rays are, by number of photons, the most abundant flux of radiation that can
reveal to us the existence of high energy events in the cosmos. By high ener-
gy events I mean events in which the total energy expended is extremely high
(supernova explosions, emissions by active galactic nuclei, etc.) or in which
the energy acquired per nucleon or the temperature of the matter involved is
extremely high (infall onto collapsed objects, high temperature plasmas, in-
teraction of relativistic electrons with magnetic or photon fields).
   From its beginning in 1962 until today, the instrumentation for x-ray astro-
nomical observations has improved in sensitivity by more than 9 orders of
magnitude, comparable to the entire improvement from the capability of the
naked eye to those of the current generation of 8- or 10-meter telescopes. All
categories of celestial objects, from planets to normal stars, from ordinary
galaxies to quasars, from small groups of galaxies to the furthest known clus-
ters, have been observed. As a result of these studies it has become apparent
that high energy phenomena play a fundamental role in the formation and
in the chemical and dynamical evolution of structures on all scales. X-ray ob-
servations have proved of crucial importance in discovering important as-
pects of these phenomena. It was from x-ray observations that we obtained
the first evidence for gravitational energy release due to infall of matter onto
a collapsed object such as a neutron star or black hole. It was the x-ray emis-
sion from the high temperature plasmas in clusters of galaxies that revealed

this high temperature component of the Universe, which more than doubled
the amount of “visible” matter (baryons) present in clusters.
   The prospects for future studies of the universe in x-rays are equally bright.
The advent of new and even more powerful experimental techniques, such as
non-dispersive high resolution spectroscopy and x-ray telescopes capable of
focusing increasingly higher energies over wider fields, ensures a wide op-
portunity for new astronomical discoveries.


2.0 THE BEGINNING OF X-RAY ASTRONOMY
There had been solar x-ray observations for about 10 years by the Naval
Research Laboratory (NRL) group led by Herbert Friedman and several
failed attempts to find x-ray emissions from stellar objects (Hirsh, 1979)1
when a group at AS&E (a small private research corporation in Cambridge,
Massachusetts) started work in 1959 to investigate the theoretical and experi-
mental possibilities for carrying out x-ray astronomy. Giacconi, Clark, and
Rossi (Giacconi et al., 1960)2 published a document: “A Brief Review of
Experimental and Theoretical Progress in X-Ray Astronomy,” in which we at-
tempted to estimate expected x-ray fluxes from several celestial sources.
   The results are summarized in Table 1. The Sun produced 106 x-ray pho-
tons cm-2s-1 at Earth which could easily be detected with the then-available

counters with sensitivities of about 10–102 photons cm-2s-1. But if all the stars
emitted x-rays at the same rate as the Sun, we would expect fluxes at earth as
small as 10-4 photons cm-2s-1. Other possible sources, such as supernova rem-
nants, flare stars, peculiar A stars, etc., were considered, and great uncertain-
ty had to be assigned to the estimates of their x-ray fluxes. It seemed that the
brightest source in the night sky could be the Moon, due to fluorescent emis-
sion of lunar material under illumination of solar x-rays.
   We designed an experiment capable of detecting 0.1–1 photon/cm-2s-1, 50
to 100 times more sensitive than any flown before. This increase in sensitivity
was due to larger area, an anticoincidence shield to reduce particle back-

ground, and a wide solid angle to increase the probability of observing a
source during the flight. The payload shown in Fig. 1 was successful in de-
tecting the first stellar x-ray source in the flight of June 12, 1962 (Giacconi et
al., 1962).3 An individual source (Sco X-1) dominated the night sky and was
detected at 28 ± 1.2 counts cm-2s-1, just below the threshold of previous ex-
periments (Fig. 2). No exceptionally bright or conspicuous visible light or ra-
dio object was present at that position (which, however, was very poorly
known). An early confirmation of our result came from the rocket flight of
April 1963 by the NRL group led by Friedman, which also discovered x–ray
emission from the Crab Nebula (Bowyer et al., 1964).4
   The truly extraordinary aspect of the discovery was not that an x-ray star
had been found but its extraordinary properties. The x-ray radiation intensi-
ty from the Sun is only 10-6 of its visible light intensity. In Sco X-1, the x-ray lu-
minosity is 103 times the visible light intensity and it was later determined that
the intrinsic luminosity is 103 the entire luminosity of the Sun! This was a tru-
ly amazing and new type of celestial object. Furthermore, the physical process
by which the x-rays were emitted on Sco X-1 had to be different from any
process for x-ray generation we knew in the laboratory since it has not been
possible on Earth to generate x-rays with 99.9% efficiency.
   Many rocket flights carried out by several groups in the 60’s were able to
find new stellar sources and the first extragalactical sources. The NRL group
and the Lockheed group (led by Phil Fisher) continued to carry out mostly
broad surveys, with the notable exception of the Crab occulation experiment
by NRL in 1964 (Bowyer et al., 1964).5
   The AS&E group concentrated on the detailed study of individual x-ray
sources. Most significant was the series of rocket flights which culminated in
the identification of the optical counterpart of Sco X–1. First the group de-

termined that Sco X–1 could not have the thermal spectrum that would be
expected from neutron stars (Giacconi et al., 1965),6 which implied that an
optical counterpart should have magnitude 13. In a first rocket flight to mea-
sure the angular size of the source it was found to be less than 7 arc sec (Oda
et al., 1965).7 Thus the source had to be a visible star and not a diffused neb-
ulosity. This led to the sophisticated measurement of the location of Sco X–1
by an AS&E-MIT group led by Herbert Gursky (Gursky et al., 1966),8 with suf-
ficient precision to enable its identification with a 13th magnitude star
(Sandage et al., 1966)9 which had spectral characteristics similar to an old no-
va. This renewed interest in a binary star model for Sco X–1 (Burbidge,
1967)10 and Shklovsky proposed a binary containing a neutron star
(Shklovsky, 1967).11 However, the absence of x–ray emission from other no-
vas, the lack of indications from either the optical spectra or the x-ray data of
a binary system, and the general belief that the supernova explosion required
to form the neutron star would disrupt the binary system did not lead to the
general acceptance of the idea. The discovery by Hewish of pulsars in 1967
turned the attention of the theorists to pulsar models for the x–ray emitters.
But such models also were not quite persuasive given the lack of observed
x–ray pulsations. The solution to the riddle of Sco X–1 and similar sources
was not achieved until the launch of the “UHURU” satellite, the first of a gen-
eration of x–ray observatories.
   The proposal to launch a “scanning satellite,” which eventually became
UHURU, was contained in a document written by Herb Gursky and myself
and submitted to NASA on September 25, 1963. In this document we de-
scribed a complete program of x-ray research culminating in the launch of a
1.2 meter diameter x-ray telescope in 1968. This youthful dream was not fully
realized until the launch of the Chandra X-Ray Observatory in 1999, which,
not by chance, had a 1.2 meter diameter mirror. But while the difficult tech-
nology development that made x-ray telescopes possible was being carried
out, the most fundamental advances in x-ray astronomy were made with rela-
tively crude detectors mounted on orbiting satellites.


3.0 DISCOVERIES WITH UHURU
The total amount of time which was available for observation of the x-ray sky
during the 60’s was about one hour: five minutes above 100 km for each of
about a dozen launches. The next step which led us from the phenomeno-
logical discoveries to those of great astrophysical relevance occurred on
December 12, 1970, when UHURU, the first of the Small Astronomy Satellite
series, was launched from the Italian S. Marco platform in Kenya. UHURU
was a small satellite (Fig. 3) which we had labored over at AS&E for seven
years between conception, development, testing, and integration.
   It was the first observatory entirely dedicated to x-ray astronomy and it ex-
tended the time of observation from minutes to years or by 5 orders of mag-
nitude (Giacconi et al., 1971).12 The field of view of the detector on board the
satellite slowly rotated, examining a 5o band of the sky that shifted 1o a day. In

three months all the sky could be studied systematically and many new
sources could be localized with a precision of about 1 arc minute, often per-
mitting the identification of the x-ray sources with a visual or radio counter-
part. This in turn led to an evaluation of the distance, the intrinsic luminosi-
ty, and the physical characteristics of the celestial object from which the x-rays

originated. Among the 300 new sources which were discovered, we were able
to identify binary x-ray sources, supernovas, galaxies, active galaxies, quasars,
and clusters of galaxies (Fig. 4). But even more important from a certain
point of view was the ability, which was provided by the control system, to slow
down the satellite spin and spend a very long time on an individual source to
study its temporal variations. It was this special ability which permitted the so-
lution of the fundamental unresolved problem of x-ray astronomy until then,
namely, the nature of the energy source capable of producing the large in-
trinsic luminosity of the stellar x-ray sources.

3.1 The Binary X-Ray Sources
In summary, inspection of the data revealed that some x-ray sources (Her X-
1 and Cen X-3) (Fig. 5) were regularly pulsating with periods of seconds
(Schreier et al., 1972),13 while others (Cyg X-1) were pulsating with an erratic
behavior with characteristic times of less than a tenth of a second as first not-
ed by Minoru Oda, who was a guest at AS&E at the time. Ethan Schreier and
I noticed that the average intensity of Cen X-3 was modulated over the span
of days and that the period of pulsation itself was changing as a function of
the phase of the average intensity, which exhibited occulations (Fig. 6). The
explanation for this behavior soon became clear: we were observing a stellar
x-ray source orbiting a normal star (Fig. 7). The variation of the pulsation pe-
riod was then due to the Doppler effect. In 1967 Hewish had discovered pul-
sars in the radio domain. Was this x-ray source a pulsar in orbit about a nor-
mal star? This seemed difficult to accept at the time. A pulsar is a neutron star
whose formation is believed to be due to the collapse of a star at the end of its
life. The concomitant explosion was believed to disrupt any binary system in
which it took place. Joseph Taylor had not yet discovered the binary pulsar.

   But a new, unexpected, and important finding came to light: the period of
pulsation was decreasing rather than increasing with time (Fig. 8). This was
true not only in Cen X-3, but also, as Harvey Tananbaum found, in Her X-1
(Tananbaum, 1972).14 Now this was truly embarrassing! In a pulsar the loss of
electromagnetic energy occurs at the expense of the kinetic energy of rota-

tion. But in the x-ray sources the neutron star was acquiring rather than los-
ing energy! The explanation was found in the interaction of the gas in the
normal star with the collapsed star. Gas from the outer layer of the atmos-
phere of the normal star can fall into the strong gravitational field of the col-
lapsed star and acquire energies of order of 0.1 mc2 per nucleon. The accel-

erated nucleons in turn heat a shock of very high temperature above the sur-
face of the neutron star, which emits the observed x-rays (Fig. 9). It is this ma-
terial infall that gives energy to the collapsed object. This is the model for
Sco X–1 and most of the galactic x–ray sources. In the case of a neutron star
with a strong magnetic field (1012 Gauss), the ionized plasma is confined to
the poles of the rotating neutron star, generating the observed periodicities
(Fig. 10). For a black hole, there exists no surface with particular structures
and therefore the pulsation occurs chaotically (Fig. 11).
   The observation by UHURU of rapid variability in Cyg X–1 reported by
Oda (Oda et al., 1971)15 was soon followed by the rocket flights of the GSFC
and MIT groups. These observations clarified that the observed pulsations
were not periodic but chaotic (Holt et al., 1971)16 (Rappaport et al., 1971).17
By 1974, the GSFC group had achieved a temporal resolution of 1 millisec-
ond and showed large chaotic fluctuations occurring even on this time scale
(Rothschild et al., 1974).18 Such behavior could be expected to occur if the
compact object in the binary system (the x–ray source) was a black hole
rather than a neutron star. Stimulated by these findings, the search for optical
or radio counterparts had become intense in 1971–1972. UHURU had ob-
tained a considerably improved position for Cyg X–1 which was made avail-
able to Hjellming and Wade to aid in the search for a radio counterpart
(Tananbaum et al., 1971).19 More refined positions were obtained by the
Japanese group led by Oda (Miyamoto et al., 1971)20 and by the MIT group
(Rappaport et al., 1971)21 by use of modulation collimators. Hjellming and
Wade (Hjellming and Wade, 1971)22 and Braes and Miley (Braes and Miley,
1971)23 reported the discovery of a radio counterpart. The precise radio lo-

cation led to the optical identification by Webster and Murdin (Webster and
Murdin, 1972)24 and by Bolton (Bolton, 1972)25 of Cyg X–1 with the 5.6 day
binary system HDE 226862. The identification of the radio source with
Cyg X–1 was confirmed by the observation of a correlated x–ray radio transi-
tion in Cyg X–1 (Tananbaum et al., 1972).26 Spectroscopic measurements of
the velocity of HDE 226862 also permitted Webster and Murdin to establish
that Cyg X–1 was indeed in a binary system. The estimated mass for the com-
pact object was greater than 6 solar masses. Rhoades and Ruffini had shown
in 1972 that black holes would have masses greater than 3.4 times the mass of
the Sun (Rhoades and Ruffini, 1974).27
   Thus we could reach conclusions regarding Cyg X–1: the Cyg X–1 x–ray
emitter is a compact object of less than 30 km radius due to the rapidity of the
pulsations and the fact that the pulsations are so large that they must involve
the whole object (Giacconi, 1974).28 The object has mass greater than that al-
lowed by our current theories for neutron stars. Therefore the object is the
first candidate for a black hole (Fig. 12). Currently there are at least six can-
didates for galactic x–ray sources containing a black hole (Tanaka, 1992).29
   The consequences of the discovery of binary source x-rays have had far
reaching consequences (Table 2). We had proven the existence of binary sys-
tems containing a neutron star and of systems containing a black hole. Black
holes of solar mass size existed. The binary x-ray sources have become a sort
of physical laboratory where we can study the mass, moment of inertia, and
equation of state for neutron stars (density 1015gr/cm3). We had found a new
source of energy for celestial objects: the infall of accreting material in a
strong gravitation field. For a neutron star the energy liberated per nucleon is
of order of 50 times greater than generated in fusion. The above model (of
accretion of gas on a collapsed object) has become the standard explanation
for the internal engines of quasars and all active nuclei. Recent data seem to
confirm the model of accretion on a massive central black hole of >107 solar
masses as the common denominator among all the active galaxies.

3.2 The Discovery of High Temperature Intergalactic Gas
The establishment of variability in the x–ray universe, the discovery of the ex-
istence of neutron stars and black holes in binary systems, and the discovery
of accretion as a dominant energy source were only the first major accom-
plishments of UHURU. Among others was a second very important discovery
of UHURU and x-ray astronomy, both because of its intrinsic interest and for
its consequences in the field of cosmology, the detection of emission from
clusters of galaxies. This emission is not simply due to the sum of the emission
from individual galaxies, but originates in a thin gas which pervades the space
between galaxies. This gas was heated in the past during the gravitational con-
traction of the cluster to a temperature of millions of degrees and contains as
much mass as that in the galaxies themselves (Gursky et al., 1972)30. In one
stroke the mass of baryons contained in the clusters was more than doubled.
This first finding with UHURU, which could detect only the three richest and
closest galaxy clusters and with a poor angular resolution of 1/2 a degree, were
followed and enormously expanded by the introduction of a new and power-
ful x-ray observatory, “Einstein,” which first utilized a completely new tech-
nology in extrasolar x-ray astronomy: grazing incidence telescopes.


4.0 X–RAY TELESCOPES
Here I must make a short technical diversion to explain the revolution
brought about in x-ray astronomy by the telescope technology. When con-
templating the estimates made in 1959, I was persuaded that to ultimately suc-
ceed in x-ray astronomy, we had to develop new systems quite different from
those then in use. Friedman had developed for solar studies a Geiger counter
with a thin window which allowed the x-ray to penetrate the interior of the
gas volume of the counter. The counter could not decide either the direction
of the incoming x-ray or its energy. In order to improve the directional sensi-
tivity, x–ray astronomers used collimators, that is, mechanical baffles which
defined a field of view typically of 1o. To improve sensitivity we developed anti-
coincidence shields against spurious particles and enlarged the area. This is
what was done in the discovery rocket of 1962. In 1970 UHURU had a very
similar detection system. Its improvement in sensitivity was due to the much
larger area (800 cm2 instead of 10) and the much longer time of observation.
This led to an increase in sensitivity of about 104. It should be noted, however,
that in the presence of a background noise, the sensitivity improvement was
only proportional to the square root of the area. Thus, further improvement
would have required satellites of football-stadium size. Furthermore, all at-
tempts to gain angular resolution by clever systems of baffles (such as the
modulation collimators) led to intrinsically insensitive experiments.
   The solution which occurred to me as early as 1959 was to use a telescope
just as it is done in visible light astronomy (Giacconi and Rossi, 1960).31 This
has the great advantage that the flux from a large area of collection is focused
onto a small detector, therefore improving both the flux and the signal to
noise ratio. In addition, high angular resolution can be obtained within a

field which is imaged at once, without scanning or dithering motions, there-
fore yielding an enormous improvement in exposure time for each source in
the field.
   The only problem is that an x-ray telescope had to be invented and the
technology necessary for its fabrication had to be developed. It ultimately
took about 20 years between the conception of the x-ray telescope in 1959
and its first use for stellar x-ray astronomy in 1979. An x-ray telescope is quite
different from a visible light telescope since the wavelength of x-ray photons
is comparable to atomic dimensions. According to Lorentz’ dispersion theo-
ry, it is clear that the index of refraction of x-rays is less than one, which
makes optical systems based on refraction essentially impractical, as was real-
ized by Röntgen himself in his classical experiment of 1895. However, x-rays
can be efficiently externally reflected by mirrors, provided only that the re-
flection takes place at very small angles with respect to the mirror’s surface.
Hans Wolter had already discussed in the 40’s and 50’s the possibility of using
images formed by reflection for microscopy. He showed that using a double
reflection from a system of coaxial mirrors consisting of paraboloid and hy-
perboloid, one could achieve systems with a reasonably large field (1o) cor-
rected for spherical aberrations and coma. Theoretically, therefore, the sys-
tem was feasible, although the difficulties of construction given the tiny
dimension of the systems for microscopy were impossible to overcome
(Fig. 13). I persuaded myself, however, that in the corresponding optical de-

signs to be used for telescopes, which required much larger scales (meters
rather than microns), such difficulties would not be severe.
   In our 1960 paper we described a system that could achieve sensitivities of
5 x 10-14 erg cm -2 s-1 and angular resolutions of 2 arc minutes. The improve-
ment in sensitivity was 106–107 times more than for any detector then current
and the improvement in angular resolution about a factor of 103.
Unfortunately it took a long time to develop this technology (Fig. 14)
(Giacconi et al., 1969).32 The first primitive pictures of the Sun with an x-ray
telescope were obtained in 1965. Giuseppe Vaiana took over leadership of
our solar physics program in 1967. In 1973 a high resolution x-ray telescope
studied the Sun over a period of many months with a field large enough to
image the disk and nearby corona and with angular resolution finer than
5 arc seconds (Fig. 15) (Vaiana and Rosner, 1978).33
   It was not until 1979 that a fully instrumented x-ray telescope suitable for
the detection and study of the much weaker stellar fluxes could be launched.

The new satellite, which became known as “Einstein,” was a real astronomical
observatory (Fig. 16) (Giacconi et al., 1979).34 In the focal plane of the tele-
scope one could use image detectors with angular resolutions of a few arc sec-
onds, comparable to those used in visible light. The sensitivity with respect to
point sources was increased by 103 with respect to UHURU and 106 with re-
spect to Sco X-1. Spectroscopy could be carried out with a spectral resolving
power of 500.
   This substantial technical improvement made possible the detection of all
types of astrophysical phenomena (Table 3). Auroras due to the Jovian Belts,
main sequence stars of all types, novae and supernovae were detected. Binary
x-ray sources could be studied anywhere in our own galaxy as well as in exter-
nal galaxies (Fig. 17). Normal galaxies as well as galaxies with active galactic
nuclei, such as Seyferts and B Lac, could be detected at very great distances.
The most distant quasars ever detected in visible light or radio could be con-
veniently studied. The sources of the mysterious, isotropic extragalactic back-
ground could begin to be resolved.
   But to come back to the study of the intergalactic plasma, it is in the study
of x-ray emissions from clusters of galaxies that the Einstein observations have

had some of the most profound impact. The ability to image the hot plasma
has given us the means to study in detail the distribution of the gravitational
potential which contains both gas and galaxies. This study could only be car-
ried out with some difficulty by studying the individual galaxies which, even
though rather numerous in rich clusters, did not yield sufficient statistical ac-
curacy. The x-ray study has revealed a complex morphology with some clus-
ters exhibiting symmetry and a central maximum of density, which demon-
strates an advanced stage of dynamical evolution; but many others show
complex structures with two or more maxima. This morphology shows that
the merging of the clusters’ substructures is not yet completed. The relative
youth of many of these clusters had not been sufficiently appreciated previ-
ously. The discovery of x-ray emission in clusters is therefore used to study
one of the most interesting open questions of modern cosmology, namely,
the formation and development of structures in the early epoch of the life of
the Universe. Piero Rosati (Rosati et al., 2002)35 has pushed this work to very
distant clusters (z ~ 1.2) by use of the “ROSAT” Satellite, a splendid successor
to “Einstein,” built at the Max-Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Research by
Joachim Trümper and Günther Hasinger and their group.

5.0 CURRENT RESEARCH WITH CHANDRA
Harvey Tananbaum and I reproposed the concept of a 1.2 meter diameter
telescope to NASA in 1976. Tananbaum, who had been project scientist on
UHURU and scientific program manager on “Einstein,” gave leadership to
the Chandra program and brought it to successful conclusion after I left
Harvard in 1981. Chandra has met or exceeded all of our expectations.
Comparison of the pictures of the Crab Nebula pulsar by “Einstein” and by
Chandra (Fig. 18) shows the great improvement in the sensitivity and angular
resolution achieved (Tananbaum and Weisskopf, 2001).36
   I was able to use Chandra for one million seconds to solve the problem of
the sources of the x-ray background, a problem that had remained unsolved
since its discovery in 1962 (Fig. 19) (Giacconi et al., 2002).37 Owing to the
great sensitivity and angular resolution of Chandra, we were able to resolve
the apparently diffused emission into millions of individual sources. They are

active galactic nuclei, quasars, and normal galaxies. The gain in sensitivity
that this represents is illustrated in Fig. 20. In Fig. 21, a reminder that x-ray as-
tronomy now involves many groups in the world with distinct and essential
contributions.


6.0 THE FUTURE OF X-RAY ASTRONOMY
I would like to conclude by attempting to answer the simple question: Why is
x-ray astronomy important? The reason is that this radiation reveals the exis-
tence of astrophysical processes where matter has been heated to tempera-
tures of millions of degrees or in which particles have been accelerated to rel-
ativistic energies. The x-ray photons are particularly suited to study these
processes because they are numerous, because they penetrate cosmological
distances, and because they can be focused by special telescopes. This last
property significantly distinguishes x-ray from -ray astronomy. However, in a
more fundamental way, high energy astronomy has great importance in the
study of the Universe because high energy phenomena play a crucial role in
the dynamics of the Universe.
   Gone is the classical conception of the Universe as a serene and majestic
ensemble whose slow evolution is regulated by the consumption of the nu-
clear fuel. The Universe we know today is pervaded by the echoes of enor-
mous explosions and rent by abrupt changes of luminosity on large energy
scales. From the initial explosion to formation of galaxies and clusters, from
the birth to the death of stars, high energy phenomena are the norm and not
the exception in the evolution of the Universe.
