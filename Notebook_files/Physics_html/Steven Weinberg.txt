Our job in physics is to see things simply, to understand a great many
complicated phenomena in a unified way, in terms of a few simple princi-
ples. At times, our efforts are illuminated by a brilliant experiment, such as
the 1973 discovery of neutral current neutrino reactions. But even in the
dark times between experimental breakthroughs, there always continues a
steady evolution of theoretical ideas, leading almost imperceptibly to
changes in previous beliefs. In this talk, I want to discuss the development
of two lines of thought in theoretical physics. One of them is the slow
growth in our understanding of symmetry, and in particular, broken or
hidden symmetry. The other is the old struggle to come to terms with the
infinities in quantum field theories. To a remarkable degree, our present
detailed theories of elementary particle interactions can be understood
deductively, as consequences of symmetry principles and of a principle of
renormalizability which is invoked to deal with the infinities. I will also
briefly describe how the convergence of these lines of thought led to my
own work on the unification of weak and electromagnetic interactions. For
the most part, my talk will center on my own gradual education in these
matters, because that is one subject on which I can speak with some
confidence. With rather less confidence, I will also try to look ahead, and
suggest what role these lines of thought may play in the physics of the
future.
   Symmetry principles made their appearance in twentieth century phys-
ics in 1905 with Einstein’s identification of the invariance group of space
and time. With this as a precedent, symmetries took on a character in
physicists’ minds as a priori principles of universal validity, expressions of
the simplicity of nature at its deepest level. So it was painfully difficult in
the 1930’s to realize that there are internal symmetries, such as isospin
conservation, [1] having nothing to do with space and time, symmetries
which are far from self-evident, and that only govern what are now called
the strong interactions. The 1950’s saw the discovery of another internal
symmetry - the conservation of strangeness [2] - which is not obeyed by
the weak interactions, and even one of the supposedly sacred symmetries
of space-time - parity - was also found to be violated by weak interactions.
[3] Instead of moving toward unity, physicists were learning that different

interactions are apparently governed by quite different symmetries. Mat-
ters became yet more confusing with the recognition in the early 1960’s of
a symmetry group - the “eightfold way” - which is not even an exact
symmetry of the strong interactions. [4]
    These are all “global” symmetries, for which the symmetry transforma-
 tions do not depend on position in space and time. It had been recognized
[5] in the 1920’s that quantum electrodynamics has another symmetry of a
far more powerful kind, a “local” symmetry under transformations in
which the electron field suffers a phase change that can vary freely from
point to point in space-time, and the electromagnetic vector potential
undergoes a corresponding gauge transformation. Today this would be
called a U(1) gauge symmetry, because a simple phase change can be
thought of as multiplication by a 1 x 1 unitary matrix. The extension to
more complicated groups was made by Yang and Mills [6] in 1954 in a
seminal paper in which they showed how to construct an SU(2) gauge
theory of strong interactions. (The name “SU(2)” means that the group of
symmetry transformations consists of 2 x 2 unitary matrices that are
“special,” in that they have determinant unity). But here again it seemed
that the symmetry if real at all would have to be approximate, because at
least on a naive level gauge invariance requires that vector bosons like the
photon would have to be massless, and it seemed obvious that the strong
interactions are not mediated by massless particles. The old question
remained: if symmetry principles are an expression of the simplicity of
nature at its deepest level, then how can there be such a thing as an
approximate symmetry? Is nature only approximately simple?
    Some time in 1960 or early 1961, I learned of an idea which had
originated earlier in solid state physics and had been brought into particle
physics by those like Heisenberg, Nambu, and Goldstone, who had worked
in both areas. It was the idea of “broken symmetry,” that the Hamiltonian
and commutation relations of a quantum theory could possess an exact
symmetry, and that the physical states might nevertheless not provide neat
representations of the symmetry. In particular, a symmetry of the Hamil-
tonian might turn out to be not a symmetry of the vacuum.
   As theorists sometimes do, I fell in love with this idea. But as often
happens with love affairs, at first I was rather confused about its implica-
tions. I thought (as turned out, wrongly) that the approximate symmetries
 - parity, isospin, strangeness, the eight-fold way - might really be exact a
priori symmetry principles, and that the observed violations of these sym-
metries might somehow be brought about by spontaneous symmetry
breaking. It was therefore rather disturbing for me to hear of a result of
Goldstone, [7] that in at least one simple case the spontaneous breakdown
of a continuous symmetry like isospin would necessarily entail the exis-
tence of a massless spin zero particle - what would today be called a
“Goldstone boson.” It seemed obvious that there could not exist any new
type of massless particle of this sort which would not already have been
discovered.

   I had long discussions of this problems with Goldstone at Madison in the
summer of 1961, and then with Salam while I was his guest at Imperial
College in 196l-62. The three of us soon were able to show that Gold-
stone bosons must in fact occur whenever a symmetry like isospin or
strangeness is spontaneously broken, and that their masses then remain
zero to all orders of perturbation theory. I remember being so discouraged
by these zero masses that when we wrote our joint paper on the subject, [8]
I added an epigraph to the paper to underscore the futility of supposing
that anything could be explained in terms of a non-invariant vacuum state:
it was Lear’s retort to Cordelia, “Nothing will come of nothing: speak
again.” Of course, The Physical Review protected the purity of the physics
literature, and removed the quote. Considering the future of the non-
invariant vacuum in theoretical physics, it was just as well.
   There was actually an exception to this proof, pointed out soon after-
wards by Higgs, Kibble, and others. [9] They showed that if the broken
symmetry is a local, gauge symmetry, like electromagnetic gauge in-
variance, then although the Goldstone bosons exist formally, and are in
some sense real, they can be eliminated by a gauge transformation, so that
they do not appear as physical particles. The missing Goldstone bosons
appear instead as helicity zero states of the vector particles, which thereby
acquire a mass.
   I think that at the time physicists who heard about this exception gener-
ally regarded it as a technicality. This may have been because of a new
development in theoretical physics which suddenly seemed to change the
role of Goldstone bosons from that of unwanted intruders to that of
welcome friends.
   In 1964 Adler and Weisberger [10] independently derived sum rules
which gave the ratio          of axial-vector to vector coupling constants in
beta decay in terms of pion-nucleon cross sections. One way of looking at
their calculation, (perhaps the most common way at the time) was as an
analogue to the old dipole sum rule in atomic physics: a complete set of
hadronic states is inserted in the commutation relations of the axial vector
currents. This is the approach memorialized in the name of “current
algebra.” [11] But there was another way of looking at the Adler-Weis-
berger sum rule. One could suppose that the strong interactions have an
approximate symmetry, based on the group SU(2) x SU(2), and that this
symmetry is spontaneously broken, giving rise among other things to the
nucleon masses. The pion is then identified as (approximately) a Gold-
stone boson, with small non-zero mass, an idea that goes back to Nambu.
[12] Although the SU(2) X SU(2) symmetry is spontaneously broken, it still
has a great deal of predictive power, but its predictions take the form of
approximate formulas, which give the matrix elements for low energy
pionic reactions. In this approach, the Adler-Weisberger sum rule is ob-
tained by using the predicted pion nucleon scattering lengths in conjunc-
tion with a well-known sum rule [13], which years earlier had been derived
from the dispersion relations for pion-nucleon scattering.

    In these calculations one is really using not only the fact that the strong
interactions have a spontaneously broken approximate SU(2) X SU(2) sym-
metry, but also that the currents of this symmetry group are, up to an
overall constant, to be identified with the vector and axial vector currents
of beta decay. (With this assumption             gets into the picture through
the Goldberger-Treiman relation, [14] which gives                in terms of the
pion decay constant and the pion nucleon coupling.) Here, in this relation
between the currents of the symmetries of the strong interactions and the
physical currents of beta decay, there was a tantalizing hint of a deep
connection between the weak interactions and the strong interactions. But
this connection was not really understood for almost a decade.
    I spent the years 1965-67 happily developing the implications of spon-
taneous symmetry breaking for the strong interactions. [15] It was this
work that led to my 1967 paper on weak and electromagnetic unification.
But before I come to that I have to go back in history and pick up one
other line of though, having to do with the problem of infinities in
quantum field theory.
    I believe that it was Oppenheimer and Waller in 1930 [16] who indepen-
dently first noted that quantum field theory when pushed beyond the
lowest approximation yields ultraviolet divergent results for radiative self
energies. Professor Waller told me last night that when he described this
result to Pauli, Pauli did not believe it. It must have seemed that these
infinities would be a disaster for the quantum field theory that had just
been developed by Heisenberg and Pauli in 1929-30. And indeed, these
infinites did lead to a sense of discouragement about quantum field the-
ory, and many attempts were made in the 1930’s and early 1940’s to find
alternatives. The problem was solved (at least for quantum electrodynam-
ics) after the war, by Feynman, Schwinger, and Tomonaga [17] and Dyson
[19]. It was found that all infinities disappear if one identifies the observed
finite values of the electron mass and charge, not with the parameters m
and e appearing in the Lagrangian, but with the electron mass and charge
that are calculated from m and e, when one takes into account the fact that
the electron and photon are always surrounded with clouds of virtual
photons and electron-positron pairs [18]. Suddenly all sorts of calculations
became possible, and gave results in spectacular agreement with experi-
ment.
   But even after this success, opinions differed as to the significance of the
ultraviolet divergences in quantum field theory. Many thought-and some
still do think-that what had been done was just to sweep the real problems
under the rug. And it soon became clear that there was only a limited class
of so-called “renormalizable” theories in which the infinities could be
eliminated by absorbing them into a redefinition, or a “renormalization,”
of a finite number of physical parameters. (Roughly speaking, in renorma-
lizable theories no coupling constants can have the dimensions of negative
powers of mass. But every time we add a field or a space-time derivative to
an interaction, we reduce the dimensionality of the associated coupling

constant. So only a few simple types of interaction can be renormalizable.)
In particular, the existing Fermi theory of weak interactions clearly was
not renormalizable. (The Fermi coupling constant has the dimensions of
[ m a s s ]-2.) The sense of discouragement about quantum field theory per-
sisted into the 1950’s and 1960’s.
   I learned about renormalization theory as a graduate student, mostly by
reading Dyson’s papers. [19] From the beginning it seemed to me to be a
wonderful thing that very few quantum field theories are renormalizable.
Limitations of this sort are, after all, what we most want , not mathematical
methods which can make sense of an infinite variety of physically irrele-
vant theories, but methods which carry constraints, because these con-
straints may point the way toward the one true theory. In particular, I was
impressed by the fact that quantum electrodynamics could in a sense be
derived from symmetry principles and the constraints of renormalizability;
the only Lorentz invariant and gauge invariant renormalizable Lagrangian
for photons and electrons is precisely the orginal Dirac Lagrangian of
QED. Of course, that is not the way Dirac came to his theory. He had the
benefit of the information gleaned in centuries of experimentation on
electromagnetism, and in order to fix the final form of his theory he relied
on ideas of simplicity (specifically, on what is sometimes called minimal
electromagnetic coupling). But we have to look ahead, to try to make
theories of phenomena which have not been so well studied experimental-
ly, and we may not be able to trust purely formal ideas of simplicity. I
thought that renormalizability might be the key criterion, which also in a
more general context would impose a precise kind of simplicity on our
theories and help us to pick out the one true physical theory out of the
infinite variety of conceivable quantum field theories. As I will explain
later, I would say this a bit differently today, but I am more convinced than
ever that the use of renormalizability as a constraint on our theories of the
observed interactions is a good strategy. Filled with enthusiasm for renor-
malization theory, I wrote my Ph.D. thesis under Sam Treiman in 1957 on
the use of a limited version of renormalizability to set constraints on the
weak interactions, [20] and a little later I worked out a rather tough little
theorem [21] which completed the proof by Dyson [19] and Salam [22] that
ultraviolet divergences really do cancel out to all orders in nominally
renormalizable theories. But none of this seemed to help with the impor-
tant problem, of how to make a renormalizable theory of weak interac-
tions.
   Now, back to 1967. I had been considering the implications of the
broken SU(2) x SU(2) symmetry of the strong interactions, and I thought
of trying out the idea that perhaps the SU(2) x SU(2) symmetry was a
“local,” not merely a “global,” symmetry. That is, the strong interactions
might be described by something like a Yang-Mills theory, but in addition
to the vector    mesons of the Yang-Mills theory, there would also be axial
vector Al mesons. To give the        meson a mass, it was necessary to insert a
common        and Al mass term in the Lagrangian, and the spontaneous


548                               Physics 1979


breakdown of the SU(2) x SU(2) symmetry would then split the            and Al
by something like the Higgs mechanism, but since the theory would not be
gauge invariant the pions would remain as physical Goldstone bosons.
This theory gave an intriguing result, that the          mass ratio should be
      and in trying to understand this result without relying on perturbation
theory, I discovered certain sum rules, the “spectral function sum rules,”
[23] which turned out to have variety of other uses. But the SU(2) x SU(2)
theory was not gauge invariant, and hence it could not be renormalizable,
[24] so I was not too enthusiastic about it. [25] Of course, if I did not insert
the        mass term in the Lagrangian, then the theory would be gauge
invariant and renormalizable, and the Al would be massive. But then
there would be no pions and the       mesons would be massless, in obvious
contradiction (to say the least) with observation.
   At some point in the fall of 1967, I think while driving to my office at
M.I.T., it occurred to me that I had been applying the right ideas to the
wrong problem. It is not the       mesons that is massless: it is the photon.
And its partner is not the Al, but the massive intermediate boson, which
since the time of Yukawa had been suspected to be the mediator of the
weak interactions. The weak and electromagnetic interactions could then
be described [26] in a unified way in terms of an exact but spontaneously
broken gauge symmetry. [Of course, not necessarily SU(2) X SU(2)]. And
this theory would be renormalizable like quantum electrodynamics be-
cause it is gauge invariant like quantum electrodynamics.
   It was not difficult to develop a concrete model which embodied these
ideas. I had little confidence then in my understanding of strong interac-
tions, so I decided to concentrate on leptons. There are two left-handed
electron-type leptons, the      and      and one right-handed electron-type
lepton, the       so I started with the group U(2)     U(1): all unitary 2 x 2
matrices acting on the left-handed e-type leptons, together with all unitary
 1 X 1 matrices acting on the right-handed e-type lepton. Breaking up U(2)
into unimodular transformations and phase transformations, one could
say that the group was SU(2) X U( 1) X U( 1). But then one of the U(l)‘s
could be identified with ordinary lepton number, and since lepton number
appears to be conserved and there is no massless vector particle coupled to
it, I decided to exclude it from the group. This left the four-parameter
group SU(2) x U( 1). The spontaneous breakdown of SU(2) x U( 1) to the
U(1) of ordinary electromagnetic gauge invariance would give masses to
three of the four vector gauge bosons: the charged bosons W ± , and a
neutral boson that I called the Z 0. The fourth boson would automatically
remain massless, and could be identified as the photon. Knowing the
strength of the ordinary charged current weak interactions like beta decay
which are mediated by W ± , the mass of the W± was then determined as
about 40              where is the                angle.
   To go further, one had to make some hypothesis about the mechanism
for the breakdown of SU (2) x U (1). The only kind of field in a renormali-
zable SU(2) X U(1) theory whose vacuum expectation values could give the

electron a mass is a spin zero SU(2) doublet                               so for simplicity I
assumed that these were the only scalar fields in the theory. The mass of
t h e Z0 w a s t h e n d e t e r m i n e d a s a b o u t 8 0 G e V / s i n    This fixed the
strength of the neutral current weak interactions. Indeed, just as in QED,
once one decides on the menu of fields in the theory all details of the
theory are completely determined by symmetry principles and renormal-
izability, with just a few free parameters: the lepton charge and masses, the
Fermi coupling constant of beta decay, the mixing angle                       and the mass of
the scalar particle. (It was of crucial importance to impose the constraint of
renormalizability; otherwise weak interactions would receive contributions
from SU(2)xU(I) - invariant four-fermion couplings as well as from vector
boson exchange, and the theory would lose most of its predictive power.)
The naturalness of the whole theory is well demonstrated by the fact that
much the same theory was independently developed [27] by Salam in
1968.
    The next question now was renormalizability. The Feynman rules for
Yang-Mills theories with unbroken gauge symmetries had been worked
out [28] by deWitt, Faddeev and Popov and others, and it was known that
such theories are renormalizable. But in 1967 I did not know how to prove
that this renormalizability was not spoiled by the spontaneous symmetry
breaking. I worked on the problem on and off for several years, partly in
collaboration with students, [29] but I made little progress. With hindsight,
my main difficulty was that in quantizing the vector fields I adopted a
gauge now known as the unitarity gauge [30]: this gauge has several
wonderful advantages, it exhibits the true particle spectrum of the theory,
but it has the disadvantage of making renormalizability totally obscure.
   Finally, in 1971 ‘t Hooft [31] showed in a beautiful paper how the
problem could be solved. He invented a gauge, like the “Feynman gauge”
in QED, in which the Feynman rules manifestly lead to only a finite
number of types of ultraviolet divergence. It was also necessary to show
that these infinities satisfied essentially the same constraints as the Lagran-
gian itself, so that they could be absorbed into a redefinition of the
parameters of the theory. (This was plausible, but not easy to prove,
because a gauge invariant theory can be quantized only after one has
picked a specific gauge, so it is not obvious that the ultraviolet divergences
satisfy the same gauge invariance constraints as the Lagrangian itself.) The
proof was subsequently completed [32] by Lee and Zinn-Justin and by ‘t
Hooft and Veltman. More recently, Becchi, Rouet and Stora [33] have
invented an ingenious method for carrying out this sort of proof, by using
a global supersymmetry of gauge theories which is preserved even when
we choose a specific gauge.
   I have to admit that when I first saw ‘t Hooft’s paper in 1971, I was not
convinced that he had found the way to’ prove renormalizability. The
trouble was not with ‘t Hooft, but with me: I was simply not familiar
enough with the path integral formalism on which ‘t Hooft’s work was
based, and I wanted to see a derivation of the Feynman rules in ‘t Hooft’s

gauge from canonical quantization. That was soon supplied (for a limited
class of gauge theories) by a paper of Ben Lee, [34] and after Lee’s paper I
was ready to regard the renormalizability of the unified theory as essential-
ly proved.
   By this time, many theoretical physicists were becoming convinced of the
general approach that Salam and I had adopted: that is, the weak and
electromagnetic interactions are governed by some group of exact local
gauge symmetries; this group is spontaneously broken to U(l), giving mass
to all the vector bosons except the photon; and the theory is renormaliza-
ble. What was not so clear was that our specific simple model was the one
chosen by nature. That, of course, was a matter for experiment to decide.
   It was obvious even back in 1967 that the best way to test the theory
would be by searching for neutral current weak interactions, mediated by
the neutral intermediate vector boson, the Z0. Of course, the possibility of
neutral currents was nothing new. There had been speculations [35] about
possible neutral currents as far back as 1937 by Gamow and Teller,
Kemmer, and Wentzel, and again in 1958 by Bludman and Leite-Lopes.
Attempts at a unified weak and electromagnetic theory had been made
[36] by Glashow and Salam and Ward in the early 1960’s, and these had
neutral currents with many of the features that Salam and I encountered
in developing the 1967-68 theory. But since one of the predictions of our
theory was a value for the mass of the Z 0 , it made a definite prediction of
the strength of the neutral currents. More important, now we had a
comprehensive quantum field theory of the weak and electromagnetic
interactions that was physically and mathematically satisfactory in the same
sense as was quantum electrodynamics-a theory that treated photons and
intermediate vector bosons on the same footing, that was based on an exact
symmetry principle, and that allowed one to carry calculations to any
desired degree of accuracy. To test this theory, it had now become urgent
to settle the question of the existence of the neutral currents.
   Late in 1971, I carried out a study of the experimental possibilites. [37]
The results were striking. Previous experiments had set upper bounds on
the rates of neutral current processes which were rather low, and many
people had received the impression that neutral currents were pretty well
ruled out, but I found that in fact the 1967-68 theory predicted quite low
rates, low enough in fact to have escaped clear detection up to that time.
For instance, experiments [38] a few years earlier had found an upper
bound of 0.12 ± 0.06 on the ratio of a neutral current process, the elastic
scattering of muon neutrinos by protons, to the corresponding charged
current process, in which a muon is produced. I found a predicted ratio of
0.15 to 0.25, depending on the value of the Z 0     mixing angle    So there
was every reason to look a little harder.
   As everyone knows, neutral currents were finally discovered [39] in
1973. There followed years of careful experimental study on the detailed
properties of the neutral currents. It would take me too far from my
subject to survey these experiments, [40] so I will just say that they have

confirmed the 1967-68 theory with steadily improving precision for neu-
trino-nucleon and neutrino-electron neutral current reactions, and since
the remarkable SLAC-Yale experiment [41] last year, for the electron-
nucleon neutral current as well.
   This is all very nice. But I must say that I would not have been too
disturbed if it had turned out that the correct theory was based on some
other spontaneously broken gauge group, with very different neutral
currents. One possibility was a clever SU(2) theory proposed in 1972 by
Georgi and Glashow, [42] which has no neutral currents at all. The impor-
tant thing to me was the idea of an exact spontaneously broken gauge
symmetry, which connects the weak and electromagnetic interactions, and
allows these interactions to be renormalizable. Of this I was convinced, if
only because it fitted my conception of the way that nature ought to be.
   There were two other relevant theoretical developments in the early
 1970’s, before the discovery of neutral currents, that I must mention here.
One is the important work of Glashow, Iliopoulos, and Maiani on the
charmed quark. [43] Their work provided a solution to what otherwise
would have been a serious problem, that of neutral strangeness changing
currents. I leave this topic for Professor Glashow’s talk. The other theoreti-
cal development has to do specifically with the strong interactions, but it
will take us back to one of the themes of my talk, the theme of symmetry.
   In 1973, Politzer and Gross and Wilczek discovered [44] a remarkable
property of Yang-Mills theories which they called “asymptotic freedom”
- the effective coupling constant [45] decreases to zero as the characteris-
tic energy of a process goes to infinity. It seemed that this might explain
the experimental fact that the nucleon behaves in high energy deep inelas-
tic electron scattering as if it consists of essentially free quarks. [46] But
there was a problem. In order to give masses to the vector bosons in a
gauge theory of strong interactions one would want to include strongly
interacting scalar fields, and these would generally destroy asymptotic
freedom. Another difficulty, one that particularly bothered me, was that in
a unified theory of weak and electromagnetic interactions the fundamen-
tal weak coupling is of the same order as the electronic charge, e, so the
effects of virtual intermediate vector bosons would introduce much too
large violations of parity and strangeness conservation, of order 1/137,
into the strong interactions of the scalars with each other and with the
quarks. [47] At some point in the spring of 1973 it occurred to me (and
independently to Gross and Wilczek) that one could do away with strongly
interacting scalar fields altogether, allowing the strong interaction gauge
symmetry to remain unbroken so that the vector bosons, or “gluons”, are
massless, and relying on the increase of the strong forces with increasing
distance to explain why quarks as well as the massless gluons are not seen
in the laboratory. [48] Assuming no strongly interacting scalars, three
“colors” of quarks (as indicated by earlier work of several authors [49]),
and an SU(3) gauge group, one then had a specific theory of strong

   Experiments since then have increasingly confirmed QCD as the correct
theory of strong interactions. What concerns me here, though, is its impact
on our understanding of symmetry principles. Once again, the constraints
of gauge invariance and renormalizability proved enormously powerful.
These constraints force the Lagrangian to be so simple, that the strong
interactions in QCD must conserve strangeness, charge conjugation, and
(apart from problems [50] having to do with instantons) parity. One does
not have to assume these symmetries as a priori principles; there is simply
no way that the Lagrangian can be complicated enough to violate them.
With one additional assumption, that the u and d quarks have relatively
small masses, the strong interactions must also satisfy the approximate
SU(2) X SU(2) symmetry of current algebra, which when spontaneously
broken leaves us with isospin. If the s quark mass is also not too large, then
one gets the whole eight-fold way as an approximate symmetry of the
strong interactions. And the breaking of the SU(3)xSU(3) symmetry by
quark masses has just the (3,3)+(3,3) form required to account for the
pion-pion scattering lengths [15] and Gell-Mann-Okubo mass formu-
las. Furthermore, with weak and electromagnetic interactions also de-
 scribed by a gauge theory, the weak currents are necessarily just the
currents associated with these strong interaction symmetries. In other
words, pretty much the whole pattern of approximate symmetries of
strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions that puzzled us so much in
the 1950’s and 1960’s now stands explained as a simple consequence of
strong, weak, and electromagnetic gauge invariance, plus renormalizabi-
lity. Internal symmetry is now at the point where space-time symmetry was
in Einstein’s day. All the approximate internal symmetries are explained
dynamically. On a fundamental level, there are no approximate or partial
symmetries; there are only exact symmetries which govern all interactions.
   I now want to look ahead a bit, and comment on the possible future
development of the ideas of symmetry and renormalizability.
   We are still confronted with the question whether the scalar particles
that are responsible for the spontaneous breakdown of the electroweak
gauge symmetry SU(2) X U(1) are really elementary. If they are, then spin
zero semi-weakly decaying “Higgs bosons” should be found at energies
comparable with those needed to produce the intermediate vector bosons.
On the other hand, it may be that the scalars are composites. [51] The
Higgs bosons would then be indistinct broad states at very high mass,
analogous to the possible s-wave enhancement in            scattering. There
would probably also exist lighter, more slowly decaying, scalar particles of
a rather different type, known as pseudo-Goldstone bosons. [52] And
there would have to exist a new class of “extra strong” interactions [53] to
provide the binding force, extra strong in the sense that asymptotic free-
dom sets in not at a few hundred MeV, as in QCD, but at a few hundred
GeV. This “extra strong” force would be felt by new families of fermions,
and would give these fermions masses of the order of several hundred
GeV. We shall see.

   Of the four (now three) types of interactions, only gravity has resisted
incorporation into a renormalizable quantum field theory. This may just
mean that we are not being clever enough in our mathematical treatment
of general relativity. But there is another possibility that seems to me quite
plausible. The constant of gravity defines a unit of energy known as the
Planck energy, about 10 1 9 GeV. This is the energy at which gravitation
becomes effectively a strong interaction, so that at this energy one can no
longer ignore its ultraviolet divergences. It may be that there is a whole
world of new physics with unsuspected degrees of freedom at these enor-
mous energies, and that general relativity does not provide an adequate
framework for understanding the physics of these superhigh energy de-
grees of freedom. When we explore gravitation or other ordinary phe-
nomena, with particle masses and energies no greater than a TeV or so, we
may be learning only about an “effective” field theory; that is, one in which
superheavy degrees of freedom do not explicitly appear, but the coupling
parameters implicitly represent sums over these hidden degrees of free-
dom.
   To see if this makes sense, let us suppose it is true, and ask what kinds of
interactions we would expect on this basis to find at ordinary energy. By
“integrating out” the superhigh energy degrees of freedom in a funda-
mental theory, we generally encounter a very complicated effective field
theory - so complicated, in fact, that it contains all interactions allowed by
symmetry principles. But where dimensional analysis tells us that a cou-
pling constant is a certain power of some mass, that mass is likely to be a
typical superheavy mass, such as 10 GeV. The infinite variety of non-
                                         19



renormalizable interactions in the effective theory have coupling constants
with the dimensionality of negative powers of mass, so their effects are
suppressed at ordinary energies by powers of energy divided by super-
heavy masses. Thus the only interactions that we can detect at ordinary
energies are those that are renormalizable in the usual sense, plus any non-
renormalizable interactions that produce effects which, although tiny, are
somehow exotic enough to be seen.
   One way that a very weak interaction could be detected is for it to be
coherent and of long range, so that it can add up and have macroscopic
effects. It has been shown [54] that the only particles whose exchange
could produce such forces are massless particles of spin 0, 1, or 2. And
furthermore, Lorentz’s invariance alone is enough to show that the long-
range interactions produced by any particle of mass zero and spin 2 must
be governed by general relativity. [55] Thus from this point of view we
should not be too surprised that gravitation is the only interaction discov-
ered so far that does not seem to be described by a renormalizable field
theory - it is almost the only superweak interaction that could have been
detected. And we should not be surprised to find that gravity is well
described by general relativity at macroscopic scales, even if we do not
think that general relativity applies at 10 19 G e V .

   Non-renormalizable effective interactions may also be detected if they
violate otherwise exact conservation laws. The leading candidates for viola-
tion are baryon and lepton conservation. It is a remarkable consequence of
the SU(3) and SU(2) x U( 1) gauge symmetries of strong, weak, and electro-
magnetic interactions, that all renormalizable interactions among known
particles automatically conserve baryon and lepton number. Thus, the fact
that ordinary matter seems pretty stable, that proton decay has not been
seen, should not lead us to the conclusion that baryon and lepton conserva-
tion are fundamental conservation laws. To the accuracy with which they
have been verified, baryon and lepton conservation can be explained as
dynamical consequences of other symmetries, in the same way that strange-
ness conservation has been explained within QCD. But superheavy parti-
cles may exist, and these particles may have unusual SU(3) or SU(2) x
SU(1) transformation properties, and in this case, there is no reason why
their interactions should conserve baryon or lepton number. I doubt that
they would. Indeed, the fact that the universe seems to contain an excess of
baryons over antibaryons should lead us to suspect that baryon non-
conserving processes have actually occurred. If effects of a tiny nonconser-
vation of baryon or lepton number such as proton decay or neutrino
masses are discovered experimentally, we will then be left with gauge
symmetries as the only true internal symmetries of nature, a conclusion
that I would regard as most satisfactory.
   The idea of a new scale of superheavy masses has arisen in another way.
[56] If any sort of “grand unification” of strong and electroweak gauge
couplings is to be possible, then one would expect all of the SU(3) and
SU(2) x U( 1) gauge coupling constants to be of comparable magnitude. (In
particular, if SU(3) and SU(2) x U(1) are subgroups of a larger simple
group, then the ratios of the squared couplings are fixed as rational
numbers of order unity.[57]) But this appears in contradiction with the
obvious fact that the strong interactions are stronger than the weak and
electromagnetic interactions. In 1974 Georgi, Quinn and I suggested that
the grand unification scale, at which the couplings are comparable, is at an
enormous energy, and that the reason that the strong coupling is so much
larger than the electroweak couplings at ordinary energies is that QCD is
asymptotically free, so that its effective coupling constant rises slowly as the
energy drops from the grand unification scale to ordinary values. The
change of the strong couplings is very slow (like                  so the grand
unification scale must be enormous. We found that for a fairly large class
of theories the grand unification scale comes out to be in the neighbor-
hood of 1016 GeV, an energy not all that different from the Planck energy
of 10 19 GeV. The nucleon lifetime is very difficult to estimate accurately,
but we gave a representative value of 1032 years, which may be accessible
experimentally in a few years. (These estimates have been improved in
more detailed calculations by several authors.) [58] We also calculated a
value for the mixing parameter            of about 0.2, not far from the present
experimental           of 0.23±0.01. It will be an important task for future

experiments on neutral currents to improve the precision with which
is known, to see if it really agrees with this prediction.
   In a grand unified theory, in order for elementary scalar particles to be
available to produce the spontaneous breakdown of the electroweak gauge
symmetry at a few hundred GeV, it is necessary for such particles to escape
getting superlarge masses from the spontaneous breakdown of the grand
unified gauge group. There is nothing impossible in this, but I have not
been able to think of any reason why it should happen. (The problem may
be related to the old mystery of why quantum corrections do not produce
an enormous cosmological constant; in both cases, one is concerned with
an anomalously small “super-renormalizable” term in the effective Lagran-
gian which has to be adjusted to be zero. In the case of the cosmological
constant, the adjustment must be precise to some fifty decimal places.)
With elementary scalars of small or zero bare mass, enormous ratios of
symmetry breaking scales can arise quite naturally [59]. On the other
hand, if there are no elementary scalars which escape getting superlarge
masses from the breakdown of the grand unified gauge group, then as I
have already mentioned, there must be extra strong forces to bind the
composite Goldstone and Higgs bosons that are associated with the sponta-
neous breakdown of SU(2) x U(1). Such forces can occur rather naturally
in grand unified theories. To take one example, suppose that the grand
gauge group breaks, not into SU(3) x SU(2) x U(l), but into SU(4) x SU(3)
x SU(2) x U(1). Since SU(4) is a bigger group than SU(3), its coupling
constant rises with decreasing energy more rapidly than the QCD cou-
pling, so the SU(4) force becomes strong at a much higher energy than the
few hundred MeV at which the QCD force becomes strong. Ordinary
quarks and leptons would be neutral under SU(4), so they would not feel
this force, but other fermions might carry SU(4) quantum numbers, and so
get rather large masses. One can even imagine a sequence of increasingly
large subgroups of the grand gauge group, which would fill in the vast
energy range up to 1015 or 1019 GeV with particle masses that are produced
by these successively stronger interactions.
   If there are elementary scalars whose vacuum expectation values are
responsible for the masses of ordinary quarks and leptons, then these
masses can be affected in order α by radiative corrections involving the
superheavy vector bosons of the grand gauge group, and it will probably
be impossible to explain the value of quantities like                without a
complete grand unified theory. On the other hand, if there are no such
elementary scalars, then almost all the details of the grand unified theory
are forgotten by the effective field theory that describes physics at ordi-
nary energies, and it ought to be possible to calculate quark and lepton
masses purely in terms of processes at accessible energies. Unfortunately,
no one so far has been able to see how in this way anything resembling the
 observed pattern of masses could arise. [60]
    Putting aside all these uncertainties, suppose that there is a truly funda-
 mental theory, characterized by an energy scale of order 10 16 to 1019 G e V ,

at which strong, electroweak, and gravitational interactions are all united.
It might be a conventional renormalizable quantum field theory, but at the
moment, if we include gravity, we do not see how this is possible. (I leave
the topic of supersymmetry and supergravity for Professor Salam’s talk.)
But if it is not renormalizable, what then determines the infinite set of
coupling constants that are needed to absorb all the ultraviolet divergences
of the theory?
   I think the answer must lie in the fact that the quantum field theory,
which was born just fifty years ago from the marriage of quantum mechan-
ics with relativity, is a beautiful but not very robust child. As Landau and
Kallen recognized long ago, quantum field theory at superhigh energies is
susceptible to all sorts of diseases - tachyons, ghosts, etc. and it needs
special medicine to survive. One way that a quantum field theory can avoid
these diseases is to be renormalizable and asymptotically free, but there are
other possibilities. For instance, even an infinite set of coupling constants
may approach a non-zero fixed point as the energy at which they are
measured goes to infinity. However, to require this behavior generally
imposes so many constraints on the couplings that there are only a finite
number of free parameters left[6 1] - just as for theories that are renormali-
zable in the usual sense. Thus, one way or another, I think that quantum
field theory is going to go on being very stubborn, refusing to allow us to
describe all but a small number of possible worlds, among which, we hope,
is ours.
   I suppose that I tend to be optimistic about the future of physics. And
nothing makes me more optimistic than the discovery of broken symme-
tries. In the seventh book of the Republic, Plato describes prisoners who are
chained in a cave and can see only shadows that things outside cast on the
cave wall. When released from the cave at first their eyes hurt, and for a
while they think that the shadows they saw in the cave are more real than
the objects they now see. But eventually their vision clears, and they can
understand how beautiful the real world is. We are in such a cave, impris-
oned by the limitations on the sorts of experiments we can do. In particu-
lar, we can study matter only at relatively low temperatures, where symme-
tries are likely to be spontaneously broken, so that nature does not appear
very simple or unified. We have not been able to get out of this cave, but by
looking long and hard at the shadows on the cave wall, we can at least make
out the shapes of symmetries, which though broken, are exact principles
governing all phenomena, expressions of the beauty of the world outside.

43. Glashow, S. L., Iliopoulos, J. and Maiani, L. Phys. Rev. D2, 1285 (1970). This paper was
     cited in ref. 37 as providing a possible solution to the problem of strangeness changing
     neutral currents. However, at that time I was skeptical about the quark model, so in the
     calculations of ref. 37 baryons were incorporated in the theory by taking the protons and
     neutrons to form an SU(2) doublet, with strange particles simply ignored.
