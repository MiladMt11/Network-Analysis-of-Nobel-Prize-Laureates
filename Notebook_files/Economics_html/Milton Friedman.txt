 When the Bank of Sweden established the prize for Economic Science in
 memory of Alfred Nobel (1968), there doubtless was - as there doubtless still
 remains - widespread skepticism among both scientists and the broader public
 about the appropriateness of treating economics as parallel to physics, chem-
 istry, and medicine. These are regarded as “exact sciences” in which objective,
 cumulative, definitive knowledge is possible. Economics, and its fellow social
 sciences, are regarded more nearly as branches of philosophy than of science
 properly defined, enmeshed with values at the outset because they deal with
 human behavior. Do not the social sciences, in which scholars are analyzing
 the behavior of themselves and their fellow men, who are in turn observing and
 reacting to what the scholars say, require fundamentally different methods of
 investigation than the physical and biological sciences? Should they not be
judged by different criteria?



1. SOCIAL AND NATURAL SCIENCES
I have never myself accepted this view. I believe that it reflects a misunder-
standing not so much of the character and possibilities of social science as of
the character and possibilities of natural science. In both, there is no “certain”
substantive knowledge; only tentative hypotheses that can never be “proved”,
but can only fail to be rejected, hypotheses in which we may have more or less
confidence, depending on such features as the breadth of experience they
encompass relative to their own complexity and relative to alternative hypoth-
eses, and the number of occasions on which they have escaped possible
rejection. In both social and natural sciences, the body of positive knowledge
grows by the failure of a tentative hypothesis to predict phenomena the
hypothesis professes to explain; by the patching up of that hypothesis until
someone suggests a new hypothesis that more elegantly or simply embodies
the troublesome phenomena, and so on ad infinitum. In both, experiment is
sometimes possible, sometimes not (witness meteorology). In both, no experi-
ment is ever completely controlled, and experience often offers evidence that
is the equivalent of controlled experiment. In both, there is no way to have a
self-contained closed system or to avoid interaction between the observer and
the observed. The Gödel theorem in mathematics, the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle in physics, the self-fulfilling or self-defeating prophecy in the social
sciences all exemplify these limitations.
   Of course, the different sciences deal with different subject matter, have
different bodies of evidence to draw on (for example, introspection is a more

 important source of evidence for social than for natural sciences), find different
 techniques of analysis most useful, and have achieved differential success in
 predicting the phenomena they are studying. But such differences are as great
 among, say, physics, biology, medicine, and meteorology as between any of
 them and economics.
    Even the difficult problem of separating value judgments from scientific
judgments is not unique to the social sciences. I well recall a dinner at a
 Cambridge University college when I was sitting between a fellow economist
 and R. A. Fisher, the great mathematical statistician and geneticist. My fellow
 economist told me about a student he had been tutoring on labor economics,
 who, in connection with an analysis of the effect of trade unions, remarked,
 “Well surely, Mr. X (another economist of a different political persuasion)
 would not agree with that.” My colleague regarded this experience as a terrible
 indictment of economics because it illustrated the impossibility of a value-free
 positive economic science. I turned to Sir Ronald and asked whether such an
 experience was indeed unique to social science. His answer was an impassioned
 “no”, and he proceeded to tell one story after another about how accurately
 he could infer views in genetics from political views.
    One of my great teachers, Wesley C. Mitchell, impressed on me the basic
 reason why scholars have every incentive to pursue a value-free science, what-
 ever their values and however strongly they may wish to spread and promote
 them. In order to recommend a course of action to achieve an objective, we
 must first know whether that course of action will in fact promote the objective.
 Positive scientific knowledge that enables us to predict the consequences of a
 possible course of action is clearly a prerequisite for the normative judgment
 whether that course of action is desirable. The Road to Hell is paved with
 good intentions, precisely because of the neglect of this rather obvious point.
    This point is particularly important in economics. Many countries around
 the world are today experiencing socially destructive inflation, abnormally
 high unemployment, misuse of economic resources, and, in some cases, the
 suppression of human freedom not because evil men deliberately sought to
 achieve these results, nor because of differences in values among their citizens,
  but because of erroneous judgments about the consequences of government
  measures: errors that at least in principle are capable of being corrected by
  the progress of positive economic science.
     Rather than pursue these ideas in the abstract [I have discussed the method-
 ological issues more fully in (l)], I shall illustrate the positive scientific charac-
  ter of economics by discussing a particular economic issue that has been a
  major concern of the economics profession throughout the postwar period;
  namely, the relation between inflation and unemployment. This issue is an
  admirable illustration because it has been a controversial political issue
  throughout the period, yet the drastic change that has occurred in accepted
  professional views was produced primarily by the scientific response to ex-
  perience that contradicted a tentatively accepted hypothesis - precisely the
  classical process for the revision of a scientific hypothesis.
     I cannot give here an exhaustive survey of the work that has been done on


                                  M. Friedman                                      269


 this issue or of the evidence that has led to the revision of the hypothesis. I
shall be able only to skim the surface in the hope of conveying the flavor of
 that work and that evidence and of indicating the major items requiring further
investigation.
    Professional controversy about the relation between inflation and unem-
ployment has been intertwined with controversy about the relative role of
monetary, fiscal, and other factors in influencing aggregate demand. One issue
deals with how a change in aggregate nominal demand, however produced,
works itself out through changes in employment and price levels; the other,
with the factors accounting for the changes in aggregate nominal demand.
    The two issues are closely related. The effects of a change in aggregate
 nominal demand on employment and price levels may not be independent of
 the source of the change, and conversely the effect of monetary, fiscal, or other
 forces on aggregate nominal demand may depend on how employment and
 price levels react. A full analysis will clearly have to treat the two issues jointly.
 Yet there is a considerable measure of independence between them. To a
 first approximation, the effects on employment and price levels may depend
 only on the magnitude of the change in aggregate nominal demand, not on its
 source. On both issues, professional opinion today is very different than it was
just after World War II because experience contradicted tentatively accepted
 hypotheses. Either issue could therefore serve to illustrate my main thesis.
 I have chosen to deal with only one in order to keep this lecture within
 reasonable bounds. I have chosen to make that one the relation between infla-
 tion and unemployment, because recent experience leaves me less satisfied
 with the adequacy of my earlier work on that issue than with the adequacy
 of my earlier work on the forces producing changes in aggregate nominal
 demand.


2. STAGE 1: NEGATIVELY SLOPING PHILLIPS CURVE
Professional analysis of the relation between inflation and unemployment has
gone through two stages since the end of World War II and is now entering a
third. The first stage was the acceptance of a hypothesis associated with the


270                           Economic Sciences 1976

name of A. W. Phillips that there is a stable negative relation between the
level of unemployment and the rate of change of wages - high levels of un-
employment being accompanied by falling wages, low levels of unemployment
by rising wages (24). The wage change in turn was linked to price change by
allowing for the secular increase in productivity and treating the excess of
price over wage cost as given by a roughly constant mark-up factor.
   Figure 1 illustrates this hypothesis, where I have followed the standard
practice of relating unemployment directly to price change, short-circuiting
the intermediate step through wages.
   This relation was widely interpreted as a causal relation that offered a
stable trade-off to policy makers. They could choose a low unemployment
target, such as UL. In that case they would have to accept an inflation rate of A.
There would remain the problem of choosing the measures (monetary, fiscal,
perhaps other) that would produce the level of aggregate nominal demand
required to achieve UL , but if that were done, there need be no concern about
maintaining that combination of unemployment and inflation. Alternatively,
the policy makers could choose a low inflation rate or even deflation as their
target. In that case they would have to reconcile themselves to higher unem-
ployment: U o for zero inflation, UH for deflation.
   Economists then busied themselves with trying to extract the relation
depicted in Figure 1 from evidence for different countries and periods, to
eliminate the effect of extraneous disturbances, to clarify the relation between
wage change and price change, and so on. In addition, they explored social
gains and losses from inflation on the one hand and unemployment on the
other, in order to facilitate the choice of the “right” trade-off.
   Unfortunately for this hypothesis, additional evidence failed to conform
with it. Empirical estimates of the Phillips curve relation were unsatisfactory.
More important, the inflation rate that appeared to be consistent with a speci-
fied level of unemployment did not remain fixed: in the circumstances of the
post-World War II period, when governments everywhere were seeking to
promote “full employment”, it tended in any one country to rise over time
and to vary sharply among countries. Looked at the other way, rates of
inflation that had earlier been associated with low levels of unemployment were
experienced along with high levels of unemployment. The phenomenon of
simultaneous high inflation and high unemployment increasingly forced itself
on public and professional notice, receiving the unlovely label of “stagflation”.
   Some of us were sceptical from the outset about the validity of a stable
Phillips curve, primarily on theoretical rather than empirical grounds [(2),
(3), (4)]. What mattered for employment, we argued, was not wages in dollars
or pounds or kronor but real wages - what the wages would buy in goods and
services. Low unemployment would, indeed, mean pressure for a higher real
wage - but real wages could be higher even if nominal wages were lower,
provided that prices were still lower. Similarly, high unemployment would,
indeed, mean pressure for a lower real wage - but real wages could be lower,
even if nominal wages were higher, provided prices were still higher.
   There is no need to assume a stable Phillips curve in order to explain the


                                 M. Friedman                                   271

apparent tendency for an acceleration of inflation to. reduce unemployment.
That can be explained by the impact of unanticipated changes in nominal de-
mand on markets characterized by (implicit or explicit) long-term commit-
ments with respect to both capital and labor. Long-term labor commitments
can be explained by the cost of acquiring information by employers about
employees and by employees about alternative employment opportunities plus
the specific human capital that makes an employee’s value to a particular
employer grow over time and exceed his value to other potential employers.
   Only surprises matter. If everyone anticipated that prices would rise at,
say, 20 percent a year, then this anticipation would be embodied in future
wage (and other) contracts, real wages would then behave precisely as they
would if everyone anticipated no price rise, and there would be no reason for
the 20 percent rate of inflation to be associated with a different level of unem-
ployment than a zero rate. An unanticipated change is very different, especially
in the presence of long-term commitments-themselves partly a result of the
imperfect knowledge whose effect they enhance and spread over time. Long-
term commitments mean, first, that there is not instantaneous market clearing
(as in markets for perishable foods) but only a lagged adjustment of both
prices and quantity to changes in demand or supply (as in the house-rental
market); second, that commitments entered into depend not only on current
observable prices, but also on the prices expected to prevail throughout the
term of the commitment.



3. STAGE 2: NATURAL RATE HYPOTHESIS
Proceeding along these lines, we [in particular, E. S. Phelps and myself (4),
(22), (23)] developed an alternative hypothesis that distinguished between
the short-run and long-run effects of unanticipated changes in aggregate nomi-
nal demand. Start from some initial stable position and let there be, for ex-
ample, an unanticipated acceleration of aggregate nominal demand. This will
come to each producer as an unexpectedly favorable demand for his product.
In an environment in which changes are always occurring in the relative
demand for different goods, he will not know whether this change is special to
him or pervasive. It will be rational for him to interpret it as at least partly
special and to react to it, by seeking to produce more to sell at what he now
perceives to be a higher than expected market price for future output. He will
be willing to pay higher nominal wages than he had been willing to pay before
in order to attract additional workers. The real wage that matters to him is
the wage in terms of the price of his product, and he perceives that price as
higher than before. A higher nominal wage can therefore mean a lower real
wage as perceived by him.
   To workers, the situation is different: what matters to them is the purchasing
power of wages not over the particular good they produce but over all goods
in general. Roth they and their employers are likely to adjust more slowly their
perception of prices in general - because it is more costly to acquire information
about that - than their perception of the price of the particular good they


272                            Economic Sciences 1976




produce. As a result, a rise in nominal wages may be perceived by workers as a
rise in real wages and hence call forth an increased supply, at the same time
that it is perceived by employers as a fall in real wages and hence calls forth an
increased offer of jobs. Expressed in terms of the average of perceived future
prices, real wages are lower; in terms of the perceived future average price,
real wages are higher.
   But this situation is temporary: let the higher rate of growth of aggregate
nominal demand and of prices continue, and perceptions will adjust to
reality. When they do, the initial effect will disappear, and then even be re-
versed for a time as workers and employers find themselves locked into inappro-
priate contracts. Ultimately, employment will be back at the level that pre-
vailed before the assumed unanticipated acceleration in aggregate nominal
demand.
   This alternative hypothesis is depicted in Figure 2. Each negatively sloping
curve is a Phillips curve like that in Figure 1 except that it is for a particular
anticipated or perceived rate of inflation, defined as the perceived average rate
of price change, not the average of perceived rates of individual price change
(the order of the curves would be reversed for the second concept). Start from
point E and let the rate of inflation for whatever reason move from A to B and
stay there. Unemployment would initially decline to U L . at point F, moving

along the curve defined for an anticipated rate of inflation             of A. As

anticipations adjusted, the short-run curve would move upward, ultimately
to the curve defined for an anticipated inflation rate of B. Concurrently un-
employment would move gradually over from F to G. [For a fuller discussion,
see (5).]
  This analysis is, of course, oversimplified. It supposes a single unanticipated
change, whereas, of course, there is a continuing stream of unanticipated
changes; it does not deal explicitly with lags, or with overshooting; or with the
process of formation of anticipations. But it does highlight the key points:
what matters is not inflation per se, but unanticipated inflation; there is no
stable trade-off between inflation and unemployment; there is a “natural rate


                                 M. Friedman                                   273

of unemployment” (U N ), which is consistent with the real forces --    and with
accurate perceptions; unemployment can be kept below that level only by an
accelerating inflation; or above it, only by accelerating deflation.
   The “natural rate of unemployment”, a term I introduced to parallel Knut
Wicksell’s “natural rate of interest”, is not a numerical constant but depends
on “real” as opposed to monetary factors - the effectiveness of the labor market,
the extent of competition or monopoly, the barriers or encouragements to
working in various occupations, and so on.
   For example, the natural rate has clearly been rising in the United States
for two major reasons. First, women, teenagers, and part-time workers have
been constituting a growing fraction of the labor force. These groups are more
mobile in employment than other workers, entering and leaving the labor
market, shifting more frequently between jobs. As a result, they tend t o
experience higher average rates of unemployment. Second, unemployment
insurance and other forms of assistance to unemployed persons have been
made available to more categories of workers, and have become more generous
in duration and amount. Workers who lose their jobs are under less pressure to
look for other work, will tend to wait longer in the hope, generally fulfilled,
of being recalled to their former employment, and can be more selective in the
alternatives they consider. Further, the availability of unemployment insurance
makes it more attractive to enter the labor force in the first place, and so may
itself have stimulated the growth that has occurred in the labor force as a
percentage of the population and also its changing composition.
   The determinants of the natural rate of unemployment deserve much fuller
analysis for both the United States and other countries. So also do the meaning
of the recorded unemployment figures and the relation between the recorded
figures and the natural rate. These issues are all of the utmost importance for
public policy. However, they are side issues for my present limited purpose.
   The connection between the state of employment and the level of efficiency
or productivity of an economy is another topic that is of fundamental im-
portance for public policy but is a side issue for my present purpose. There
is a tendency to take it for granted that a high level of recorded unemployment
is evidence of inefficient use of resources and conversely. This view is seriousIy
in error. A low level of unemployment may be a sign of a forced-draft economy
that is using its resources inefficiently and is inducing workers to sacrifice
leisure for goods that they value less highly than the leisure under the mistaken
belief that their real wages will be higher than they prove to be. Or a low
natural rate of unemployment may reflect institutional arrangements that
inhibit change. A highly static rigid economy may have a fixed place for every-
one whereas a dynamic, highly progressive economy, which offers ever-
changing opportunities and fosters flexibility, may have a high natural rate
of unemployment. To illustrate how the same rate may correspond to very
different conditions: both Japan and the United Kingdom had low average
rates of unemployment from, say, 1950 to 1970, but Japan experienced rapid
growth, the U.K., stagnation.
   The “natural-rate” or “accelerationist” or “expectations-adjusted Phillips


274                            Economic Sciences 1976

curve” hypothesis - as it has been variously designated - is by now widely
accepted by economists, though by no means universally. A few still cling to
the original Phillips curve; more recognize the difference between short-run
and long-run curves but regard even the long-run curve as negatively sloped,
though more steeply so than the short-run curves; some substitute a stable
relation between the acceleration of inflation and unemployment for a stable
relation between inflation and unemployment - aware of but not concerned
about the possibility that the same logic that drove them to a second derivative
will drive them to ever higher derivatives.
   Much current economic research is devoted to exploring various aspects of
this second stage - the dynamics of the process, the formation of expectations,
and the kind of systematic policy, if any, that can have a predictable effect
on real magnitudes. We can expect rapid progress on these issues, (Special
mention should be made of the work on “rational expectations”, especially
the seminal contributions of John Muth, Robert Lucas, and Thomas Sargent.)
[Gordon (9).]



4. STAGE 3: A POSITIVELY SLOPED PHILLIPS CURVE?
Although the second stage is far from having been fully explored, let alone
fully absorbed into the economic literature, the course of events is already
producing a move to a third stage. In recent years, higher inflation has often
been accompanied by higher not lower unemployment, especially for periods of
several years in length. A simple statistical Phillips curve for such periods
seems to be positively sloped, not vertical. The third stage is directed at ac-
commodating this apparent empirical phenomenon. To do so, I suspect that
it will have to include in the analysis the interdependence of economic ex-
perience and political developments. It will have to treat at least some political
phenomena not as independent variables - as exogenous variables in econ-
ometric jargon - but as themselves determined by economic events - as
endogenous variables [Gordon (8)]. T he second stage was greatly influenced
by two major developments in economic theory of the past few decades - one,
the analysis of imperfect information and of the cost of acquiring information,
pioneered by George Stigler; the other, the role of human capital in determining
the form of labor contracts, pioneered by Gary Becker. The third stage will,
I believe, be greatly influenced by a third major development - the application
of economic analysis to political behavior, a field in which pioneering work
has also been done by Stigler and Becker as well as by Kenneth Arrow, Duncan
Black, Anthony Downs, James Buchanan, Gordon Tullock, and others.
   The apparent positive relation between inflation and unemployment has
been a source of great concern to government policy makers. Let me quote
from a recent speech by Prime Minister Callaghan of Great Britain:
   “We used to think that you could just spend your way out of a recession and
increase employment by cutting taxes and boosting Government spending.
I tell you, in all candour, that that option no longer exists, and that insofar as
it ever did exist, it only worked by injecting bigger doses of inflation into the


                                       M. Friedman                                  275

economy followed by higher levels of unemployment as the next step. That is
the history of the past 20 years” (speech to Labour Party Conference, 28
September 1976).
  The same view is expressed in a Canadian government white paper:
“Continuing inflation, particularly in North America, has been accompanied
by an increase in measured unemployment rates” (“The Way Ahead: A
Framework for Discussion,” Government of Canada Working Paper, October
1976).
   These are remarkable statements, running as they do directly counter to
the policies adopted by almost every Western government throughout the
postwar period.

a. Some evidence
More systematic evidence for the past two decades is given in Table 1 and
Figures 3 and 4, which show the rates of inflation and unemployment in seven
industrialized countries over the past two decades. According to the five-
year averages in Table 1, the rate of inflation and the level of unemployment
moved in opposite directions-the expected simple Phillips curve outcome - in
five out of seven countries between the first two quinquennia (1956-60,
1961-65); in only four out of seven countries between the second and third
quinquennia (1961-65 and 1966-70); and in only one out of seven countries
between the final two quinquennia (1966-70 and 1970-75). And even the
one exception - Italy - is not a real exception. True, unemployment averaged
a shade lower from 1971 to 1975 than in the prior five years, despite a more
than tripling of the rate of inflation. However, since 1973, both inflation and
unemployment have risen sharply.
   The averages for all seven countries plotted in Figure 3 bring out even more

clearly the shift from a negatively sloped simple Phillips curve to a positively
sloped one. The two curves move in opposite directions between the first
two quinquennia; in the same direction thereafter.

five indicated calendar years. As a result, DP is dated one-half year prior to associated U.


   The annual data in Figure 4 tell a similar, though more confused, story.
In the early years, there is wide variation in the relation between prices and
unemployment, varying from essentially no relation, as in Italy, to a fairly
clear-cut year-to-year negative relation, as in the U.K. and the U.S. In recent
years, however, France, the U.S., the U.K., Germany and Japan all show a
clearly marked rise in both inflation and unemployment - though for Japan,
the rise in unemployment is much smaller relative to the rise in inflation than
in the other countries, reflecting the different meaning of unemployment in
the different institutional environment of Japan. Only Sweden and Italy fail
to conform to the general pattern.
   Of course, these data are at most suggestive. We do not really have seven
independent bodies of data. Common international influences affect all coun-
tries so that multiplying the number of countries does not multiply propor-

tionately the amount of evidence. In particular, the oil crisis hit all seven
countries at the same time. Whatever effect the crisis had on the rate of in-
flation, it directly disrupted the productive process and tended to increase
unemployment. Any such increases can hardly be attributed to the accelera-
tion of inflation that accompanied them; at most the two could be regarded
as at least partly the common result of a third influence [Gordon (7)].
   Both the quinquennial and annual data show that the oil crisis cannot
wholly explain the phenomenon described so graphically by Mr. Callaghan
Already before the quadrupling of oil prices in 1973, most countries show a
clearly marked association of rising inflation and rising unemployment. But
this too may reflect independent forces rather than the influence of inflation
on unemployment. For example, the same forces that have been raising the
natural rate of unemployment in the U.S. may have been operating in other
countries and may account for their rising trend of unemployment, independ-
ently of the consequences of inflation.
   Despite these qualifications, the data strongly suggest that, at least in some
countries, of which Britain, Canada, and Italy may be the best examples,
rising inflation and rising unemployment have been mutually reinforcing,

rather than the separate effects of separate causes. The data are not inconsistent
with the stronger statement that, in all industrialized countries, higher rates
of inflation have some effects that, at least for a time, make for higher unem-
ployment. The rest of this paper is devoted to a preliminary exploration of
what some of these effects may be.

b. A tentative hypothesis
I conjecture that a modest elaboration of the natural-rate hypothesis is all
that is required to account for a positive relation between inflation and
unemployment, though of course such a positive relation may also occur for
other reasons. Just as the natural-rate hypothesis explains a negatively sloped
Phillips curve over short periods as a temporary phenomenon that will dis-
appear as economic agents adjust their expectations to reality, so a positively
sloped Phillips curve over somewhat longer periods may occur as a transitional
phenomenon that will disappear as economic agents adjust not only their
expectations but their institutional and political arrangements to a new
reality. When this is achieved, I believe that - as the natural - rate hypothesis
suggests - the rate of unemployment will be largely independent of the average
rate of inflation, though the efficiency of utilization of resources may not be.
High inflation need not mean either abnormally high or abnormally low
unemployment. However, the institutional and political arrangements that
accompany it, either as relics of earlier history or as products of the inflation
itself, are likely to prove antithetical to the most productive use of employed
resources - a special case of the distinction between the state of employment
and the productivity of an economy referred to earlier.
   Experience in many Latin American countries that have adjusted to
chronically high inflation rates - experience that has been analyzed most
perceptively by some of my colleagues, particularly Arnold Harberger and
Larry Sjaastad [(12), (25)] - is consistent, I believe, with this view.
   In the version of the natural-rate hypothesis summarized in Figure 2, the
vertical curve is for alternative rates of fully anticipated inflation. Whatever
that rate - be it negative, zero or positive - it can be built into every decision
if it is fully anticipated. At an anticipated 20 percent per year inflation, for
example, long-term wage contracts would provide for a wage in each year that
would rise relative to the zero-inflation wage by just 20 percent per year;
long-term loans would bear an interest rate 20 percentage points higher than
the zero-inflation rate, or a principal that would be raised by 20 percent a year;
and so on - in short, the equivalent of a full indexing of all contracts. The
high rate of inflation would have some real effects, by altering desired cash
balances, for example, but it need not alter the efficiency of labor markets, or
the length or terms of labor contracts, and hence, it need not change the natural
rate of unemployment.
   This analysis implicitly supposes, first, that inflation is steady or at least
no more variable at a high rate than at a low - otherwise, it is unlikely that
inflation would be as fully anticipated at high as at low rates of inflation;
second, that the inflation is, or can be, open, with all prices free to adjust to

the higher rate, so that relative price adjustments are the same with a 20
percent inflation as with a zero inflation; third, really a variant of the second
point, that there are no obstacles to indexing of contracts.
   Ultimately, if inflation at an average rate of 20 percent per year were to
prevail for many decades, these requirements could come fairly close to being
met, which is why I am inclined to retain the long-long-run vertical Phillips
curve. But when a country initially moves to higher rates of inflation, these
requirements will be systematically departed from. And such a transitional
period may well extend over decades.
   Consider, in particular, the U.S. and the U.K. For two centuries before
World War II for the U.K., and a century and a half for the U.S., prices
varied about a roughly constant level, showing substantial increases in time of
war, then postwar declines to roughly prewar levels. The concept of a “normal”
price level was deeply imbedded in the financial and other institutions of the
two countries and in the habits and attitudes of their citizens.
   In the immediate post-World War II period, prior experience was widely
expected to recur. The fact was postwar inflation superimposed on wartime
inflation; yet the expectation in both the U.S. and the U.K. was deflation.
It took a long time for the fear of postwar deflation to dissipate - if it still
has-and still longer before expectations started to adjust to the fundamental
change in the monetary system. That adjustment is still far from complete
[Klein (16)].
   Indeed, we do not know what a complete adjustment will consist of. We
cannot know now whether the industrialized countries will return to the pre-
World War II pattern of a long-term stable price level, or will move toward
the Latin American pattern of chronically high inflation rates - with every
now and then an acute outbreak of super- or hyperinflation, as occurred
recently in Chile and Argentina [Harberger (11)] -or will undergo more
radical economic and political change leading to a still different resolution of
the present ambiguous situation.
   This uncertainty - or more precisely, the circumstances producing this
uncertainty - leads to systematic departures from the conditions required for
a vertical Phillips curve.
   The most fundamental departure is that a high inflation rate is not likely to
be steady during the transition decades. Rather, the higher the rate, the more
variable it is likely to be. That has been empirically true of differences among
countries in the past several decades [Jaffe and Kleiman (14); Logue and Wil-
lett (17)]. It is also highly plausible on theoretical grounds - both about
actual inflation and, even more clearly, the anticipations of economic agents
with respect to inflation. Governments have not produced high inflation as a
deliberate announced policy but as a consequence of other policies - in
particular, policies of full employment and welfare state policies raising
government spending. They all proclaim their adherence to the goal of stable
prices. They do so in response to their constituents, who may welcome many
of the side effects of inflation, but are still wedded to the concept of stable money.
A burst of inflation produces strong pressure to counter it. Policy goes from one

 direction to the other, encouraging wide variation in the actual and anti-
cipated rate of inflation. And, of course, in such an environment, no one has
single-valued anticipations. Everyone recognizes that there is great uncertainty
about what actual inflation will turn out to be over any specific future interval
[Jaffe and Kleiman (14); Meiselman (20)].
   The tendency for inflation that is high on the average to be highly variable
is reinforced by the effect of inflation on the political cohesiveness of a country
in which institutional arrangements and financial contracts have been adjusted
to a long-term “normal” price level. Some groups gain (e.g., home owners);
others lose (e.g., owners of savings accounts and fixed interest securities),
“Prudent” behavior becomes in fact reckless, and “reckless” behavior in fact
prudent. The society is polarized; one group is set against another. Political
unrest increases. The capacity of any government to govern is reduced at the
same time that the pressure for strong action grows.
   An increased variability of actual or anticipated inflation may raise the
natural rate of unemployment in two rather different ways.
   First, increased volatility shortens the optimum length of unindexed com-
mitments and renders indexing more advantageous [Gray (10)]. But it takes
time for actual practice to adjust. In the meantime, prior arrangements intro-
duce rigidities that reduce the effectiveness of markets. An additional element
of uncertainty is, as it were, added to every market arrangement. In addition,
indexing is, even at best, an imperfect substitute for stability of the inflation
rate. Price indexes are imperfect; they are available only with a lag, and
generally are applied to contract terms only with a further lag.
   These developments clearly lower economic efficiency. It is less clear what
their effect is on recorded unemployment. High average inventories of all
kinds is one way to meet increased rigidity and uncertainty. But that may
mean labor-hoarding by enterprises and low unemployment or a larger force
of workers between jobs and so high unemployment. Shorter commitments may
mean more rapid adjustment of employment to changed conditions and so low
unemployment, or the delay in adjusting the length of commitments may lead
to less satisfactory adjustment and so high unemployment. Clearly, much
additional research is necessary in this area to clarify the relative importance
of the various effects. About all one can say now is that the slow adjustment of
commitments and the imperfections of indexing may contribute to the recorded
increase in unemployment.
   A second related effect of increased volatility of inflation is to render market
prices a less efficient system for coordinating economic activity. A fundamental
function of a price system, as Hayek (13) emphasized so brilliantly, is to trans-
mit compactly, efficiently, and at low cost the information that economic
agents need in order to decide what to produce and how to produce it, or how
to employ owned resources. The relevant information is about relative prices -
of one product relative to another, of the services of one factor of production
relative to another, of products relative to factor services, of prices now
relative to prices in the future. But the information in practice is transmitted
in the form of absolute prices - prices in dollars or pounds or kronor. If the

 price level is on the average stable or changing at a steady rate, it is relatively
 easy to extract the signal about relative prices from the observed absolute
 prices. The more volatile the rate of general inflation, the harder it becomes to
 extract the signal about relative prices from the absolute prices: the broadcast
 about relative prices is as it were being jammed by the noise coming from the
inflation broadcast [Lucas (18), (19); Harberger (11)]. At the extreme, the
 system of absolute prices becomes nearly useless, and economic agents resort
 either to an alternative currency, or to barter, with disastrous effects on
 productivity.
    Again, the effect on economic efficiency is clear, on unemployment less so.
 But, again, it seems plausible that the average level of unemployment would
 be raised by the increased amount of noise in market signals, at least during the
period when institutional arrangements are not yet adapted to the new situation.
    These effects of increased volatility of inflation would occur even if prices
were legally free to adjust - if, in that sense, the inflation were open. In practice,
the distorting effects of uncertainty, rigidity of voluntary long-term contracts,
and the contamination of price signals will almost certainly be reinforced by
legal restrictions on price change. In the modern world, governments are
themselves producers of services sold on the market: from postal services to a
wide range of other items. Other prices are regulated by government, and
require government approval for change: from air fares to taxicab fares to
charges for electricity. In these cases, governments cannot avoid being involved
in the price-fixing process, In addition, the social and political forces unleashed
by volatile inflation rates will lead governments to try to repress inflation in
still other areas: by explicit price and wage control, or by pressuring private
businesses or unions “voluntarily” to exercise “restraint”, or by speculating
in foreign exchange in order to alter the exchange rate.
   The details will vary from time to time and from country to country, but
the general result is the same: reduction in the capacity of the price system
to guide economic activity; distortions in relative prices because of the intro-
duction of greater friction, as it were, in all markets; and, very likely, a higher
recorded rate of unemployment [(5)].
   The forces I have just described may render the political and economic
system dynamically unstable and produce hyperinflation and radical political
change - as in many defeated countries after World War I, or in Chile and
Argentina more recently. At the other extreme, before any such catastrophe
occurs, policies may be adopted that will achieve a relatively low and stable
rate of inflation and lead to the dismantling of many of the interferences with
the price system. That would re-establish the preconditions for the straight-
forward natural-rate hypothesis and enable that hypothesis to be used to pre-
dict the course of the transition.
   An intermediate possibility is that the system will reach stability at a fairly
constant though high average rate of inflation. In that case, unemployment
should also settle down to a fairly constant level decidedly lower than during
the transition. As the preceding discussion emphasizes, increasing volatility
and increasing government intervention with the price system are the major


282                            Economic Sciences 1976


factors that seem likely to raise unemployment, not high volatility or a high
level of intervention.
   Ways of coping with both volatility and intervention will develop: through
indexing and similar arrangements for coping with volatility of inflation;
through the development of indirect ways of altering prices and wages for
avoiding government controls.
   Under these circumstances, the long-run Phillips curve would again be
vertical, and we would be back at the natural-rate hypothesis, though perhaps
for a different range of inflation rates than that for which it was first suggested.
   Because the phenomenon to be explained is the coexistence of high inflation
and high unemployment, I have stressed the effect of institutional changes pro-
duced by a transition from a monetary system in which there was a “normal”
price level to a monetary system consistent with long periods of high, and
possibly highly variable, inflation. It should be noted that once these institu-
tional changes were made, and economic agents had adjusted their practices
and anticipations to them, a reversal to the earlier monetary framework or even
the adoption in the new monetary framework of a successful policy of low
inflation would in its turn require new adjustments, and these might have
many of the same adverse transitional effects on the level of employment.
There would appear to be an intermediate-run negatively sloped Phillips
curve instead of the positively sloped one I have tried to rationalize.



5. CONCLUSION
One consequence of the Keynesian revolution of the 1930’s was the acceptance
of a rigid absolute wage level, and a nearly rigid absolute price level, as a
starting point for analyzing short-term economic change. It came to be taken
for granted that these were essentially institutional data and were so regarded
by economic agents, so that changes in aggregate nominal demand would be
reflected almost entirely in output and hardly at all in prices. The age-old
confusion between absolute prices and relative prices gained a new lease on
life.
    In this intellectual atmosphere it was understandable that economists
would analyze the relation between unemployment and nominal rather than
real wages and would implicitly regard changes in anticipated nominal wages as
equal to changes in anticipated real wages. Moreover, the empirical evidence
that initially suggested a stable relation between the level of unemployment
and the rate of change of nominal wages was drawn from a period when,
despite sharp short-period fluctuations in prices, there was a relatively stable
long-run price level and when the expectation of continued stability was
widely shared. Hence these data flashed no warning signals about the special
character of the assumptions.
   The hypothesis that there is a stable relation between the level of unem-
ployment and the rate of inflation was adopted by the economics profession
with alacrity. It filled a gap in Keynes’ theoretical structure. It seemed to be
the “one equation” that Keynes himself had said “we are . . . short” (15). In


                                 M. Friedman                                    283

addition, it seemed to provide a reliable tool for economic policy, enabling the
economist to inform the policy maker about the alternatives available to him.
   As in any science, so long as experience seemed to be consistent with the
reigning hypothesis, it continued to be accepted, although as always, a few
dissenters questioned its validity.
   But as the ‘50’s turned into the ‘60’s, and the ‘60’s into the ‘70’s, it became
increasingly difficult to accept the hypothesis in its simple form. It seemed to
take larger and larger doses of inflation to keep down the level of unemploy-
ment. Stagflation reared its ugly head.
   Many attempts were made to patch up the hypothesis by allowing for special
factors such as the strength of trade unions. But experience stubbornly refused
to conform to the patched up version.
   A more radical revision was required. It took the form of stressing the
importance of surprises - of differences between actual and anticipated magni-
tudes. It restored the primacy of the distinction between “real” and “nominal”
magnitudes. There is a “natural rate of unemployment” at any time deter-
mined by real factors. This natural rate will tend to be attained when expecta-
tions are on the average realized. The same real situation is consistent with any
absolute level of prices or of price change, provided allowance is made for the
effect of price change on the real cost of holding money balances. In this re-
spect, money is neutral. On the other hand, unanticipated changes in aggregate
nominal demand and in inflation will cause systematic errors of perception on
the part of employers and employees alike that will initially lead unemploy-
ment to deviate in the opposite direction from its natural rate. In this respect,
money is not neutral. However, such deviations are transitory, though it may
take a long chronological time before they are reversed and finally eliminated
as anticipations adjust.
   The natural-rate hypothesis contains the original Phillips curve hypothesis
as a special case and rationalizes a far broader range of experience, in particular
the phenomenon of stagflation. It has by now been widely though not univer-
sally accepted.
   However, the natural-rate hypothesis in its present form has not proved
rich enough to explain a more recent development - a move from stagflation
to slumpflation. In recent years, higher inflation has often been accompanied
by higher unemployment - not lower unemployment, as the simple Phillips
curve would suggest, nor the same unemployment, as the natural-rate hypo-
thesis would suggest.
   This recent association of higher inflation with higher unemployment may
reflect the common impact of such events as the oil crisis, or independent forces
that have imparted a common upward trend to inflation and unemployment.
   However, a major factor in some countries and a contributing factor in
others may be that they are in a transitional period - this time to be measured
by quinquennia or decades not years. The public has not adapted its attitudes
or its institutions to a new monetary environment. Inflation tends not only to
be higher but also increasingly volatile and to be accompanied by widening
government intervention into the setting of prices. The growing volatility of

inflation and the growing departure of relative prices from the values that
market forces alone would set combine to render the economic system less
efficient, to introduce frictions in all markets, and, very likely, to raise the
recorded rate of unemployment.
   On this analysis, the present situation cannot last. It will either degenerate
into hyperinflation and radical change; or institutions will adjust to a situation
of chronic inflation; or governments will adopt policies that will produce a
low rate of inflation and less government intervention into the fixing of prices.
   I have told a perfectly standard story of how scientific theories are revised.
Yet it is a story that has far-reaching importance.
   Government policy about inflation and unemployment has been at the center
of political controversy. Ideological war has raged over these matters. Yet the
drastic change that has occurred in economic theory has not been a result of
ideological warfare. It has not resulted from divergent political beliefs or aims
It has responded almost entirely to the force of events: brute experience
proved far more potent than the strongest of political or ideological preferences.
   The importance for humanity of a correct understanding of positive economic
science is vividly brought out by a statement made nearly two hundred years
ago by Pierre S. du Pont, a Deputy from Nemours to the French National
Assembly, speaking, appropriately enough, on a proposal to issue additional
assignats - the fiat money of the French Revolution:
   “Gentlemen, it is a disagreeable custom to which one is too easily led by
the harshness of the discussions, to assume evil intentions. It is necessary to be
gracious as to intentions; one should believe them good, and apparently they
are; but we do not have to be gracious at all to inconsistent logic or to absurd
reasoning. Bad logicians have committed more involuntary crimes than bad
men have done intentionally” (25 September 1790).
