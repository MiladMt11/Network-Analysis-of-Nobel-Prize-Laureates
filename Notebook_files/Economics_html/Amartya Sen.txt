“A camel,” it has been said, “is a horse designed by a committee.” This might sound  like  a 
telling  example  of  the  terrible  deficiencies  of committee  deci- sions, but it is really much 
 too mild an indictment. A camel may not have the speed of a horse, but it is a very useful and 
harmonious animal — well coordi- nated to travel long distances without food and water. A committee 
 that tries to  reflect  the  diverse  wishes  of  its  different  members  in  designing  a  horse 
could  very  easily  end  up  with   something   far  less  congruous:   perhaps  a centaur  of  
Greek  mythology,  half a horse  and  half something  else — a mer- curial creation  combining 
savagery with confusion.
The  difficulty  that  a  small  committee  experiences  may  be  only  greater when  it comes  to 
decisions of a sizable society,  reflecting  the choices  “of the people, by the people, for the 
people.” That, broadly speaking, is the subject of “social choice,” and it includes within its 
capacious frame various problems with the common feature of relating social judgments and group 
decisions to the  views  and  interests  of  the  individuals  who  make  up  the  society  or  the 
group.  If there  is a central question  that can  be seen  as the  motivating  issue that inspires 
social choice  theory,  it is this: how can it be possible  to arrive at cogent  aggregative  
judgments  about  the  society  (for  example,  about  “social welfare,” or “the public  interest,” 
or “aggregate  poverty”) , given  the diversity of preferences, concerns, and predicaments of the 
different individuals ithin the society?  How can we find any rational  basis for making  such  
aggregative judgements as “the society prefers this to that,” or “the society should choose this 
over that,” or “this is socially right”? Is reasonable social choice at all pos- sible, especially 
since, as Horace  noted a long time ago, there may be “as ma- ny preferences as there are people”?

I. SOCIAL CHOICE THEORY
In   this  lecture,   I  shall   try  to  discuss  some  challenges   and  foundational problems 
faced by social choice theory as a discipline.' The immediate  occa- sion for this lecture is, of 
course, an award, and I am aware that I am expected to  discuss,  in  one form  or another,  my  
own  work  associated  with  this  event (however immodest that attempt might otherwise  have  
been) . This I will  try to do,  but it is,  I  believe,  also  a plausible  occasion  to address  
some  general questions  about  social  choice  as  a  discipline  —  its  content,  relevance,  
and reach — and I intend to seize this opportunity. The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences referred  
to “welfare  economics” as the general  field  of my work for which  the  award  was given,  and  
separated  out  three  particular  areas:  social choice, distribution,  and poverty.  While I  
have indeed  been  occupied,  in va- rious ways, with these different subjects, it is social choice 
theory, pioneering- ly formulated  in  its modern  form  by Arrow  (1951),'  that provides  a 
general approach  to the evaluation  of, and choice over, alternative social possibilities 
(including inter alia the assessment of social welfare, inequality, and poverty). This I take to be 
reason  enough for primarily concentrating  on social choice theory in this Nobel lecture.
Social choice theory is a very broad discipline, covering a variety of distinct questions, and it 
may be useful  to mention  a few of  the problems  as illustra- tions of its subject matter (on 
many of which I have been privileged  to work). When  would  maJorify  rule yield  unambiguous  and 
consistent  decisions?  How can we judge how well a society  as a whole is doing in the light of 
the disparate interests  of  its  different  members?  How  do  we  measure  aggregate  poverty  in 
view  of  the  varying  predicaments  and  miseries  of  the  diverse  people  that make up the 
society? How can we accommodate  rights  and  liberties of  persons while giving adequate  
recognition  to their preferences?  How do we appraise social valuations of public goods such as 
the natural environment,  or epidemiolo- gical  securifl ?  Also,  some  investigations,  while  
not  directly  a  part  of  social choice  theory,  have  been  helped  by  the  understanding  
generated  by  the study of group decisions  (such as the causation and prevention of  famines and 
hunger, or the forms and consequences of gender inequalifl,  or the demands of tndividual freedom 
seen as a “social commitment”). The reach and relevance of social choice theory can be very 
extensive indeed.

II. ORIGINS OF SOCIAL CHOICE THEORYAND CONSTRUCTIVE  PESSIMISM
How did the subject of social choice theory originate?  The challenges  of so- cial decisions 
involving divergent interests and concerns have been explored

' This is, obviously,  not a survey of social choice  theory and there is no attempt here to scan  
the relevant  literature.  Overviews  can  be found  in Alan  M. Feldman  (1980) , Prasanta  K. 
Pattanaik and Maurice  Salles  (1983) , Kotaro Suzumura  (1983) , Peter J.  Hammond  (1985) , Jon 
Elster and Aanund  Hylland  (1986) ,  Sen  ( 1986a) ,  David  Starrett  (1988),  Dennis  C.  
Mueller  (1989) ,  and more extensively  in Kenneth J.  Arrow et al.  (1997) .

for a long  time. For example, Aristotle  in ancient Greece and Kautilya in an- cient India, both  
of whom lived in  the fourth century B.C., explored various constructive  possibilities  in social  
choice  in  their  books  respectively  entitled Politics  and Economics.’
However,  social  choice  theory as a systematic  discipline  first came  into  its own around the 
time of the French Revolution. The subject was pioneered  by French  mathematicians  in  the  late  
eighteenth  century,  such  as J   C.  Borda
(1781)  and Marquis de Condorcet  (1785) , who addressed  these problems  in
rather  mathematical  terms and who  initiated  the formal  discipline  of social choice in  terms 
of voting and related procedures. The intellectual climate of the  period  was  much  influenced  
by  European  Enlightenment,  with  its  in- terest  in  reasoned  construction  of  social  order. 
 Indeed,  some  of  the  early social  choice  theorists,  most  notably  Condorcet,  were  also  
among  the  intel- lectual leaders of the French Revolution.
The French  Revolution,  however,  did not usher  in a peaceful  social order in  France.  Despite  
its  momentous  achievements  in  changing  the  political agenda  across  the  whole  world,  in  
France  itself it  not  only  produced  much strife  and  bloodshed,  it also  led  to what  is  
often  called,  not  inaccurately,  a “reign  of  terror.” Indeed,  many of  the  theorists  of  
social  coordination,  who had contributed to the ideas behind the Revolution, perished in the 
flames of the  discord  that  the  Revolution  itself  unleashed  (this  included  Condorcet who 
took his own life when  it became quite likely that others would do it for him) . Problems  of 
social  choice, which  were  being addressed  at the  level  of theory  and  analysis,  did  not  
wait,  in  this  case,  for  a  peacefully  intellectual resolution.
The  motivation  that  moved  the  early social  choice  theorists  included  the avoidance  of  
both  instability  and  arbitrariness  in  arrangements  for  social choice. The ambitions of their 
work focused on  the development of a frame- work for rational  and democratic  decisions for a 
group,  paying  adequate  at- tention to the preferences and interests of all its members. However, 
even the theoretical   investigations  typically  yielded  rather  pessimistic   results.  They 
noted, for example, that majority rule can be thoroughly inconsistent, with  A defeating  B  by  a  
majority,  B  defeating  C  also  by  a  majority,  and  C  in  turn defeating  A,  by a majority 
as well.’
A  good  deal  of  exploratory  work  (often,  again,  with  pessimistic  results) continued  in  
Europe  through  the  nineteenth  century.  Indeed,  some  very creative  people worked in this 
area and wrestled with the difficulties  of social


“Arthashastra,” the  Sanskrit  word  (the  title  of Kautilya's  book),  is  best  translated  
literally  as “Economics,” even  though  he devoted  much space  to investigating  the demands of 
statecraft in a conflictual  society.  English  translations  of Aristotle's  Polttics  and  
Kautilya's  Arthashastra can  be found respectively in E. Barker (1958) and L. N. Rangarajan  
(1987) . On the interesting medieval European  writings on these issues see, for example,  Ian 
McLean  (1990) .
See  Condorcet  (1785) .  There  are  many  commentaries  on  these  analyses,  including  Arrow 
(1951), Duncan Black (1958) , William V. Gehrlein  (1983) , H. Peyton Young (1988) , and McLean 
(1990). On  the potential  ubiquity  of inconsistency  in  majority voting, see  Richard  D. 
McKelvey (1979) and Norman J.  Schofield  (1983) .

choice, including  Lewis Carroll,  the author of  Alice in Wonderland  (under his real name, C. L. 
Dodgson,  1874, 1884).
When  the subject  of social  choice was revived  in  the twentieth  century  by Arrow  (1951) , he 
too was very concerned with  the difficulties  of group deci- sions and the inconsistencies to 
which they may lead. While Arrow put the dis- cipline of social choice in a structured — and 
axiomatic — framework  (thereby leading to the birth of social choice theory in its modern form), 
he deepened the preexisting  gloom  by establishing  an astonishing — and apparently pessi- mistic 
— result of ubiquitous reach.
Arrow's (1950, 1951, 1963)  “impossibility theorem” (formally, the “General Possibility  Theorem”)  
is a result of  breathtaking  elegance  and power, which showed  that even some very mild 
conditions of reasonableness could not  be simultaneously satisfied by any social choice procedure, 
within a very wide fa- mily.  Only  a  dictatorship  would  avoid  inconsistencies,  but  that  of  
course would involve:  (1)  in politics, an extreme sacrifice  of participatory  decisions; and  
(2)  in welfare  economics,  a gross  inability  to  be sensitive  to the  hetero- geneous 
interests of a diverse population. Two centuries after the flowering of the ambitions of social 
rationality, in Enlightenment  thinking and in the writ- ings of  the theorists of the French 
Revolution,  the subject seemed  to be ines- capably doomed. Social appraisals, welfare economic 
calculations,  and evalu- ative   statistics   would   have   to   be,   it  seemed,   inevitably   
arbitrary   or  un- remediably despotic.
Arrow's  “impossibility  theorem”  aroused  immediate  and  intense  interest (and  generated  a  
massive  literature  in  response,  including  many  other  im- possibility  results) .’ It also  
led to the diagnosis of  a deep vulnerability  in  the subject that overshadowed Arrow's immensely 
important constructive program of developing a systematic  social choice  theory that could 
actually work.

III. WELFARE ECONOMICS  AND OBITUARY NOTICES
Social choice difficulties apply to welfare economics with a vengeance. By the mid-1960s,  William  
Baumol   (1965)  judiciously  remarked  that  “statements about  the significance  of welfare  
economics”  had started  having  “an  ill-con- cealed  resemblance  to obituary  notices”  (p.  2). 
This was certainly  the  right reading  of  the  prevailing  views.  But,  as  Baumol  himself  
noted,  we  have  to

By varying the axiomatic structure, related impossibility results can also be obtained. Examples 
can  be  found  in  Arrow  (1950,  1951,  1952,  1963) , Julian  H.  Blau  (1957,  1972,  1979) ,

assess how sound these views were. We have, especially, to ask whether the pes- simism  associated  
with  Arrovian  structures  in  social  choice  theory  must  be seen  to be devastating for 
welfare economics as a discipline.
As it happens, traditional welfare economics, which had been developed  by utilitarian  economists  
(such  as Francis T. Edgeworth,  1881; Alfred  Marshall, 1890; Arthur C. Pigou, 1920) , had taken a 
very different track from the vote- oriented  social  choice  theory.  It took  inspiration  not 
from  Borda  (1781)  or Condorcet  (1785),  but  from  their  contemporary Jeremy Bentham  (1789).
Bentham  had  pioneered  the  use  of  utilitarian  calculus  to obtain judgments
about the social interest by aggregating  the personal  interests of the different
individuals  in the form of their respective utilities.
Bentham’s concern — and that of utilitarianism in general — was with the fo- tal utiliq of a 
community. This was irrespective of the distribution  of that total, and  in  this  there  is  an  
informational  limitation  of  considerable  ethical  and political importance. For example, a 
person who is unlucky enough  to have a uniformly  lower  capability  to generate  enjoyment  and 
utility out of income (say,  because  of  a  handicap)  would  also  be  given,  in  the  
utilitarian  ideal world, a lower share of a given total. This is a consequence of the single-mind- 
ed  pursuit  of  maximizing  the  sum-total  of  utilities  (on  the  peculiar  conse-
quences  of  this  unifocal  priority,  see  Sen,  1970a,  1973a; J   hn  Rawls,  1971; Claude 
d'Aspremont  and Louis Gevers,  1977). However,  the utilitarian  inter- est in  taking  
comparative  note of the gains and  losses  of  different  people  is
not in itself a negligible  concern. And this concern  makes utilitarian  welfare economics  deeply 
interested  in using a class of  information — in  the form of comparison   of  utility  gains  and 
 losses  of  different  persons  —  with  which Condorcet and Borda had not been directly involved.
Utilitarianism  has  been  very  influential  in  shaping  welfare  economics, which was dominated 
for a long time by an almost unquestioning  adherence to  utilitarian  calculus.  But  by  the  
1930s  utilitarian  welfare  economics  came under  severe  fire.  It  would  have  been  quite  
natural  to  question   (as  Rawls [1971]  would  masterfully  do in formulating  his theory 
ofjustice)  the utilita- rian  neglect of distributional issues and its concentration  only on 
utility sum- totals in a distribution-blind way.  But that was not the direction  in which  the 
antiutilitarian critiques went  in  the  1930s  and  in  the  decades  that followed. Rather,  
economists  came to be persuaded  by arguments  presented by Lionel Robbins and others (deeply 
influenced by “logical positivist” philosophy)  that interpersonal  comparisons of utility had no 
scientific  basis: “Every mind is in- scrutable  to  every  other  mind  and  no  common  
denominator  of  feelings  is possible”  (Robbins,  1938 p. 636). Thus,  the epistemic  foundations 
 of utilita- rian welfare economics were seen as incurably defective.
There  followed  attempts  to do welfare  economics  on  the  basis  of  the  dif- ferent persons' 
respective orderings of social states, without any interpersonal comparisons of utility gains and 
losses  (nor, of course, any comparison  of the total utilities of different persons, which are 
neglected  by utilitarians as well) . While utilitarianism and utilitarian welfare economics are 
quite indifferent  to the  distribution  of  utilities  between  different  persons  
(concentrating, as  they

do, only on the  sum-total of  utilities) , the new regime without any interperso- nal  comparisons 
 in  any  form,  further  reduced  the  informational  base  on which  social  choice  could  draw. 
 The  already-limited  informational  base  of Benthamite  calculus  was  made  to  shrink  even  
further  to  that of  Borda  and Condorcet,  since the use of different persons’  utility rankings 
without any in- terpersonal comparison  is analytically quite similar  to the use of voting infor- 
mation  in making social choice.
Faced  with   this  informational   restriction,  utilitarian  welfare  economics gave  way,  from  
the  1940s  onwards,  to  a so-called  “new  welfare  economics,” which  used  only one  basic  
criterion  of social  improvement,  viz,  the  “Pareto comparison.” This criterion only asserts 
that an alternative situation would be definitely better if the change would increase  the utility 
of everyone.‘ A good deal of subsequent welfare economics restricts attention  to “Pareto 
efficiency” only  (that  is,  only  to  making  sure  that  no further  Pareto  improvements  are 
possible) .  This  criterion   takes  no  interest  whatever  in  distributional  issues, which  
cannot  be addressed without  considering  conflicts  of  interest  and  of preferences.
Some  further  criterion  is  clearly  needed  for  making  social  welfare  judg- ments  with  a  
greater  reach,  and  this  was  insightfully  explored   by  Abram Bergson  (1938)  and Paul A. 
Samuelson  (1947). This demand  led directly  to Arrow's  (1950, 1951)  pioneering formulation  of 
social choice theory, relating social preference  (or decisions)  to the set of individual  
preferences,  and this relation  is called  a “social welfare  function.” Arrow  ( 1951,  1963)  
went on  to consider a set of very mild-looking conditions, including:  (1)  Pareto efficien- cy,  
(2)  nondictatorship,  (3)  independence   (demanding  that  social  choice over any set of 
alternatives  must depend on preferences  only over those alter- natives) , and (4)  unrestricted 
domain  (requiring that social preference  must be  a  complete  ordering,  with  full  
transitivity,  and  that  this  must  work  for every conceivable  set of individual preferences) .
Arrow's  impossibility  theorem demonstrated  that it is impossible  to satisfy these  conditions  
simultaneously.’ In  order  to  avoid  this  impossibility  result, different ways of  modifying 
Arrow's requirements were tried out in the litera- ture that followed,  but other difficulties 
continued to emerge.’ The force and

" Or, at least,  if it enhanced  the  utility of at least one  person  and did  not  harm  the  
interest  of anyone.
’ There is also the structural assumption  that there are at least two distinct individuals  (but 
not in- finitely  many)  and  at  least  three  distinct  social  states  (not  perhaps  the  most  
unrealistic  of a+ sumptions  that economists have ever made) . The axioms referred to here are  
those in  the later version  of Arrow's  theorem: Arrow  (1963) . Since  the presentation  here is 
informal  and permits some  technical  ambiguities,  those  concerned  with  exactness  are  
referred  to  the  formal  state- ments in Arrow ( 1963) , or in Sen  (1970a)  or Fishburn  (1973)  
or Kelly (1978) . Regarding  proof, there are various versions, including, of course, Arrow (1963) 
. In Sen  (1995a)  a very short — and elementary — proof is given.  See  also  Sen  (1970a,  1979b) 
,  Blau  (1972) , Robert  Wilson  (1975) , Kelly  (1978) , Salvador Barbera (1980, 1983) , Bin more 
 ( 1994) , and John Geanakopolous  (1996) , among other variants.

widespread  presence  of impossibility  results generated  a consolidated  sense of pessimism, and 
this became a dominant  theme  in welfare economics and social choice theory in general. Is this 
reading justified?

IV. COMPLEMENTARITY OF FORMAL METHODS AND INFORMAL REASONING
Before I proceed further on substantive matters, it may be useful to comment briefly  on  the  
nature  of  the  reasoning  used  in  answering  this  and  related questions. Social choice theory 
is a subject in which formal and mathematical techniques  have been very extensively used. Those 
who are suspicious  of for- mal  (and in particular,  of mathematical)  modes of reasoning  are 
often skep- tical  of  the  usefulness  of  discussing  real-  world  problems  in  this  way.  
Their suspicion  is  understandable,  but  it  is  ultimately  misplaced.  The  exercise  of trying 
to get an integrated picture from diverse preferences or interests of dif- ferent people does 
involve many complex problems in which one could  be se- riously misled in the absence of formal 
scrutiny. Indeed, Arrow's (1950, 1951, 1963)  impossibility theorem — in many ways the “locus 
classicus” in this field — can  hardly  be anticipated  on  the  basis of common  sense or informal 
reason- ing. This applies also to extensions  of this result, for example  to the demon- stration  
that an exactly similar impossibility to Arrow's holds even without any imposed  demand  of  
internal  consistency  of  social  choice  (see  Sen,  1993a Theorem  3).  In  the  process  of  
discussing  some  substantive  issues  in  social choice  theory,  I shall  have  the opportunity  
to consider  various  results which too are not easily anticipated without formal reasoning. 
Informal insights, im- portant as they are, cannot replace  the formal investigations that are 
needed to examine  the congruity and cogency  of combinations  of values and of ap- parently 
plausible demands.
This  is  not  to  deny  that  the  task  of  widespread  public  communication  is crucial for the 
use of social choice  theory. It is centrally important for social choice theory to relate formal 
analysis to informal and transparent  examina- tion. I have to confess that in my own case, this 
combination  has, in fact, been something  of  an  obsession,  and some  of  the formal  ideas  I  
have  been  most concerned with  (such as an adequate framework for informational  broaden- ing, 
the use of partial comparability and of partial orderings, and the weaken- ing  of  consistency  
conditions  demanded  of  binary  relations  and  of  choice functions)  call  simultaneously for 
formal  investigation  and for informal  ex- plication and accessible scrutiny.’ Our deeply felt, 
real-world concerns have to be substantively integrated with the analytical use of formal and 
mathematical reasoning.




In fact, in my main monograph  in social choice theory — Collective Choice and  Social Welfare 
(Sen, 1970a), chapters with formal analysis  (the “starred” chapters)  alternate with chapters 
confined  to informal discussion  (the “unstarred” chapters).

V. PROXIMITY OF POSSIBILITY AND IMPOSSIBILITY
185

The  general  relationship  between  possibility  and  impossibility  results  also deserves  some  
attention,  in  order  to  understand  the  nature and  role  of im- possibility  theorems. When  a 
set of axioms regarding  social choice can all be simultaneously satisfied,  there  may be several 
possible procedures that work, among  which  we  have  to choose.  In  order  to choose  between  
the  different possibilities  through  the use of discriminating axioms, we  have  to introduce 
further axioms, until only one possible  procedure remains. This is something of  an  exercise  in  
brinkmanship.  We  have  to go  on  cutting  down  alternative possibilities, moving — implicitly — 
towards an impossibility, but then stop just before all possibilities  are eliminated,  to wit, 
when  one and only one option remains.
Thus, it should  be clear that a full axiomatic determination  of a particular method of making  
social choice must inescapably  lie next door to an impos- sibility — indeed just short of it. If 
it lies far from an impossibility  (with various positive  possibilities),  then  it cannot  give  
us  an  axiomatic  derivation  of  any specific  method  of  social  choice.  It  is,  therefore,  
to  be  expected  that  con- structive  paths  in  social  choice  theory,  derived  from  
axiomatic  reasoning, would  tend to be paved on one side  by impossibility  results  (opposite  to 
the side  of  multiple  possibilities).  No  conclusion  about  the  fragility  of  social choice 
theory (or its subject matter)  emerges from this proximity.
In  fact,  the  literature  that  has followed  Arrow's work  has shown  classes  of impossibility 
theorems and of positive possibility results, all of which lie quite close to each other.ⁱ’ The 
real issue is not, therefore,  the ubiquity of impossi- bility  (it will always lie close to the 
axiomatic  derivation  of any specific  social choice rule) , but the reach and reasonableness of 
the axioms to be used. We have  to  get  on  with  the  basic  task  of  obtaining  workable  rules 
 that  satisfy reasonable  requirements.

VI. MAJORITY DECISIONS AND COHERENCE
In  the discussion  so far, I have  made  no attempt  to confine attention  to par- ticular  
configurations of  individual  preferences,  ignoring  others.  Formally, this is required  by 
Arrow's condition  of  “unrestricted  domain,” which  insists that  the social choice  procedure  
must work for every conceivable  cluster  of

individual  preferences.  It  must,  however,  be  obvious  that,  for  any  decision procedure,  
some  preference  profiles  will  yield  inconsistencies  and  incohe- rence of social decisions 
while other profiles will not produce these results.
Arrow  (1951)  himself  had  initiated,  along  with  Black  (1948,  1958) ,  the search for 
adequate  restrictions  that would guarantee  consistent  majority de- cisions. The necessary and 
sufficient conditions for consistent  majority deci- sions can  indeed  be identified  (see Sen  
and  Pattanaik,  1969)     While  much less restrictive  than  the earlier conditions  that  had 
been  identified,  they are still quite demanding;  indeed it is shown that they would be easily 
violated in many actual situations.
The formal results on  necessary or sufficiency conditions of majority deci- sions  can  only give  
as much  hope — or generate  as much  disappointment — about  voting-based  social  choice  as  the 
 extent  of  social  cohesion  and  con- frontation   (in  the  actual  patterns  of  individual  
preferences)  would  allow. Choice  problems  for  the  society come  in  many  shapes  and  sizes, 
 and  there may be less comfort in these results for some types of  social choice problems than  
for others. When  distributional issues dominate  and when  people  seek to maximize  their own  
“shares” without concern  for others  (as, for example, in a “cake division” problem, with each 
preferring any division  that increases her own share, no matter what happens to the others), then 
majority rule will tend  to  be  thoroughly  inconsistent.  But when  there  is  a  matter  of  
national outrage  (for  example,  in  response  to  the  inability  of  a democratic  govern- ment  
to  prevent  a  famine),  the  electorate  may  be  reasonably  univocal  and thoroughly  
consistent."  Also,  when  people  cluster  in  parties,  with  complex agendas  and  dialogues,  
involving  give  and  take  as  well  as  some  general  at- titudes to values like equity or 
justice, the ubiquitous inconsistencies can yield ground to more congruous decisions."

So far as welfare  economics  is concerned,  majority rule and voting proce- dures are particularly 
prone to inconsistency, given  the centrality of distribu- tional  issues in welfare-economic 
problems.  However,  one of the basic que+ tions  to  ask  is whether  voting  rules  (to which  
social  choice  procedures  are effectively  restricted  in  the  Arrovian  framework)  provide  a  
reasonable  ap- proach  to social choice in the field of welfare economics. Are we in the right 
territory  in trying  to make  social welfare judgments  through variants of  vot- ing systems?

VII. INFORMATIONAL  BROADENING AND WELFARE ECONOMICS
Voting-based  procedures  are entirely natural for some kinds of social choice problems, such as 
elections, referendums, or committee decisions." They are, however,  altogether  unsuitable  for  
many  other  problems  of  social  choice.* When,  for  example,  we  want  to  get  some  kind  of 
 an  aggregative  index  of social  welfare,  we  cannot  rely  on  such  procedures  for  at  
least  two  distinct reasons.
First,  voting  requires  active  participation,  and  if  someone  decides  not  to exercise her 
voting right, her preference would find no direct representation in  social  decisions.  (Indeed,  
because  of  lower  participation, the  interests  of substantial groups — for example of African 
Americans  in the United States — find  inadequate  representation  in  national  politics.)  In  
contrast,  in  making reasonable social welfare judgments,  the interests of the less assertive 
cannot be simply ignored.
Second, even with  the active involvement  of every one in voting exercises, we cannot  but be 
short of important information  needed for welfare-econo- mic evaluation  (on this see Sen, 1970a, 
1975a). Through voting, each person can rank different alternatives.  But there is no direct way of 
 getting interper- sonal comparisons of different persons' well-being from voting data. We must go 
beyond the class of voting rules (explored by Borda and Condorcet as well as Arrow)  to be able to 
address distributional issues.
Arrow had ruled out the use of interpersonal comparisons since he had fol- lowed  the general  
consensus  that had emerged  in  the  1940’s that  (as Arrow


" There are, however, some serious problems arising from a possible lack of correspondence be- 
tween  votes  and  actual  preferences,  which  could  differ  because  of  strategic  voting  
aimed  at manipulation  of voting  results.  On  this  see  the  remarkable  impossibility  theorem 
 of Gibbard (1973)  and Satterthwaite  (1975) . There  is an  extensive  literature  on  
manipulation  and on  the challenges of implementation, on which see also Pattanaik (1973, 1978) ,

, Dutta and Pattanaik (1978), Peleg (1978, 1984) , Schmeidler and Sonnenschein  (1978) , Dasgupta 
rt al.  (1979) , Green
and  Laffont   (1979) ,  Laffont   (1979),  Dutta   (1980,  1997) ,  Pattanaik  and  Sengupta

Hurwicz  ct at. (1985), among other contributions. There is also a nonstrategic  impossibility in 
establishing an exact one-to-one  correspondence between:  (l)   preferring,  (2)  dispreferring, 
and  (3)  being  in- different, on  the one hand, and (l*) voting for, (2*) voting against, and 
(3*) abstaining, on  the other hand, no matter whether voting is costly, or enjoyable, or neither  
(see Sen, 1964) .
"  On this, see Sen  (1970a, 1977a) .

put it)  “interpersonal comparison  of utilities has no meaning”  (Arrow,  1951
p. 9).  The totality of  the axiom combination  used by Arrow had the effect of confining social 
choice procedures  to rules that are, broadly speaking, of the voting type    His impossibility 
result relates, therefore, to this class of rules.
To lay the foundations  of a constructive  social choice  theory, if we want to reject  the  
historical  consensus  against  the use of interpersonal  comparisons in social choice, we have to 
address two important — and difficult — questions. First, can we systematically incorporate  and 
use something as complex as in- terpersonal  comparisons  involving  many persons? Will  this be a 
territory  of disciplined  analysis,  rather  than  a riot of confusing  (and possibly confused) 
ideas? Second, how can the analytical results be integrated with practical use? On  what  kind  of 
information  can  we  sensibly  base  interpersonal  compari- sons? Will the relevant information  
be actually available, to be used?
The  first  is  primarily  a  question  of  analytical  system  building,  and  the second  that  
of  epistemology  as  well  as  practical  reason.  The  latter  issue requires  a  reexamination  
of the  informational  basis  of interpersonal  com- parisons, and I would presently argue that it 
calls for an inescapably qualified response.  But the first question  can  be addressed  more 
definitively  through constructive  analysis. Without going into  technicalities of the literature  
that has emerged, I would like to report that interpersonal comparisons of various types can be 
fully axiomatized and exactly incorporated in social choice pro- cedures  (through  the use of 
“invariance  conditions” in a generalized  frame-
work, formally constructed  as “social welfare functionals,” on which see Sen, 1970a,  1977c) pI7  
Indeed,  interpersonal  comparisons  need  not  even  be  con-
fined  to  “all-or-none”  dichotomies.  We  may  be  able  to  make  interpersonal comparisons  to 
some extent, but not in every comparison,  nor of every type, nor with tremendous exactness  (see 
Sen, 1970a, c).
We  may, for example,  have  no great  difficulty  in  accepting  that Emperor Nero's  utility gain 
from  the burning of Rome was smaller  than  the sum-total


"  It  should  be  explained  that  restricting  social  choice  procedures  to  voting  rules  is  
not  an assumption  that is invoked  by Arrow  (1951,  1963) ;  it is a part of the impossibility  
theorem  esta- blished by him. It is an analytical consequence of the set of apparently  reasonable 
axioms postu- lated for reasoned social choice. Interpersonal comparison  of utilities is, of 
course, explicitly ex- cluded, but the proof of Arrow's theorem shows that a set of other 
assumptions with considerable plausibility,    taken    together,   logically   entail   other   
features   of   voting    rules   as   well    (a remarkable analytical result on its own). The 
derived features include, in particular,  the demand- ing  requirement  that  no  effective  note  
be  taken  of the  nature  of the  social  states:  only  of the votes  that are  respectively  
cast in  favor  of — and against — them  (a property  that is often  called “neutrality” — a 
somewhat flattering  name for what is after all only an informational  restriction). While  the 
eschewal  of interpersonal  comparisons  of utilities  eliminates  the possibility  of taking note 
of inequality of utilities (and of differences in gains and losses of utilities),  the entailed 
com- ponent  of “neutrality”  prevents  attention  being  indirectly  paid  to distributional 
issues  through taking  explicit  note  of the  nature  of  the  respective  social  states  (for  
example,  of  the  income inequalities in the different states). The role of induced informational 
constraints  in generating impossibility  results is discussed in Sen  (1977c, 1979b) .

of  the utility loss of all the other Romans who suffered from the fire. But this does not require 
us to feel confident that we can put everyone's utilities in an exact one-to-one  correspondence 
with each other. There may,  thus, be room for demanding “partial comparability”— denying both the 
extremes: full com- parability  and  no comparability  at all. The  different  extents  of partial  
com- parability can be given mathematically exact forms (precisely articulating  the exact  extent  
of  inexactness) .ⁱ‘  It  can  also  be  shown  that  there  may  be  no general  need  for  
terribly  refined  interpersonal  comparisons  for  arriving  at definite  social  decisions.  
Quite  often,  rather  limited  levels  of  partial  com- parability will  be adequate  for making  
social  decisions."  Thus  the empirical exercise  need not be as ambitious as it is sometimes 
feared.
Before  proceeding  to  the  informational  basis  of  interpersonal  compari- sons, let me ask a 
big analytical  question:  how much  of a change  in  the pos- sibility  of  social  choice  is  
brought  about  by  systematic  use  of  interpersonal comparisons?  Do Arrow's  impossibility, and 
related  results, go away with  the use  of  interpersonal  comparisons  in  social  welfare 
judgments?  The  answer briefly   is,  yes.   The   additional   informational   availability   
allows   sufficient discrimination to escape impossibilities of this type.
There is an interesting contrast here. It can be shown that admitting cardi- nality of  utilities  
without interpersonal  comparisons does not change Arrow's impossibility   theorem   at  all,  
which   can   be  readily  extended   to  cardinal measurability  of  utilities  (see Theorem  8*2  
in  Sen,  1970a) . In  contrast  even ordinal interpersonal comparisons is adequate to break the 
exact impossibili- ty. We knew of  course  that with some  types of  interpersonal  comparisons de- 
manded  in  a full form  (including  cardinal  interpersonal  comparability) , we can  use  the 
classical  utilitarian  approach.” But it turns out that even weaker forms  of  comparability  
would  still  permit  making  consistent  social  welfare judgments,  satisfying  all  of Arrow's  
requirements,  in  addition  to  being  sen- sitive  to distributional concerns  (even  though  the 
possible  rules will  be con- fined to a relatively small class) ."
The distributional issue is, in fact, intimately connected with the need to go beyond voting rules 
as the basis of social welfare judgments. As was discussed earlier, utilitarianism too is in an 
important sense distribution  indifferent:  its program is to maximize the sum-total of utilities, 
no matter how unequally that total may be distributed  (the extensive  implications  of this 
distributional in-

difference  are  discussed  in  Sen,  1973a).  But  the  use  of interpersonal  com- parisons can 
take other forms as well, allowing public decisions  to be sensiti- ve to inequalities in 
well-being and  opportunities.
The broad approach  of social welfare functionals opens up  the  possibility of using many 
different types of social welfare rules, which differ in the treat- ment of equity as well as 
efficiency,  and  also in  their informational  require- ments."' Further, with the  removal of the 
 artificial barrier that had prohibited interpersonal  comparisons,  many  other  fields  of  
normative  measurement have also been investigated with the axiomatic approach of social welfare 
ana- lysis.  My  own  efforts  in  such  fields  as  the  evaluation  and  measurement  of 
inequaliq  (Sen,  1973a,  1992a,  1997b),  poverty  (Sen,  1976b,  1983b,  1985a, 1992a), 
distributton-adjusted national iacom (Sen, 1973b, 1976a, 1979a) , and en- vtronmental nofuotioa  
(Sen, 1995a),  have drawn solidly on  the broadened  in- formational framework of recent social 
choice  theory.”


VIII. INFORMATIONAL  BASIS OF INTERPERSONAL  COMPARISONS
While  the  analytical  issues in incorporating  interpersonal  comparisons  have been, on  the 
whole, well sorted  out,  there still  remains  the  important  prac- tical  matter  of finding  an 
 adequate  approach  to  the  empirical  discipline  of making  interpersonal  comparisons  and  
then  using  them  in  practice.  The foremost question  to be addressed is this: interpersonal 
comparison  of  m/tat? The  formal structures of social welfare functions are not, in any sense, 
spe- cific  to utility comparisons  only, and  they can incorporate  other  types of in- 
terpersonal comparisons as well. The  principal issue is the  choice of some ac- counting   of   
individual   advantage,   which   need   not   take   the   form   of comparisons of mental states 
of happiness, and  could instead focus on some other  way of  looking  at  individual  well-being  
or  freedom  or  substantive  op- portunities  (seen in the perspective of a corresponding 
evaluative discipline). The  rejection of interpersonal comparisons of utilities in welfare 
economic and  in social choice  theory  that followed  positivist criticism  (such  as that of 
Robbins,  1938)  was firmly  based  on  interpreting  them  entirely  as compari- sons of mental 
states. As it happens, even with such mental state comparisons, the case for unqualified  rejection 
is hard to sustain." Indeed, as has been for-


” On this and related issues, see Sen  (1970a, 1977c), Hammond  (1976) , d'Aspremont and Gevers

of interpersonal comparisons. Elster and John Roemer (1991)  have provided fine critical ac- counts 
of the vast literature on  this subject.
”  My work on  inequality  (beginning  with  Sen,  1973a)  has  been  particularly  influenced  by  
the pioneering  contributions  of Atkinson   ( 1970,  1983,  1989) .  The  literature  on  this  
subject  has grown  very fast in recent years;  for a critical scrutiny as well as references  to  
the contemporary literature, see James Foster and Sen  (1997) .

cefully  argued  by the  philosopher  Donald  Davidson  ( 1986) , it is difficult  to see  how 
people  can  understand  anything  much about other people's  minds and  feelings,  without  making 
 some  comparisons  with  their  own  minds  and feelings. Such comparisons may not be extremely 
precise, but then again, we know  from  analytical   investigations  that  very  precise   
interpersonal   com- parisons  may  not  be  needed  to  make  systematic  use  of  interpersonal  
com- parisons in social choice  (on this and related issues, see Sen, 1970a, c, 1997b; Blackorby,  
1975) .
So the picture is not so pessimistic  even in  the old home ground of mental state comparisons.  
But, more importantly,  interpersonal  comparisons  of per- sonal  welfare,  or  of  individual  
advantage,  need  not  be  based  only  on  com- parisons of mental states. In fact,  there  may be 
good ethical grounds for not concentrating  too much on mental-state  comparisons — whether of 
pleasures or of desires.  Utilities  may sometimes  be  very  malleable  in  response  to  per- 
sistent  deprivation.  A hopeless  destitute  with  much  poverty,  or  a downtrod- den laborer 
living under exploitative  economic  arrangements,  or a subjugat- ed housewife  in a society with  
entrenched gender inequality,  or a tyrannized citizen  under  brutal  authoritarianism, may come  
to  terms with  her depriva- tion. She may take whatever  pleasure  she can  from small  
achievements,  and adjust her desires to take note of feasibility (thereby helping the fulfilment 
of her adjusted desires) . But her success in such adjustment would not make her deprivation  go 
away. The metric of pleasure or desire may sometimes  be qui- te inadequate in reflecting  the 
extent of a person's substantive  deprivation.“ˢ There may indeed be a case for taking incomes, or 
commodity bundles, or resources more generally, to be of direct interest in judging a person's 
advan- tage, and this may be so for various reasons — not merely for the mental states they may 
help to generate."6  In fact, the Difference Principle in Rawls's ( 1971) theory  of  ‘justice  as  
fairness”  is  based  on judging  individual  advantage  in


"’  If interpersonal  comparisons  are  taken  to  be  entirely  a  matter  of opinions  or  of 
value judg- ments, then  the question can also be raised as to how the divergent opinions or 
valuations of dif- ferent  persons  may  be combined  together  (this  looks  like  a social  
choice  exercise  on  its own). Roberts  (1995)   has  extensively  investigated   this  particular 
 formulation,   taking  interpersonal comparison  to be an exercise of aggregation  of opinions. 
If, however, interpersonal comparisons are taken  to have a firmer factual basis (e.g., some people 
being objectively more miserable than others) ,  then  the  use  of interpersonal  comparisons  
will  call for a different  set of axiomatic  de- mands — more appropriate  for epistemology  than 
for ethics. For contrasting  perspectives on in- terpersonal comparisons of well-being, see Ian 
Little  (l9ñ7) , Sen (1970a, 1985b) , Tibor Scitovsky (1976) , Donald Davidson  (1986) , and 
C.ibbard  (1986) ; see also empirical studies of observed mi- sery  (for  example,   Dreze  and  
Sen,  1989,  1990,  1995,  1997;  Erik  Schokkaert  and  Luc  Van Ootegem, 1990; Robert M. Solow,  
1995) .

correlates;  see  Sen  (1979a) . See  also  the related  literature  on  “fairness,” seen  in

terms of  a person's  command  over what Rawls calls  “primary goods,” which are general-purpose 
resources  that are useful  for anyone  to  have  no  matter what her exact objectives are.
This  procedure  can  be  improved  upon  by  taking  note  not  only  of  the ownership  of  
primary  goods  and  resources,  but  also  of  interpersonal  dif- ferences  in  converting  them  
into  the  capability  to  live  well.  Indeed,  I  have tried  to  argue  in  favor  of  judging   
individual   advantage   in  terms  of  the respective  capabilities,  which  the  person  has,  to 
 live  the  way  he  or  she  has reason  to  value."  This  approach  focuses  on  the  
substantive  freedoms  that people  have,  rather  than  only  on  the  particular  outcomes  with  
which  they end  up.  For  responsible  adults,  the  concentration  on  freedom  rather  than only 
achievement  has some merit, and it can provide a general framework for analyzing  individual  
advantage  and  deprivation  in  a  contemporary  society. The extent of interpersonal comparisons 
may only be partial — often based on the intersection  of different points of view." But the use of 
such partial com- parability can make a major difference  to the informational  basis of reasoned 
social judgments.
However, given the nature of the subject and the practical difficulties  of in- formational   
availability  and  evaluation,  it  would   be  overambitious   to  be severely exclusive in 
sticking only to one informational approach, rejecting all others. In the recent literature  in 
applied welfare  economics, various ways of making   sensible   interpersonal   comparisons   of  
well-being   have   emerged. Some  have  been  based  on  studying  expenditure  patterns,  and  
using  this  to surmise  about  comparative  well-being  of  different  persons  (see  Pollak  and 
Terence  J.  Wales,  1979;  Dale  W.  Jorgenson   et  of.,  1980;  Jorgenson,   1990; Daniel  T. 
Slesnick,  1998) , while others  have combined  this with  other infor- mational  inputs  (see 
Angus S. Deaton  and John  Muellbauer,  1980; Atkinson and  Francois  Bourguignon,   1982,  1987;  
Fisher,  1987,  1990;  Pollak,  1991; Deaton, 1995) .'9  Others have tried to use questionnaires 
and have looked for regularities in people's answers to questions about relative well-being  (see, 
for example, Arie Kapteyn  and Bernard M. S. van Praag, 1976) .
There  have  also  been  illuminating  works  in  observing  important  features of living 
conditions and in drawing conclusions on quality of life and compa-

rative  living  standards  on  that  basis;  indeed  there  is a  well-established  tradi- tion  of 
 Scandinavian   studies  in  this  area  (see,  for  example,  Allardt  et  al. [1981] and Robert 
Erikson and Rune Aberg [1987] ) . The literature on “basic needs” and  their fulfilment  has also 
provided  an  empirical  approach  to  un- derstanding   comparative   deprivations.”  Further,   
under   the   intellectual leadership  of Mahbub ul Haq  (1995) , the United Nations Development  
Pro- gramme  (UNDP)  has  made  systematic  use  of  a  particular  type  of  informa- tional  
broadening to make comparisons  based on observed features of living conditions  (reported in UNDP, 
Human Development  Reports) .”
It is easy enough  to pick holes in each of these methodologies  and to criti- cize the related 
metrics of interpersonal  comparisons.  But there can  be little doubt about the welfare-economic 
interest in the far-reaching  uses of empiri- cal information  that have emerged from these works. 
They have substantially broadened  our  understanding  of  individual  advantages  and  their  
empirical correlates. Each of these methodologies clearly has some limitations as well as virtues, 
and our evaluation  of  their relative merits may well diverge, depend- ing on  our respective  
priorities.  I  have  had the  occasion  to argue  elsewhere (and briefly also in this lecture, 
earlier on) in favor of partial comparabilities based on evaluation of capabilities,3' but beyond 
that specific issue  (on which others  may  well  take  a different  view) ,  I want  to  emphasize 
 here  the  more general  point that the  possibilities  of  practical welfare  economics  and 
social choice  have  been  immensely  widened  through  these  innovative,  empirical works.
In fact, despite their differences,  they fit in general into the overall pattern of  informational 
 widening  to which  recent  analytical  work  in  social  choice theory  has forcefully  pointed.  
The analytical  systems  explored  in  the recent literature  on welfare  economics  and social 
choice are broader  than  those  in the Arrovian  model  (and correspondingly less uptight, and 
less “impossible,” on which see Sen, 1970a, 1977c)." They are also analytically general enough to 
allow  different  empirical  interpretations and  to  permit  alternative  infor- mational  bases 
for social choice.  The diverse  empirical  methodologies, con- sidered here, can all be seen in 
this broader analytical perspective. The move- ments in “high  theory” have been, in this sense, 
closely linked to the advances in  “practical  economics.”  It is  the sustained  exploration  of  
constructive  pos-

IX. POVERTY AND FAMINE
The variety of  information  on which  social welfare  analysis  can  draw can  be well illustrated 
by the study of poverty. Poverty is typically seen in terms of the lowness of  incomes, and it has 
been  traditionally  measured  simply  by count- ing  the  number  of  people  below  the  
poverty-line  income;  this  is sometimes called  the  head-count  measure. A scrutiny  of  this 
approach  yields  two diffe- rent  types  of  questions.  First,  is  poverty  adequately  seen  as 
 low  income? Second, even if poverty is seen as low income, is the aggregate poverty of a so- 
ciety best characterized  by the index of the head-count  measure?
I take up these questions in turn. Do we get enough  of a diagnosis  of indi- vidual  poverty  by  
comparing  the  individual's  income  with  a  socially  given poverty-line  income?  What about  
the  person  with  an  income well  above  the poverty  line,  who  suffers  from  an  expensive  
illness  (requiring,  say,  kidney dialysis) ?  Is deprivation  not  ultimately  a lack  of  
opportunity  to  lead  a mini- mally acceptable life, which can be influenced by a number of 
considerations, including  of  course  personal  income,  but  also  physical  and  environmental 
characteristics, and other variables  (such as the availability and costs of medi- cal  and  other  
facilities) ?  The  motivation   behind  such  an  exercise  relates closely  to seeing poverty as 
a serious deprivation  of certain  basic capabilities. This alternative approach  leads to a rather 
different diagnosis of poverty from the ones that a purely income-based  analysis can yield."
This is not to deny that lowness of income  can  be very important  in  many contexts, since the 
opportunities a person enjoys in a market economy can be severely constrained  by her level of real 
income. However, various contingen- cies can lead to variations in the “conversion” of income into 
the capability to live  a  minimally  acceptable  life,  and  if  that  is what we  are  concerned  
with, there  may be good reason  to look beyond income poverty. There are at least four different 
sources of variation:  (1) personal  heterogeneities (for example, proneness  to illness) ,  (2)  
environmental  diversities  (for example,  living  in a storm-prone  or flood-prone  area),  (3)  
variations  in social climate  (for exam- ple, the prevalence  of crime or epidemiological vectors) 
, and (4) differences in relative deprivation  connected with customary patterns of consumption  in 
particular  societies   (for  example,   being  relatively  impoverished  in  a  rich

and Sen  (1989, 1995) , Griffin and Knight  (1990) , Iftekhar  Hossain  (1990) , Schokkaert and Van 
Ootegem  (1990) , Nussbaum and Sen  (1993) , Anand and Sen  (1997) , and Foster and Sen  ( 1997) , 
among other contributions.

society, which can lead to deprivation of the absolute capability to take part in
the  life of the  community) .”
There  is,  thus,  an  important  need  to  go  beyond  income  information  in poverty   analysis, 
  in   particular   to   see   poverty   as   capability   deprivation. However  (as was discussed  
earlier),  the choice of  the  informational  base for poverty analysis cannot  really be 
dissociated  from  pragmatic considerations, particularly  informational  availability.  It  is  
unlikely  that  the  perspective  of poverty as income deprivation  can  be dispensed  with in  the 
empirical  litera- ture  on  poverty,  even  when  the  limitations  of  that  perspective  are  
entirely clear. Indeed, in many contexts  the  rough-and-ready way of using income in- formation  
may  provide  the  most immediate  approach  to the  study of severe deprivation.”
For example,  the causation  of famines is often best seen in terms of a radi- cal decline in the 
real incomes of a section of the  population, leading to star- vation  and  death  (on  this see 
Sen, 1976d, 1981) .”  The  dynamics of income earning and of purchasing power may indeed be the 
most important compo- nent of a famine investigation. This approach, in which the study of causal 
in- fluences on  the  determination  of the  respective  incomes of different groups plays a 
central part, contrasts with an exclusive focus on agricultural  produc- tion and  food supply, 
which is often found in the literature on  this subject.
The  shift in  informational  focus from  food supply  to entitlements  (invol- ving incomes as 
well as supply,  and  the  resulting relative  prices)  can  make  a radical difference, since 
famines can occur even without any major decline — possibly  without  any  decline  at  all  —  of  
food  production  or  supply.”  If,  for example,  the  incomes  of  rural  wage  laborers,  or  of 
 service  providers,  or  of craftsmen collapse through  unemployment, or through a fall of real 
wages, or through  a decline  in  the  demand for the relevant services or  craft products, the 
affected groups may have  to starve, even if the  overall food supply in  the economy is 
undiminished. Starvation occurs when some people cannot estab- lish  entitlement  over  an  
adequate  amount  of  food,  through   purchase  or

"  On this see Sen  (1992a)  and Foster and Sen  (1997) . The last concern — that a relative 
depriva- tion  of income  can  lead to an absolute  deprivation  of a basic  capability — was first 
discussed  by Adam Smith  (1776). Adam Smith’s claim  that “necessary goods” (and correspondingly 
minimum incomes  needed  to avoid  basic  deprivation)  must  be defined  differently  for 
different  societies also suggests a general approach  of using a parametrically variable  
“poverty-line” income.  Such variations  can  be  used  to  reflect  the  disparate  conditions  of 
different  persons  (including,  for example,  proneness  to  illness).  On  these  issues,  see  
Deaton  and  Muellbauer   (1980,  1966) , Jorgenson  (1990) , Pollak  (1991) , Deaton  (1995) ,  
and  Slesnick  (1998) ,  among  other  contribu- tions.  Under  certain  conditions,  the 
definition  of poverty as having an  income  below  the para- metrically  determined  “poverty  
line” will  be  congruent  with  the  characterization  of  poverty  as capability  deprivation  
(if the  parametric  variations  are  firmly  linked  to  the  income  needed  to avoid specified 
levels of capability deprivation).
*  These issues are insightfully scrutinized  by Philippe Van Parijs  ( 1995) .

“   As empirical  studies of famines bring out, some actual famines have occurred with  litHe or no 
decline in food production  (such as the Bengal famine of 1943, the Ethiopian  famine of 1973, or 
the Bangladesh  famine of 1974) , whereas others have  been  influenced  substantially  by declines 
in food production  (on this see Sen, 1981) .

196                                        Economic  Sciences  1998

through  food production, and the overall supply of  food is only one influen- ce  among  many  in  
the  determination  of  the  entitlements  of  the  respective groups of people  in  the economy.  
Thus, an income-sensitive entitlement  ap- proach  can  provide  a  better  explanation  of  
famines  than  can  be  obtained through  an  exclusively  production-oriented view. It can  also 
yield a more ef- fective approach  to the remedying of starvation  and hunger  (on this see par- 
ticularly Dreze and Sen, 1989) .
The  nature  of  the  problem  tends  to  identify  the  particular  “space”  on which  the 
analysis has to concentrate.  It remains true  that in explaining  the exact patterns of famine 
deaths and sufferings, we can get additional  under- standing  by  supplementing  the  income-based 
 analysis  with  information  on the  conversion  of  incomes  into  nourishment,  which  will  
depend  on  various other influences such as metabolic rates, proneness to illness, body size, 
etc.” These  issues  are  undoubtedly  important  for  investigating  the  incidence  of 
nutritional failures, morbidities, and mortalities. However,  in a general analy- sis of  the 
occurrence  and causation  of famines,  affecting  large groups,  these additional  matters  may be 
of secondary  importance.  While  I shall  not enter further into the famine literature  here, I 
would like to emphasize  that the in- formational  demands  of  famine  analysis give  an  
important  place  to  income deprivation  which  have  more  immediacy  and  ready  usability  than 
 the  more subtle — and ultimately more informed — distinctions  based on capability com- parisons  
(on this see Sen  [1981] and Dreze and Sen  [1989] ) .
I turn now to the second question. The most common and most traditional measure of poverty had 
tended to concentrate on head counting. But it must also make a difference  as to how far below the 
poverty line the poor individu- ally are, and furthermore,  how the deprivation  is shared and 
distributed among the  poor.  The  social  data  on  the  respective  deprivations  of  the  
individuals who constitute  the poor in a society need to be aggregated  together to arrive at  
informative  and  usable  measures  of  aggregate  poverty.  This  is  a  social choice problem, 
and axioms can indeed be proposed that attempt to capture our  distributional  concerns  in  this  
constructive  exercise  (on  this  see  Sen, 1976b).'
Several  distribution-sensitive  poverty  measures  have  been  derived  axio- matically  in  the  
recent  social  choice  literature,  and  various  alternative  pro- posals  have  been  analyzed.  
While  I shall,  here,  not go into a comparative  as- sessment  of  these  measures  (nor  into  
axiomatic  requirements  that  can  be


”  An  important  further  issue  is  the  distribution  of  food  u'tffiizi  the  family,  which  
may  be  in- fluenced  by several factors other  than  family income. Issues of gender  inequality  
and  the  treat- ment of children and of old people can be important in  this context. Entitlement 
analysis can be extended  in  these directions by going beyond  the family income into the 
conventions  and  rules of intrafamily division.  On  these issues, see Sen  ( 1983a, b, 1984, 
1990) , Vaughan  (1987) ,  Dreze and  Sen  (1989) ,  Barbara  Harriss  (1990) ,  Bina  Agarwal  
(1994) ,  Nancy  Folbre  ( 1995) ,  Kanbur (1995), and  Nussbaum  and Jonathan Glover  (1995) , 
among other contributions.
'    The  so-called  “Sen  measure  of poverty” can, in fact, be improved  by an important  but 
simple variation illuminatingly proposed  by Anthony F. Shorrocks  (1995) . I have to confess 
favoring  the “Sen-Shorroc ks measure” over the original  “Sen  index.”

used  to  discriminate  between  them),  elsewhere  I  have  tried  to  address  this issue, 
jointly with James  Foster  (Foster  and  Sen,  1997)     However,  I  would like to emphasize  the 
fact that we face here an embarrassment of riches  (the opposite  of  an  impasse  or an  
impossibility) , once  the  informational  basis of social judgments  has been appropriately  
broadened. To axiomatize  exactly a particular poverty measure, we shall have to indulge in the 
“brinkmanship” of which  I spoke earlier  (Section  V) , by adding  other axiomatic  demands  until 
we are just short of an impossibility, with only one surviving poverty measure.

X. COMPARATIVE  DEPRIVATION AND GENDER INEQUALITY
At one level, poverty cannot  be dissociated from  the misery caused  by it, and in this sense, the 
classical perspective  of utility also can be invoked in this ana- lysis.  However,  the  
malleability  of  mental  attitudes,  on  which  I  commented earlier, may tend to hide and muffle 
the extent of deprivation  in many cases. The indigent peasant who manages  to build some cheer in 
his life should not be taken as nonpoor on grounds of his mental accomplishment.
This  adaptability  can  be  particularly  important  in  dealing  with  gender inequality and 
deprivation  of women  in traditionally unequal societies. This is partly  because  perceptions  
have a decisive  part to play in  the cohesion  of fa- mily life, and the culture  of family living 
 tends  to put a premium  on making allies out of the ill treated. Women  may — often enough — work 
much  harder than  men  (thanks to  the rigours of  household  chores) , and also  receive  less 
attention in health care and nutrition, and yet the perception  that there is an incorrigible  
inequality  here  may well  be  missing  in  a society  in  which  asym- metric  norms are quietly 
dominant."This type of  inequality and deprivation may  not,  under  these  circumstances,  
adequately  surface  in  the  scale  of  the mental metric of dissatisfaction and discontent.
The socially  cultivated  sense  of  contentment  and serenity  may even  affect the perception of 
morbidity and illness. When, many years ago, I was working on a famine-related study of post-famine 
Bengal in 1944, I was quite struck by the  remarkable  fact  that  the widows  surveyed  had  
hardly reported  any inci- dence  of  being  in  “indifferent  health,”  whereas  widowers,  
complained  mas- sively about just that (Sen, 1985a Appendix  B). Similarly,  it emerges in inter- 
state comparisons in India that the states that are worst provided in education

is an extensive  bibliography of this large literature  in Foster and  Sen, 1997) . One  of the 
important issues  to be addressed is the need  for  — and     limitations  of  —  “decomposability” 
 (and  the  weaker  requirement  of  “subgroup consistency,”  on  which  see also Shorrocks, 1984) 
. Foster  (1984)  gives arguments in favor  of de- composability   (as  did  Anand,  1977,  1983) , 
 whereas  Sen  (1973a,  1977c)   presents  arguments against  it. There  is a serious  attempt  in  
Foster  and  Sen  (1997)  to assess  both  the  pros and  the cons of decomposability and  subgroup 
consistency.
’" On  this see Sen  ( 1984, 1990, l993c) , and  the literature cited  there.

and  health-care  facilities  typically  report  the  lowest  levels  of  perceived  mor- bidity,  
whereas  states  with  good  health  care  and  school  education  indicate higher self-perception 
of  illness  (with  the  highest  morbidity  reports  coming from  the  best provided  states, such 
 as Kerala).‘3  Mental  reactions,  the  main- stay of classical utility, can  be a very defective 
basis for the analysis of depriva- tion.
Thus,  in  understanding  poverty  and  inequality,  there  is a strong  case  for looking at real 
deprivation  and  not  merely at mental  reactions to that depri- vation. There have been many 
recent investigations of gender inequality and women's deprivation  in terms of undernutrition, 
clinically diagnosed morbi- dity,  observed  illiteracy,  and   even  unexpectedly  high  mortality 
 (compared with physiologicallyjustified expectations).“ Such interpersonal comparisons can easily 
be a significant basis of studies of poverty and of inequality between the sexes. They can  be 
accommodated  within  a broad  framework  of welfare economics and social choice  (enhanced  by the 
removal of informational con- straints that would rule out the use of these types of data).

XI. THE LIBERAL  PARADOX
This  lecture  has included  discussion  of  why and how impossibility  results in social  choice  
can  be  overcome  through  informational  broadening.  The  in- formational widening considered  
so far has been  mainly concerned with  the use  of  interpersonal  comparisons.  But  this  need  
not  be  the  only  form  of broadening that is needed in resolving an impasse in social choice. 
Consider, for example, an impossibility  theorem which is sometimes referred to as “the liberal  
paradox,” or “the impossibility of  the Paretian  liberal” (Sen,  1970a,  b, 1976c) . The theorem 
shows the impossibility of satisfying even a very minimal demand  for  liberty when  combined  with 
 an  insistence  on  Pareto  efficiency (given  unrestricted domain) .’S
Since there have been some debates on the content of liberty in the recent literature  (see,  for  
example,  Nozick,  1974;  Peter  Gardenfors,  1981;  Robert Sugden,  1981,  1985,  1993;  Hil1e1  
Steiner,  1990;  Gaertner  et  al.,  1992;  Deb,
1994; Marc Fleurbaey and Gaertner, 1996; Pattanaik,  1996; Suzumura,  1996) , perhaps  a quick  
explanatory  remark  may  be  useful.  Liberty  has  many diffe- rent  aspects,  including  two  
rather  distinct  features:  ( 1)  it  can  help  us  to


"  The methodological issue underlying  this problem involves “positional objectivity”—what is ob- 
servationally objective  from a given position  but may not be sustainable  in  interpositional 
compa- risons. This contrast and its far-reaching relevance  is discussed  in Sen  (l99Sc) .
“  The literature on “missing women” (in comparison with the expected number of women in the 
absence  of unusually  high  feminine  mortality  rates found  in  some  societies)  is one example 
 of such  empirical  analysis;  on  this see  Sen  (1984,  1992c) , Vaughan  (1987) , Dreze  and  
Sen  (1989, 1990) ,  Ansley J.   Coale  (1991) ,  and  Stephan  Klasen  (1994) .  See  also Jocelyn 
 Kynch  and  Sen (1953) ;  Harriss  (1990) ;  Ravi  Kanbur  and  Lawrence  Haddad  (1990) ;  
Agarwal  (1994) ;  Folbre (1995) ; Nussbaum  and Glover  ( 1995) , among other works.
*  There  is also some analytical  interest in  the  “source” of  the impossibility result involved 
 here, particularly since both “Pareto efficiency” and “minimal liberty” are characterized  in 
terms of the same set of preferences  of the same individuals.  On this see Sen  (1976c, 1992b) .

achieve what we would choose  to achieve  in our respective  private  domains, for example,  in 
personal  life  (this is its “opportunity  aspect”), and  (2)  it can leave us directly in charge 
of choices over private domains, no matter what we may or may not achieve  (this is its “process 
aspect”).  In social choice  theory, the formulation  of liberty has been primarily concerned with 
the former, that is, the opportunity aspect. This may have  been adequate  to show the possible 
conflict  between  the  Pareto  principle  and  the  opportunity  aspect of liberty (on which Sen  
[1970a,  b] concentrated), but an exclusive  concentration  on the opportunity aspect cannot 
provide an adequate understanding  of the de- mands  of liberty  (in  this  respect,  Sugden  
[1981,  1993]  and  Gaertner  et  al. [1992]  were  certainly  right  to reject  the  sufficiency  
of the  opportunity-cen- tered formulation  in standard social choice theory).” However, social 
choice theory  can  also  be  made   to  accommodate   the  process  aspect  of  liberty through  
appropriate  recharacterization,  and  particularly  through  valuing due process in addition  to 
substantive opportunities  (on this see Sen, 1982b, 1997a,  1999b;  Stig  Kanger,  1985;  Deb,  
1994;  Hammond,  1997;  Suzumura, 1996; Martin van Hees, 1996) .
It is also important  to avoid the opposite  narrowness  of concentrating  ex- clusively only on 
the process aspect of liberty, as some recent writers have pre- ferred to do. Important as 
processes are, this cannot obliterate  the relevance of the opportunity aspect which  too must 
count. Indeed, the importance of ef- fectiveness in the realization  of liberty in one's personal 
life has been  recogni- zed as important  for a long time — even  by commentators  deeply concerned 
with   processes,   from  John   Stuart   Mill   (1859)   to   Frank   Knight   (1947) , Friedrich 
A. Hayek  (1960) , and Buchanan  (1986). The difficulties  of having to weigh process fairness 
against effectiveness of outcomes cannot be avoided simply  by  ignoring  the  opportunity  aspect  
of liberty,  through  an  exclusive concentration  on the process aspect."
How might  the conflict  of the Paretian  liberal,  in  particular,  be resolved? Different ways of 
dealing with  this friction  have  been  explored  in  the  litera- ture.4’ However,  it is 
important to see that unlike Arrow's impossibility result, the liberal paradox cannot be 
satisfactorily resolved through the use of inter- personal  comparisons.   Indeed,  neither  the  
claims  of  liberty,  nor  that  of Pareto efficiency, need be significantly contingent on 
interpersonal compari-

* The  “imprissibility of the Paretian liberal” does not, however, get  resolved simply by 
concentra- ting on  the process aspect of liberty, on which see Friedrich  Breyer  (1977) , Breyer

sons. The force of one's claims over one's private domain  lies in  the personal nature of  that 
choice — not on the relative intensities  of  the preferences of dif- ferent  persons  over a 
particular  person's  private  life. Also,  Pareto  efficiency depends on the congruence of 
different persons' preferences over a pairwise choice — not on  the comparative  strength  of those 
preferences.
Rather,  the  resolution  of  this  problem  lies  elsewhere,  in  particular  in  the need to see 
each  of these claims as  being qualified  by the importance  of the other — once  it is recognized 
 that  they can  be in  possible  conflict with  each other (indeed, the main point of the liberal 
paradox was precisely to identify that possible conflict) . The recognition  of the importance of 
effective liberty in one's private domain  (precisely over particular choices)  can coexist with an 
acknowledgement of the relevance  of Paretian  unanimity over any pair  (over all choices—whether 
in one's private domain or not) . A satisfactory resolution of this impossibility  must include  
taking an  evaluative  view of  the acceptable priorities between personal liberty and overall 
desire fulfillment, and must be sensitive  to the information  regarding  the  trade-offs on this 
that the persons may themselves endorse. This too calls for an informational  enrichment  (tak- ing 
note of people's political values as well as individual desires) , but this en- richment  is of a 
rather different  kind from  that of using interpersonal  com- parisons of well-being  or overall 
advantage."


XII. A CONCLUDING  REMARK
Impossibility  results  in  social  choice  theory — led  by the  pioneering  work of Arrow  (19a1) 
— have often been  interpreted as being thoroughly destructive of the possibility of reasoned and 
democratic  social choice, including welfare economics   (Sections  I-III,  XI).  I  have  argued  
against  that  view.  Indeed, Arrow's  powerful  “impossibility  theorem”  invites  engagement,  
rather  than resignation  (Sections IV-V) . We do know, of course, that democratic decisions can 
sometimes lead to incongruities. To the extent that this is a feature of the real  world,  its  
existence  and  reach  are  matters  for  objective  recognition. Inconsistencies arise more 
readily in some situations  than  in others, and it is possible  to identify the situational  
differences and to characterize  the proces- ses   through   consensual   and  compatible   
decisions   can   emerge   (Sections VI—VIII).
The  impossibility  results  certainly  deserve  serious  study.  They  often  have wide  —  indeed 
 sweeping  —  reach,  not  merely  covering  day-to-day  politics (where we may be rather used to 
incongruity) , but also questioning  the pos- sibility of any assured framework for making social 
welfare judgments  for the society as a whole. Impossibilities thus identified  also militate 
against  the ge-


’9  This may,  formally,  require  a multistage  social  choice  exercise  in  the  determination  
of these priorities, followed  by the use of those  priorities in  the choice  over comprehensive  
social states (on  these issues, see Pattanaik,  1971; Sen, 1982b, 1992b, 1996, 1997a; Suzumura,  
1996, 1999) .

neral  possibility  of  an  orderly and  systematic  framework  for  normatively  as- sessing 
inequality, for evaluating  poverty, or  for identifying intolerable  tyran- ny and  violations of 
liberty. Not to be able  to have a coherent framework for these appraisals or evaluations would 
indeed be most damaging for systematic political,  social,  and  economic  judgement.  It would  
not  be  possible  to  talk about injustice and  unfairness without having to face the accusation  
that such diagnoses must be inescapably arbitrary or intellectually despotic.
These  bleak  conclusions  do  not,  however,  endure searching  scrutiny,  and fruitful procedures 
that militate against such pessimism can be clearly identi- fied. This has indeed been largely an 
upbeat lecture — emphasizing the possi- bility of constructive social choice theory, and  arguing 
for a productive  inter- pretation   of   the  impossibility   results.   Indeed,   these  
apparently   negative results can  be seen  to  be  helpful  inputs in  the development  of  an 
adequate framework  for  social  choice,  since  the  axiomatic  derivation   of  a  specific 
social choice procedure  must lie in between — and     close  to — an impossibility, on one side, 
and  an embarrassment of riches, on the other  (see Section V).
The  possibility  of  constructive  welfare  economics  and  social  choice  (and their   use  in   
making  social  welfare  judgments   and   in   devising   practical measures with normative 
significance)  turns on the need for broadening the informational  basis of such  choice.  
Different  types of  informational  enrich- ment  have  been  considered   in   the  literature.  A 
 crucial  element  in  this broadening is the use of interpersonal  comparisons of well-being and  
indivi- dual  advantage.  It is not  surprising  that  the  rejection  of  interpersonal  com- 
parisons must cause difficulties for reasoned social decision, since  the claims of  different  
persons,  who  make  up  the  society,  have  to  be  assessed  against each  other. We  cannot 
even  understand  the force  of  public  concerns about poverty,  hunger,  inequality,  or  
tyranny,  without  bringing  in  interpersonal comparisons in one form or another. The information  
on which our  informal judgments on  these matters rely is precisely  the kind of information  that 
has to be — and     can  be — incorporated  in  the  formal analysis of systematic  social choice  
(Sections VII—XI).
The    pessimism  about  the  possibility  of  interpersonal  comparisons  that fuelled  the  
“obituary  notices”  for  welfare  economics  (and  substantially  fed the fear of impossibility in 
social choice theory) was ultimately misleading for two  distinct  reasons.  First,  it  confined  
attention  to  too  narrow  an  informa- tional base, overlooking the different ways in which 
interpersonally compara- tive statements can sensibly be made and can be used to enrich the 
analysis of welfare judgments  and  social choice. An overconcentration on comparisons of  mental  
states crowded  out  a  plethora  of  information  that can  inform  us about  the  real advantages 
 and  disadvantages of different  persons,  related  to their  substantive  well-being,  freedoms,  
or  opportunities. Second,  the  pessi- mism was also based on demanding too much precision in such 
comparisons, overlooking  the fact that even partial comparisons can serve to enlighten  the 
reasoned  basis of welfare economics, social ethics, and  responsible  politics.”
Addressing  these problems fits well into a general program  of strengthen- ing social choice 
theory (and “nonobituarial” welfare economics). In general,

informational  broadening, in one form or another, is an effective way of  over- coming  social  
choice  pessimism  and of avoiding  impossibilities, and it leads directly to constructive  
approaches with viability and reach. Formal reasoning about  postulated  axioms  (including  their  
compatibility  and  coherence) ,  as well as informal understanding  of values and norms  
(including their relevan- ce and plausibility) , both point in that productive direction. Indeed, 
the deep complementarity between  formal and informal reasoning — so central  to the social 
sciences — is well illustrated  by developments  in modern  social  choice theory.

'    There are  two distinct issues here. First, partial comparability  can  be very effective  in 
genera- ting an optimal choice  (Sen, 1970a, c). Second, even when an optimal alternative does not 
emer- ge, it can help to narrow down the maximal set of undominated  alternatives to which a 
maximi- zing choice can be confined  (Sen 1973a, 1993a, 1997a) .
