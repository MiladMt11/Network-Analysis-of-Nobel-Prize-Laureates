INTRODUCTION
The story that Mike Bishop and I will tell in these two lectures is one in
which retroviruses, oncogenes, our personal histories, and the history of
tumor virology are closely interwoven. It begins with some simple questions
about the origin and behavior of viral genes and takes us to a vantage point
from which we can survey many aspects of retroviruses and animal cells,
including some of the aberrations that lead to cancer. We now know that
retroviruses capture normal cellular genes and convert them to cancer-
causing genes, called oncogenes. Such transductions are rare, but depend
upon the normal events of an intricate virus life cycle. Retroviruses have
introduced us to more than forty cellular genes with the potential to
become oncogenes, some discovered as components of viral genomes,
others as genetic targets for viral insertion mutations.
   It has been our privilege to participate in a generous share of the
experiments that established these principles. But we have required the
help of many talented people in our laboratories at UCSF, as well as the
collaboration and friendly competition of others elsewhere. (I mention as
many names as the narrative can bear, but inevitably I must apologize to
valued colleagues who remain anonymous here.) Several viruses also figure
in our tale, but Rous sarcoma virus again has the leading role, yet another of
many tributes to the pioneering work of Peyton Rous and to the principle of
delayed gratification in science. The product of his diligence in pursuing a
single chicken tumor nearly eighty years ago (1), Rous’ virus remains the
only retrovirus that could have satisfied the genetic and biochemical criteria
for the work we accomplished in the era that preceded molecular cloning.

 FIRST TASTE OF MOLECUALR BIOLOGY: HYBRIDIZATIONS WITH
 THE LAC OPERON
 My commitment to experimental science occurred, by today’s standards,
 dangerously late in a prolonged adolescence. As an undergraduate at Am-
 herst College, I was devoted to Dickensian novels and anti-Establishment
journalism, while marginally fulfilling premedical requirements. I then
 indulged myself with a year of Anglo-Saxon and metaphysical poetry at
 Harvard graduate school, before beginning medical studies at Columbia

 University, with a primary interest in psychiatry. But my ambitions soon
 turned towards an academic career in internal medicine. So just after
 graduation in 1966, like many of my contemporaries, I applied for research
 training at the National Institutes of Health. Perhaps because his wife was a
 poet, Ira Pastan agreed to take me into his laboratory, despite my lack of
 scientific credentials.
    At the time, Ira was studying the biochemical effects of thyroid stimulat-
 ing hormone on tissue slices, a subject close enough to clinical endocrinol-
 ogy not to be intimidating. But one day, while still an intern at Colum-
 bia-presbyterian Hospital, I received a telephone call from Ira, telling me
 that a lecture by Earl Sutherland had inspired him to begin work on the
 effects of cyclic AMP on regulation of the lac operon in E.coli. Late that
 night, alone in the house staff library, I peered for the first time into the
Journal of Molecular Biology - it is no small tribute to Columbia that this
journal was there - and attempted to read the seminal papers on the lac
 operon by Jacob and Monod (2). I knew then that, one way or another, my
 life was about to change.
    Science is largely the making of measurements, and I soon learned from
 Ira how much more important a new measurement could be than an old
 theory. He and Bob Perlman had just discovered that cyclic AMP reversed
 catabolite repression of the lac operon (3). They suggested that I use the
 relatively new technique of molecular hybridization to ask whether regula-
 tion by cyclic AMP occurs at the transcriptional level. Apart from the
 pleasure of just getting results (as Gunther Stent has said, results are
 wonderful because they give us something to talk about (4) these measure-
 ments had enormous intellectual appeal, because they very simply resolved
 the ambiguity of hypothesis, demonstrating unequivocal changes in synthe-
 sis of lac messenger RNA (5). Furthermore, they were carried out with
 technical subtleties that ultimately shaped the way I later thought about the
 problems of detecting single genes in more complex, eukaryotic cells. We
 annealed radiolabeled E.coli RNA to filter-bound DNA from a pair of
 bacteriophages that differed only by the presence or absence of the l a c
 operon; and we minimized irrelevant hybridization by including, as com-
 petitor, unlabeled RNA from an E.coli mutant from which the lac operon
 was deleted. An aesthetic merger of genetics with molecular biology, itself
 as pleasing as the results!

INTRODUCTION TO THE PROVIRUS AND THE VIROGENE-
ONCOGENE HYPOTHESES
A major feature of life at the NIH in late 1960’s was the extraordinary
offering of evening courses for physicians attempting to become scientists
as they neared thirty. Two classes had direct and specific effects on my
subsequent work because they introduced me to important problems I
believed approachable with the methods I had acquired in my brief appren-
ticeship.
   Like many of my peers, I was excited by the prospect of applying reduc-


506



tionist methods to eukaryotic organisms, particularly in a way that might be
informative about human disease. From some dilatory reading in the early
1960’s, I knew enough about viruses and their association with tumors in
animals to understand that they might provide a relatively simple entry into
a problem as complex as cancer. In fact, for anyone interested in the
genetic basis of cancer, viruses seemed to be the only game in town. What
surprised and beckoned me were two rather simple but heretical hypotheses
that described curious ways the genes of RNA tumor viruses might mingle
with the chromosomes of host cells.
   The more daring of these two hypotheses was the provirus hypothesis,
first enunciated by Howard Temin (6). (John Bader, one of our NIH
 lecturers, was among the few others to espouse it in public (7).) The
 provirus hypothesis stated that the genes of RNA tumor viruses were copied
into DNA, which became stably associated with the host cell; the proviral
DNA then provided the information for production of new virus particles.
With its existence supported principally       some said feebly     by studies
with inhibitors of DNA and RNA synthesis, and its plausibility doubted in
the absence of any precedent for information transfer from RNA to DNA,
the provirus seemed to be a provocative target for a definitive decision with
molecular hybridization.
   The other hypothesis, the virogene-oncogene hypothesis, was more com-
plex (8). George Todaro and Robert Huebner proposed that normal cells
must contain genes related to those found in RNA tumor viruses, since viral
proteins could often be found in cells of apparantly uninfected animals,
especially chickens and mice. Such genes, known as virogenes, were be-
lieved to be transmitted vertically as components of chromosomes, ex-
pressed in response to a variety of agents, and acquired by infection of germ
cells at some time in the past. Since some RNA tumor viruses were known to
be highly oncogenic, it was also proposed that tumor-inducing genes of
such viruses (viral oncogenes) might also be transmitted through the germ
line as a consequence of ancient infection. Activation of these endogenous
viral oncogenes by substances we recognize as carcinogens           chemicals,
radiation, other viruses     could serve to initiate a neoplastic process.

TRANSITION TO RNA TUMOR VIROLOGY IN REVOLUTIONARY
TIMES
During the summer of 1969, I combined a backpacking vacation in Califor-
nia with a search for a suitable place to study tumor viruses. Acting on a tip
from Harry Rubin in Berkeley, I sought out a small group, composed of
Mike Bishop, Leon Levintow, and Warren Levinson, that was beginning to
work with Rous sarcoma virus at UC San Francisco. (Rubin, it should be
said, was more eager for me to meet Peter Duesberg, but Duesberg was out
of town.) A brief conversation with Mike was sufficient to convince me of
our intellectual compatibility (happily, one of the few convictions to have
survived twenty years in this field), and I made plans to join the UCSF group
as a post-doctoral fellow the following summer.


   Before the intervening year had passed, however, two major discoveries
changed the landscape of tumor virology. Satoshi Mizutani and Temin (9)
and David Baltimore (10) found the predicted enzyme, reverse transcrip-
tase, in virus particles, thereby erasing most of the skepticism about the
provirus hypothesis by providing a means to synthesize the heretical DNA
copy of an RNA genome. And Steve Martin isolated a crucial mutant of
Rous sarcoma virus (11), one that lost its ability to transform cells at
elevated temperature and regained it when the temperature was reduced.
Martin’s mutant offered the first clear definition of the gene we later called
src, and it showed that the gene      and, by implication, a protein the gene
encoded      was required to instigate and sustain the transformed state.
Since the mutant virus grew normally at the temperature that blocked
transformation, oncogenic and replicative functions could be dissociated, a
facet of the story that will soon resurface.

FIRST FORAYS WITH RSV: SEEKING PROVIRAL DNA
Reverse transcriptase was properly greeted as strong evidence for the
provirus hypothesis, and defused the urgency of challenging it. Yet it still
seemed important to detect the provirus directly, most obviously by molecu-
lar hybridization, and to follow the pathway of its synthesis, especially in
infected cells, not just in vitro. Reverse transcriptase obligingly offered a
means to simplify the job, through the synthesis of potentially powerful
probes, radioactive virus-specific DNA copied from a template of viral
RNA.
   Some of my initial efforts to proceed with these problems look, in
retrospect, frustrating, if not quixotic   though the results were published
in prominent journals. We chose at first to use double-stranded products of
the RSV reverse transcriptase as hybridization probes, in order to measure
gene copies through the accelerating effects of cellular DNA on reassocia-
tion kinetics (12). However, the RNA template was unevenly copied by
reverse transcriptase in vitro (13), so that the products had complicated
reannealing kinetics and did not uniformly represent the viral genome
(whose genetic composition was in any case still unknown.) When I attempt-
ed to measure RSV-related DNA in the most obvious settings            uninfected
and RSV-infected chicken cells        I found multiple copies of virus-related
DNA in the normal cells, in apparent confirmation of at least some aspects
of the virogene-oncogene hypothesis (14). But I was unable to detect the
anticipated increment of RSV DNA in infected chicken cells, until I
switched to the use of single-stranded DNA as probes (15). But by then Paul
Neiman had already measured the increment by hybridization with radiola-
beled RNA from virions (16). And, in the meantime, Hill and Hillova had
provided more dramatic support for the provirus hypothesis in an entirely
different way, by DNA transfection: addition of DNA from RSV-infected
cells to new cells allowed the recovery of the original virus (17). So the entire
viral genome must have been present in the DNA of infected cells.
   Our approach to the provirus was eased when I abandoned chicken cells,

the traditional hosts for RSV in culture, in favor of cells from other birds
ducks and quail       and from mammals (18). Because we could detect little
virus-related DNA in these cells prior to infection, it was relatively simple to
measure new copies of RSV DNA following infection, to follow the time
course of DNA synthesis, to show that reverse transcription occurred in the
cytoplasm, and to define linear, circular, and integrated forms of viral DNA
(19).



MAKING A PROBE TO TEST THE VIROGENE-ONCOGENE
HYPOTHESIS
The varied abilities of normal avian DNAs to anneal to RSV-derived probes
helped to focus our attention upon the sorts of virus-related sequence we
could detect in chicken DNA. Did these sequences constitute genes for viral
structural proteins? More importantly, did they include the viral transform-
ing gene, as predicted by the oncogene-virogene hypothesis? To approach
these questions it was imperative to have more rigorously defined probes.
This was not a trivial challenge in the early 1970’s, before restriction mapping
and molecular cloning were available to us.
   But one potent reagent was available. In 1971, Peter Vogt reported the
isolation of transformation-defective, replication-competent mutants of
RSV (20). The genomic RNA subunits of these “td” mutants were shown by
Duesberg and his colleagues to be about 15 percent shorter than the
subunits of wildtype virus (21). The provisional interpretation was that the
missing sequence (initially called “x” and later “sarc”) included some or all
of the viral transforming gene (v-src) earlier defined by temperature-sensi-
tive mutants. Like Martin’s ts mutants, the deletion mutants retained the
functions required for replication, despite the extensive loss of sequence, so
it was tempting to presume that the deletion was coextensive, or nearly
coextensive, with the transforming gene.
   Mike and I were intimately acquainted with these conjectures through a
collaborative consortium of Californian laboratories, directed by Vogt,
Duesberg, and us, which met every six weeks or so, in Los Angeles or the
Bay Area. Through these discussions, we recognized that if we could pre-
pare radioactive DNA specific for the sequences deleted in the td-RSV
mutants, we would have a reagent that would approximate a specific probe
for the transforming gene of RSV.
   The strategy for doing this was straightforward in principal, but difficult
in practice (Fig. 1A). In essence, single-stranded, radiolabeled DNA frag-
ments were synthesized from a template of wild-type RSV RNA, then
hybridized to td-RSV RNA to remove unwanted components by hydroxyla-
patite-chromatography, leaving the sarc-specific DNA. Ramareddy Guntaka
first put this protocol into motion with some encouraging results. But it was
ultimately the ministrations of Dominique Stehelin that produced a sarc
probe that met rigorous standards: nearly complete annealing to RSV RNA,
no significant annealing to td-RSV RNA (Fig. lB), and representation of

SARC PROBE DETECTS CONSERVED SEQUENCES IN AVIAN DNA
When Stehelin incubated sarc probe with normal chicken DNA, it annealed
extensively (as, of course, did probe made from td-RSV RNA) (Fig. 1C). The
results, unambiguously exciting, were still fully consistent with the original
oncogene-virogene hypothesis. So we were yet more excited when the next
results seemed to violate it: although the “virogene” probe from td-RSV
annealed poorly to DNAs from several other avian species, the sarc probe
annealed extensively, even to DNA from the Australian emu         a rattite (we

learned, from our Berkeley colleague, Allan Wilson) at a great evolutionary
distance from chickens (23). The extent and fidelity of the hybrids formed
with sarc probe indicated that its homologs in normal cells had diverged
during avian evolution at a rate similar to that of cellular genes used in the
few earlier forays into molecular evolution, suggesting that the sequences
had been conserved for at least 100 million years.
   From these findings, we drew conclusions that seem even bolder in
retrospect, knowing they are correct, than they did at the time (23). We said
that the RSV transforming gene is indeed represented in normal cellular
DNA, but not in the form proposed by the virogene-oncogene hypothesis.
Instead, we argued, the cellular homolog is a normal cellular gene, which
was introduced into a retroviral genome in slightly altered form during the
genesis of RSV. Far from being a noxious element lying in wait for a
carcinogenic signal, the progenitor of the viral oncogene appeared to have a
function valued by organisms, as implied by its conservation during evolu-
tion. Since the viral src gene allows RSV to induce tumors, we speculated
that its cellular homolog normally influenced those processes gone awry in
tumorigenesis, control of cell growth or development.

FIRMING UP THE RESULT: SARC REPRESENTS THE C-SRC
PROTO-ONCOGENE
Despite the broad claims, the first round of experiments with sarc probe left
many worrisome questions unanswered.
    The most pressing question, and one foremost in the minds of our critics,
seems now both essential and mundane: Was the sarc probe actually detect-
ing a functional, protein-encoding homolog of the viral transforming gene
( V - S rc)? or were the still ill-defined genetic and physical maps of the RSV
genome leading us astray? Some support came from geneticists who
mapped a large number of the existing transformation mutations of RSV
within the region of the viral genome lost during formation of td-RSV
deletion mutants (24). More exciting and stronger support came from
protein biochemists: Joan Brugge and Ray Erikson discovered that the
long-sought product of v-src was a protein of about 60,000 daltons (25), one
that would require about 1600 nucleotides of coding sequence and could
account for most of what was missing from td-RSV. Hermann Oppermann
and others (26) then detected a protein in normal cells that seemed virtually
indistinguishable from v-src protein, confirming the idea that sarc probe was
measuring a gene (now called                that resembled V - s r c . Ultimately, the
molecular cloning and nucleotide sequencing of the RSV genome revealed
how fortunate we hade been in the design of our probe (27): Most td-RSV
mutants lack all of v-src and little else.
    The second question was more subtle: Did the conservation of
during avian speciation accurately imply that it was a cellular gene? or might
it still represent an inherited viral gene more conserved than other viral
elements? Answers came from several quarters, all confirming the argu-
ments based on evolution. Using chicken chromosomes fractioned accord-
ing to size by Elton Stubblefield in Texas, we found that              and virogenes
are unlinked; the viral genes we could detect were on one or more large
chromosomes, but              was on a small chromosome (28). Steve Hughes
then used restriction enzymes to gauge the diversity of sequences in and
around viral genes and              in many individual chickens (29); the pattern
generated with sarc probe was monotonous, as would be expected for a
conserved cellular gene (and shown to be the case for genes such as globin,
ovalbumin, and others). The pattern produced with a probe for viral struc-
tural genes, however, suggested variety in number and context, as though
they had been introduced into the chicken genome by recent, independent
germ line infections. When we examined the transcripts emanating from
         and from virus-related genes, individual chicken embryos contained
various amounts and types of viral RNAs but similar quantities of a single,
differently-sized species of           RNA (30). The most powerful evidence for
the cellular nature of             required molecular cloning. For then it was
possible to show that the coding sequences of          were interrupted in many
places by introns (31), in the manner recently discovered to be characteristic
of cellular genes. In contrast, as described in greater detail below, endo-
genous virogenes have the insignia of proviruses, being composed of conti-
nuous coding domains, flanked by repeated sequences.

   The third question was most informative about the mechanism by which
      causes cancer: What accounted for the proposed physological differ-
ences between a beneficial proto-oncogene and a pathogenic viral oncogene
derived from it? From the first measurements of         gene expression, it was
apparent that the viral gene, controlled by a potent viral transcriptional
promoter, was expressed much more vigorously than its cellular counter-
part (32). But the levels of       protein required for transformation proved
to be lower than non-oncogenic amounts of               protein (33), implying
qualitative differences as well. Mark Collett in Erikson’s laboratory (34) and
Art Levinson in ours (35) had discovered that             proteins are protein
kinases, which Tony Hunter and Bart Sefton later showed to be specific for
tyrosine residues (36). Saburo Hanafusa’s laboratory then defined the
subtle structural and physiological differences between the viral and cellular
versions of the gene (37): at least three of several aminoacid differences
between            and          enhance the protein-tyrosine kinase activity of
the transforming protein. Thus, quantitative and qualitative factors conspire to
produce the srconcogene.
   Finally, how well conserved is the cellular        gene? Early on, Deborah
Spector showed that under conditions of reduced stringency most or all the
sarc probe could anneal to the genomes of all vertebrates, not just birds
(38). Since the implicated mammals included man, these findings helped to
create a larger audience for our work, and they raised the possibility that
retroviral proto-oncogenes might have a role on human cancer. New tech-
nologies ultimately extended the list of organisms that carry         to include
virtually all metazoans      insects (39), worms (40) sponges (41), and hydras
(42)    reminders of our evolutionary origins that are at once exhilarating
and sobering.
   The      story remains unfinished. We cannot tell you how            benefits
normal organisms or cells, although recent work implicates               in both
development, especially in the central nervous system (43), and in growth
control during mitosis (44). We do not know the physiological targets for
the      kinase, although numerous phosphotyrosine-containing proteins
have been identified (45). And we do not know how the enzymatic activity of
p60 is regulated, although phosphorylation is important (46). Nevertheless,
the      paradigm has stimulated our field to move in several directions: to
identify many new viral oncogenes and their cellular progenitors (47), to
characterize a stunning variety of oncogenic proteins (48), to make unex-
pected connections with elements of growth regulatory networks (49), and
to describe mutant proto-oncogenes in human tumors (50). These develop-
ments are recounted in the accompanying lecture by Mike Bishop. It is my
mission to stay with the virus      and especially the provirus.

DECIPHERING PROVIRAL STRUCTURE
By the early 1970’s the provirus was a well-accepted idea, but the organiza-
tion of viral DNA and its position within chromosomes were still matters of
conjecture. Several pecularities of viral RNA and the viral life cycle hinted

that proviral DNA must have special attributes (19). First, the priming site
for the first strand of viral DNA was near the 5’ rather than at the 3’ end of
viral RNA (51), implying that synthesis must be a complex process and that
the provirus must not be a simple copy of viral RNA. Next, a short sequence
(R) was found at both ends of viral RNA, and hence present in two copies,
but appeared to be copied only once during synthesis of viral DNA (52);
how was the second copy of R regenerated? Finally, it was difficult to
account for the efficient synthesis of viral RNA without the prospect of a
strong transcriptional promoter upstream of the start site; how was that
promoter provided?
   These problems were solved by the unexpectedly elegant configuration of
viral DNA, as worked out mainly by Peter Shank, Steve Hughes, and
Hsing-Jien Kung in our group (53) and independently by John Taylor’s
laboratory in Philadelphia (54). Once again, RSV was the instrument of
discovery, and again the results depended upon hybridization with specific
probes, this time for terminal regions of the viral genome. In essence, viral
genes were found to be flanked in the provirus by long terminal repeats
 (LTRs) derived from sequences present at both ends of viral RNA (Fig. 2).
 (The ends of the LTRs correspond to the priming sites for the two DNA
strands and thereby helped unravel a strategy of DNA synthesis too
convoluted to review here (19).) Because the R sequence is present once in
each LTR, it can be reconstituted by transcribing parts of both LTRs. And viral

sequences that contain strong transcriptional signals reside upstream of the
RNA start site. Mapping of integration sites showed that many regions of
the host genome could accommodate a provirus; thus, transcriptional self-
sufficiency of the provirus allowed it to function in varied chromosomal
contexts.

PROVIRUSES AS MOBILE ELEMENTS THAT CAUSE INSERTION
MUTATIONS
But the structure of the provirus did more than solve some perplexities of
the retrovirus life cycle. In general form and even in selected short se-
quences, proviruses resemble an abundant type of mobile DNA element
(Fig. 3), described by now in plants, bacteria, yeast, insects, and many
other organisms (55), another arresting example of conservation through-
out evolution. Their connection with retroviruses has been strengthened in
recent years by discoveries that several such elements are duplicated and
relocated by using reverse transcriptases to make new DNA copies from
RNA transcripts (56), although they never produce extracellular viruses.
These properties also apply to most endogenous proviruses, cloned from
the germ lines of many vertebrates (57), reemphasizing the profound differ-
ences between inherited virogenes and cellular proto-oncogenes.
   One practical consequence of the startling similarities between retroviral
proviruses and mobile elements was to consider the possibility that pro-
viruses, like mobile DNA, might cause insertion mutations. In 1978, while

insertion (open triangles). The illustrated mobile elements included retroviral proviruses (RSV
and mouse mammary tumor virus MMTV), retrotransposons of Drosophila (copia and 412) and
budding yeast (Tyl), and a conventional transposon of E.coli (Tn9). (Reprinted with permission

on sabbatical in Mike Fried’s laboratory at the Imperial Cancer Research
Fund, I designed an experiment to test this idea. John Wyke provided me
with a rat cell line transformed by a single RSV provirus, which could serve
as a target for insertion mutation by proviruses introduced by superinfec-
tion with mouse leukemia virus (MLV). By sifting through many clones of
cells that had lost their transformed properties after infection with MLV,
Suzanne Ortiz and I found two that contained an MLV provirus inserted at
different sites within the pre-existing RSV provirus, interfering with the
expression of        (58).
   This experiment established the principle that retroviruses could serve as
insertional mutagens to inactivate genes. It also had the heuristic benefit of
stimulating us to think about insertion mutations that acted in a dominant
fashion by activating gene expression. Greg Payne was then attempting to
explain how avian leukosis virus (ALV), a virus virtually indistinguishable
from td-RSV and lacking any evidence of a viral oncogene, could neverthe-
less induce tumors (most commonly B-cell lymphomas) within several weeks
after infection of susceptible chickens (59). Might ALV proviruses occasion-
ally integrate adjacent to a cellular proto-oncogene and augment expression
through a viral LTR? Greg’s evidence for this idea (60), however provoca-
tive, was nearly drowned out by the commotion caused by Hayward, Neel,
and Astrin’s discovery (61) that ALV DNA in B cell lymphomas was adjacent
to c-myc     a known progenitor of a retroviral oncogene (62)    and that the
viral LTR was driving c-myc expression.
   ALV-induced tumors taught us several new principles: Retroviruses can
induce neoplasia by insertionally activating proto-oncogenes (63); pro-
viruses and their target genes can be variously arranged with similar effects
on transcription (64); and proto-oncogenes do not need to be transduced to
participate in oncogenesis. The last was an especially important point that
presaged the later outpouring of mutant proto-oncogenes in human tumors
unassociated with any virus (50).

USING PROVIRUSES AS TRANSPOSON TAGS FOR NOVEL
PROTO-ONCOGENES: THE INT-1 STORY
However important, ALV has failed to introduce us to any proto-oncogenes
not already known as forefathers of retroviral oncogenes. For this, we made
use of another retrovirus without a viral oncogene, the mouse mammary
tumor virus (MMTV). Like RSV, MMTV has a venerable history (65). Found
in the milk of inbred mice with a high incidence of mammary cancer over
fifty years ago in Holland (66) and at the Jackson Laboratories in Maine
(67), MMTV was the first mammalian retrovirus to be discovered; it remains
the only efficient viral agent of mammary carcinoma, and thus a model for
one of the most common of human cancers.
   MMTV-induced mammary tumors are quasi-clonal growths of virus-in-
fected cells (68). To ask whether the tumor cells result from insertion of
viral DNA near a heretofore unknown proto-oncogene, Roel Nusse exam-
ined many tumors to find one with only a single new provirus; he then

cloned that provirus and its flanking cellular DNA in E.coli. An unfamiliar
gene, which we called int-I, was nearby, and it was expressed in that tumor
and several others with nearby insertions, but not in normal mammary
glands (69).
   But this was not sufficient to implicate int-1 as a oncogene. First there was
the circumstantial force of repetition: over three-quarters of mammary
tumors in the C3H mouse strain harbor insertion mutations in the int-1
locus. Then Tony Brown did what nature had not done, by placing the int-1
gene within a retroviral genome; the resulting virus alters the growth and
morphology of cultured mammary cells (70). Finally, Ann Tsukamoto fol-
lowed a strategy pioneered by Ralph Brinster and Richard Palmiter and by
Philip Leder (71) and introduced the int-1 gene, linked to an MMTV LTR,
into the mouse germ line (72). All the transgenic mice, male or female,
experience dramatic hyperplasia of the mammary epithelium, and most of
the females develop mammary carcinoma within six months. This is about as
close as we can come to fulfilling Koch’s postulates for a genetic disease: by
placing the virally-mutated form of the gene into the germ line        ironically,
much as envisioned to occur naturally in the virogene-oncogene hypothesis
    we have recreated the disease.
   I cannot leave our transgenic mice without making a more general point.
In California and many other places, misguided efforts to abolish the use of
laboratory animals seriously threaten medical science. If Peyton Rous had
been denied his chickens, our field would have no past; if all of us are now
denied mice and other animals, it will have little future.

A TENTATIVE SCHEME FOR TRANSDUCTION OF PROTO-
ONCOGENES
 int-1 is but the first entry on a now substantial list of proto-oncogenes
 discovered as loci repeatedly activated by proviruses in tumors (63). Thus,
retroviruses usher in the genetic cast in the drama of cancer in two ways: by
transduction and insertion mutation. Not surprisingly, the two phenomena
appear to be mechanistically related: insertion mutation is probably the first
step in the sequence of events that occasionally spawns a viral oncogene as
its end product. What we can predict, but not yet fully substantiate by direct
observations, is that two recombination events are required for transduc-
 tion (Fig. 4; 73). The first occurs during proviral integration, placing
viral DNA upstream from the activated cellular gene that will be acquired.
The second occurs during virus replication in the tumor that results from
the insertion mutation; the second step joins viral sequences to cellular
sequences derived from the downstream region of the gene. We suppose
that more or less in this fashion a close relative of ALV acquired a slightly
mutated version of a chicken’s      gene nearly a century ago, and set us on a
path we are still travelling.

THE PROSPECTS FOR RETROVIROLOGY
The story thus far confirms David Baltimore’s statement of thanksgiving


Figure 4. Model for transduction of cellular proto-oncogenes to form retroviral oncogenes.
Exons of a proto-oncogene     are located downstream of a retroviral provirus recently introduced
by infection and denoted as   in Fig. 2. Virushost chimeric RNA, a product of the proviral insertion
mutation, recombines with      normal viral RNA during virus replication to join viral sequences
downstream of the cellular    sequences. For further details, see Ref. 73.




(74): “a virologist is among the luckiest of biologists because he can see into
his chosen pet down to the details of all its molecules.” Because retro-
viruses, our chosen pets, are such remarkable agents, it has been enough to
train our sights on two brief questions    how do retroviruses grow? how do
retroviruses cause cancer?     to have extended our concerns outward to the
cellular host, as well as to have focused them inward upon the viruses
themselves (75). As a result, we have entered into some of the liveliest


518



arenas in modern biology: the genetic basis of cancer, the transposition of
DNA through RNA intermediates, the control of gene expression in eukar-
yotes, and the molecular evidence for evolution.
   At this point, the study of oncogenes and proto-oncogenes has attained a
degree of maturity that allows it to be conducted with astonishing little
virology. Yet retroviruses remain vital tools for the isolation of important
new oncogenes; witness in the past few years the discoveries of the jun and
crk genes (76). Likewise, since the discovery of reverse transcriptase nearly
two decades ago, seemingly exhaustive attention has been given to the life
cycle of retroviruses (19), yet many central features are just now coming
into view (75). Cell surface receptors for viral attachment and entry have
been recently identified and show a remarkable range of biochemical prop-
erties (77); the proviral integration reaction has been recapitulated in vitro
with nucleoprotein complexes (78), allowing a description of integrative
precursors and intermediates (79); retroviruses have been recognized as
pliable genetic vectors (80) that may one day be used clinically to correct
gene deficiencies, in the manner used in nature to transport host-derived
oncogenes; many unexpected aspects of viral gene expression have been
discovered, including translational frameshifting during the synthesis of
reverse transcriptase (81) and complex viral regulatory genes that govern
the behavior of two classes of human retroviruses (82); and the principles of
virus assembly are emerging through physical and genetic assaults on viral
structural proteins and proteases (83). These inherently fascinating prob-
lems have now taken on a special urgency, because we are all threatened by
the world-wide dissemination of a lethal human retrovirus, the human
immunodeficiency virus (84). Thus retroviruses continue to challenge our
intellects in ways that may help us grapple with major diseases, cancer and
now AIDS, while also revealing fundamental features of the lives of our
cells.
