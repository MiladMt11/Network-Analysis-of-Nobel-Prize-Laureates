INTRODUCTION
This presentation and the one to be given immediately thereafter will be
 concerned with the reversible phosphorylation of proteins and the role of
 this process in biological regulation. In addition to discussing our own early
 contributions to this field, Ed Fischer and I will describe some of the
 developments that have occurred subsequently. These developments have
 led to the realization that protein phosphorylation constitutes a major
 mechanism by which cellular processes are controlled. My own remarks will
 review the historical background that provided the setting in which our
joint work was carried out in the 1950s and early 1960s. Then I’ll turn to a
 discussion of this work itself, to be followed by comments on the cyclic
 AMP-dependent protein kinase. Finally I will talk about the intracellular
 transmission of hormone and growth factor signals through protein kinase
 cascades.


BACKGROUND
By 1940, which is the year in which I entered medical school at Washington
University in St Louis, it was well established that the breakdown of glyco-
gen in skeletal muscle and other types of cells occurs by the process of
phosphorolysis, catalyzed by the enzyme phosphorylase (for review, see ref.
1). Carl Cori was Professor and Chairman of the Department of Pharmacol-
ogy at Washington University, when I started my training there, but he was
soon to take over the Department of Biological Chemistry. I gradually came
to know him, at first distantly, the way medical students usually know their
professors, but later on somewhat better after I had become a teaching
assistant in biochemistry. In this latter role I also became acquainted with
Arda Green, who, together with Carl and Gerty Cori, was purifying rabbit
muscle phosphorylase . It was not long until I began to hear about the
unusual properties of this remarkable enzyme, which they had foun d exist-

ed in skeletal muscle in two different forms that they designated a s phos-
phorylase b and phosphorylase a (2,3). The a form was purified and ob-
tained as a crystalline enzyme. Kinetically, it was shown that phosphorylas  e b
required high concentrations of 5’-AMP for activity whereas phosphorylase
a was active in the absence of this nucleotide. Since the concentration of
5’-AMP required for the activity of phosphorylase b was considerably higher
than that found in muscle, this form was considered to be physiologically
inactive. Phosphorylas e a was thought of as the physiologically active spe-
cies. Evidence was obtained that the two forms are interconvertible within
the cell, and it was postulated by the Coris that interconversion of the forms
of phosphorylase constitutes a physiologically significant regulatory mecha-
nism. Resting muscle was reported to contain phosphorylase predominantly
in the a form, whereas electrically stimulated muscle contained th e b form
(4). As will be discussed later (see below) the reverse is actually true.
Regardless of this latter point, however, the finding that an enzyme might
shuttle back and forth between two forms within the cell was a remarkable
advance, which set the stage for important later developments.
   The Coris were unaware of the chemical nature of the interconversion
reactions of phosphorylase, but they did discover an enzyme that would
convert phosphorylas e a to phosphorylas e b in vitro. This enzyme was called
the “PR enzyme” based on th e assumption that it acted by removing a
prosthetic group from phosphorylas e a, which was thought of as a holoen-
zyme form (2); phosphorylase 6, lacking the putative group, was considered
to be the apoenzyme form. Based on the fact that phosphorylas e b could be
activated b y 5’-AMP, this nucleotide bound to the enzyme was thought of as
the likely candidate for the prosthetic group of phosphorylase a. However,
all attempts to identify 5’-AMP as a product formed when phosphorylase a
was converted to phosphorylase b by the PR enzyme were unsuccessfu l (2,3).
Because trypsin treatment of phosphorylase a led to the formation of a
phosphorylase b-like form , i.e. an enzyme that could be activated by
5’-AMP (3), it was believed that the PR enzyme might be a protease. No
enzyme that could convert phosphorylas e b to a in vitro in the presence of
5’AMP, or under any other condition that these workers tried, could be
demonstrated. This did not seem unreasonable, however, if it were sup-
posed that such a conversion might require            peptide bond biosynthesis,
because at that time the likelihood that such a reaction could be shown to
occur in vitro was considered unlikely. These early concepts with respect to
the interconversion reactions of phosphorylase are illustrated in Fig. 1.
   Although as a medical student I heard about the research o n phosphory-
lase, particularly as a result of my friendship with Arda Green, my first
 “hands on” experience with this enzyme came after World War II had
ended, when I started postdoctoral work in the Coris’ laboratory (My
 residency training in internal medicine had been interrupted by the war,
 and, although at that time I expected to return to clinical medicine in due
 course, I had decided to work in a basic science department for a year or
 two before resuming hospital-based training.) The problem that was given

to me by the Coris involved solubility measurements on phosphorylase, and
I also studied the effect of protamine and polylysine on the two forms of the
enzyme. It was of interest that in the presence of these polyanionic sub-
stances, inosinic acid, as well o n 5’-AMP, was very effective as an activator of
phosphorylase b. All of these studies on the effects of nucleotides on
phosphorylase were carried out before the revelations of Jacob and Monod
concerning allosterism and protein conformation and at that time were
viewed simply as unexplained phenomenology. Indeed for several years
Carl Cori advised against my publishing these findings unless I could
explain them. Eventually, after Neil Madsen found that protamine could
physically bind to phosphorylase, which was at least a step in the direction of
how it might affect the activity of the enzyme, Cori let me send in my paper.
   Although, as I have pointed out, knowledge with respect to the properties
of phosphorylase as an enzyme increased significantly during th e 1940s, it
was often difficult to explain their physiological importance. This can be
understood if one considers what was known about glycogen metabolism at
that time. The epochal work of Leloir on the mechanism of glycogen
synthesis was still to come, i.e. the role of UDG in polysaccharide synthesis
and the existence of the enzyme, glycogen synthase, were completely un-
known. Hence, it was believed that phosphorylase was involved in glycogen
synthesis as well as in glycogenolysis (Fig. 2). It was assumed that the
direction of the phosphorylase reaction would be determined by the con-
centrations of the components of the reaction, particularly by the concen-
tration of inorganic phosphate. This situation obviously made it difficult to
interpret findings relating to the interconversion reactions o f phosphory-

forms a and b, but the chemical nature of the interconversion reaction was unknown. Conversion

lase b and a. Nonetheless, in the late 1940s and the early 1950’s a clear story
was beginning to emerge with respect to the action of the glycogenolytic
hormones, glucagon, and epinephrine and their effects on interconversion
of the forms phosphorylase as studied in liver cells. Earl Sutherland, work-
ing initially in the Coris’ laboratory and later independently at Western
Reserve University, found that epinephrine and glucagon caused the rapid
conversion of liver phosphorylase a to phosphorylas e b (5), and it was also
shown that epinephrine caused the same change in the muscle diaphragm
(6). Inasmuch as epinephrine and glucagon were known to b e glycogenoly-
tic hormones, Sutherland’s findings clearly supported the concept that the
activation of phosphorylase is associated with glycogen degradation. Why
then, should electrical stimulation and muscle contraction, which were also
known to result in glycogenolysis, be associated with the conversion of
phosphorylase a to the inactive form, phosphorylase b (4).

CONVERSION OF RABBIT SKELETAL MUSCLE PHOSPHORYLAS                            E b
TO PHOSPHORYLASE a IN VITRO
In Fall 1953, Ed Fischer joined the Department of Biochemistry at the
University of Washington , where I was already a faculty member. As a
graduate student in Geneva, Ed had worked on potato phosphorylase, and
we thus shared a common interest in this particular enzyme. We discussed
some of the puzzling features of phosphorylase and were particularly intri-
gued by the still unsolved nature of th e 5’-AMP effect, i.e. how 5’AMP
activates phosphorylas e b but is seemingly unnecessary for phosphorylase a.
It seemed worthwhile, purely as a secondary undertaking for each of us,
since we both had problems that we considered as our major areas of
concentration, to pool our efforts to see whether or not we could obtain
information on this point. The initial experiment that we undertook togeth-
er was simply to prepare pure crystalline phosphorylase a by the Coris’
procedure (7). However , our initial attempts to do this were woefully
unsuccessful. The enzyme would not crystallize, a step that was essential in
order to obtain pure protein. More puzzling was the fact that the partially
pure enzyme, which we did obtain, was always in th e b form rather than the
a form. Insofar as we could determine we had followed the Coris’ proce-
dure exactly except that we had clarified the original muscle extract by
centrifugation rather than by filtration through paper. Although this
seemed like a trivial change, we nonetheless included the filtration step in
our next preparation. To our surprise, this time we obtained phosphorylase
a, which crystallized readily as it was supposed to do. Two conclusions could
be drawn that would explain these results. First, “resting” rabbit muscle
extracts must contain phosphorylase predominantly in th e b form rather
than the a form as had been postulated by the Cori          s (4,8), and second,
filtration of muscle extracts through paper must trigger conversion of
phosphorylase b to a in vitro (9). Subsequently we found that thorough
washing of the filter paper before use eliminated conversion            of b to a,
implying that some component in the paper must have been extracted to
account for the effect. It was also found that this conversion failed to occur
if the muscle extract were aged prior to filtration. The critical component
from the filter paper that was required in th e b to a step was shown to be
calcium, and the essential component in the extract that was lost on aging
was found to be ATP.
   Armed with the knowledge that there is an ATP requirement for conver-
sion of phosphorylas e b to phosphorylase a, we thought it likely that we were
dealing with a phosphotransferase reaction in which the termina           l phos-
phoryl group of ATP was being transferred either to the protein itself or
possibly to a nonprotein component bound to the enzyme. It soon became
apparent that a “converting enzyme” , which could be separated from
phosphorylase b, was required in the reaction (10). After it had been
determined that ADP, as well as phosphorylase a were products of the
reaction (1 l), we spoke of this enzyme as phosphorylase b kinase, or simply

phosphorylase kinase, rather than converting enzyme (11). The nature of
the Ca2+ requirement for the b to a reaction was not apparent immediately,
but eventually it was determined by one of our graduate students, William
L. Meyer, that the effect of this metal was two-fold. On the one han d Ca2+
was needed for the activation of a kinase activating factor, (RAF), but in
addition it was also required for the activity of phosphorylase kinase itself
(12). RAF was later shown to be      a Ca2+-dependent protease by another
student, R. Bruce Huston (13). (The current name for thi        s protease is
calpain.) We determined the stoichiometry of the phosphoryla se b to phos-
phorylase a reaction (11) and also obtained the amino acid sequence sur-
rounding the phosphorylated serine in phosphorylase a (14). It was demon-
strated that inorganic phosphate is released in the muscle phosphorylase a
to b reaction catalyzed by the PR enzyme, which could now be termed
phosphorylase phosphatase. Thus, by the lat e 1950’s, it was possible to write
specific equations for the interconversion reactions of muscl e phosphory-
lase as follows:

   During the same period that our work on the muscle phosphorylase
system was being carried out, very similar studies relating to live  r phosphor-
ylase were being conducted independently in the laboratory of Earl Suther-
land at Western Reserve University. Sutherland’s major coworkers in this
effort were Walter D. Wosilait and Theodore W. Rall. In an early study (15)
these investigators obtained evidence that inorganic phosphate was released
when partially purified active liver phosphorylase was incubated with what
they referred to as inactivating enzyme, and they also determined that
phosphate was incorporated into phosphorylase when liver slices were
incubated in the presence o f 32P-phosphate. Later they showed that both of
the interconversion reactions of liver phosphorylase could be demonstrated
in cell free system s (16,17). A monumental “ancillary finding” that grew out
of the work on liver phosphorylase by the Sutherland laboratory was, of
course, the discovery of cyclic AMP, the first identified “second messenger”
of hormone action (18).
   It is of interest to consider whether there had been any indications that
the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins might be of regula-
tory significance prior to elucidation of the muscle and liver phosphorylase

systems. The existence of phosphoproteins had, of course, been known for
many years before 1950. Phosphoproteins were classified as “conjugated
proteins” and for the most part consisted of proteins of nutritional signifi-
cance associated with the feeding of the young, e.g     . casein of milk and
several phosphoproteins found in egg yolk. Interestingly, it was also appre-
ciated that pepsinogen contained one mole of firmly bound phosphate per
mole of enzyme, but the significance of this wasn’t (and still isn’t) known. It
was also known that nonspecific phosphatases could catalyze the release of
phosphate from phosphoproteins. In an important study that was carried
out at about the same time as the work on phosphorylase was underway,
Burnett and Kennedy described an enzyme that catalyzed th e phosphoryla-
tion of casein (19). These workers were aware of the high rate of turnover of
phosphate in proteins and were the first to describe a protein kinase. In
general, however, a realization that protein phosphorylation- dephosphory-
lation is a dynamic process affecting enzymes and important in the control
of metabolism had not bee n forseen.


PROTEIN PHOSPHORYLATION AND THE TRANSMISSION
OF EXTRACELLULAR SIGNALS
As we have seen, an interest in the mechanisms of action of epinephrine and
glucagon had an important part in work on the interconversion reactions of
phosphorylase (5,6) which in turn led to discovery of the dynamic           phos-
phorylation and dephosphorylation of proteins. Going back even further,
however, it can be noted that the original studies of the Coris, which led to
the finding of phosphorylase itself, grew out of the longstanding interest of
these investigators on the role of epinephrine in the regulation of glycogen
metabolism (20). That an interest in hormone action would contribute
importantly to the development of the field of protein phosphorylation-
dephosphorylation was no accident, since we now know that one of the
major functions of protein phosphorylation as a regulatory process is in the
transmission of signals that impinge on cells. This is true not only with
respect to the transduction of hormone and growth factor signals but for
other types of stimuli as well. For example, as mentioned earlier, electrical
stimulation of muscle leads to changes in protein phosphorylation within
the cell. It is probably more than coincidental that the extent of protein
phosphorylation is much greater in eukaryotic cells than it is prokaryotes,
particularly in eukaryotic cells of higher animals that are subject to complex
forms of external regulation.
   It was apparent very early that the relative amounts of phosphorylase b
and a that would be present within the cell at any particularly time would
depend on the relative rates of the phosphorylase kinase and phosphatase
reactions, and it was anticipated that one or both of these enzymes must be
subject to regulation. Furthermore, two factors capable of influencing the
balance between the two forms of phosphorylase had been found. As noted,
these were calcium ions, identified as the metal ion that caused phosphory-

lase a formation in muscle extracts (9) and cyclic AMP, which promoted
phosphorylase a formation in liver cells and homogenates (reviewed in ref.
21). We subsequently showed that cyclic AMP would also cause phosphory-
lase a formation in muscle extracts (22). In the muscle system it was
determined that the effects of Ca2+ and cyclic AMP in stimulating phos-
phorylase activation in vitro were a result of phosphorylase kinase activation
rather than phosphorylase phosphatase inhibition (11).
   The coupling of muscle contraction to glycogenolysis: The finding that the
major form of phosphorylase present in resting muscle is phosphorylas e b
(8) rather than phosphorylase a (4,7), together with a realization that
phosphorylase b can be converted to phosphorylas e a if Ca2+ is introduced
into muscle extracts containing AT P (9), made it possible to arrive at a
rational position with respect to the effect of electrical stimulation on
phosphorylase. In 1956 (23) Cori was able to demonstrate that muscle
contraction causes conversion of phosphorylas e b to a, rather than the other
way around; this was in keeping with the known effect of contraction on
glycogen breakdown. The effect of Ca2+ on the activation of phosphorylase
kinase now fits well into a scheme (Fig. 3) whereby this metal, acting as a
messenger substance associated with muscle contraction, could be responsi-
ble for the coupling of glycogenolysis (an energy-yielding process) to con-
traction (an energy-utilizing process). Of the two different mechanisms by
which Ca 2+ could regulate phosphorylase kinase, i.e. through limited pro-
teolysis involving KAF, or as a result of the requirement of phosphorylase
kinase for Ca2+ per se (12), only the latter was considered to be physiologi-
cally significant. The work of Ozaw a et al. (24), who quantified the effect of
Ca 2+ on the phosphorylase kinase reaction, was critical with respect to our
understanding of this process. Many years later the actual mechanism by

potential usefulness of a cascade device (amplification of the signal, provi-
sion of branch points etc.) very few other examples have been reported.
Recently, however, a complicated multi-step protein kinase cascade related
to the action of numerous growth factors has been detected; this will be
discussed at the end of this lecture.
  The cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase has served as a prototype for
studies on protein kinases in general. This kinase is made up of regulatory
(R) and catalytic (C) subunits and has the general structure , R2C2. In the
next lecture Ed Fischer will speak about the mechanism by which cyclic
AMP regulates the activity of the kinase. The catalytic subunit of this
enzyme was the first protein kinase for which the complete amino acid
sequence was determine d (31), and it was also the first protein kinase to
have had its X-ray crystallographic structure elucidated (32). The cyclic
AMP-dependent protein kinase also played a very significant part in our
understanding of protein kinase specificity, which has become increasingly
important as the number of known kinases has sky rocketed. Although it will
not be possible to do more than touch on this latter topic here, it can be
noted that the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase was the first kinase for
which a “consensus” phosphorylation site sequence was clearly recognized
(33-37). This sequence, Arg-Arg-X-Ser-X, is found in many, but not all,

substrates for the cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. In connection with
the specificty studies that were carried out within my own laboratory, I
would like to call particular attention to the work of David B . Bylund and
Bruce E. Kemp.
   A protein serine/threonine kinase cascade activated in response to insulin and
related growth factors: One of the enduring problems in endocrinology has
been the question of the mechanism of action of insulin. Indeed, investiga-
tors have been interested in this area for decades, and over the years
information on this subject gradually accumulated through the application
of whatever tools became available. At first, experiments were carried out
with intact animals, later with perfused organs, eventually with isolated
tissues such as the muscle diaphragm, and finally with cells in culture. Until
comparatively recently it had not been possible, however, to demonstrate a
meaningful insulin response in homogenates or other types of cell-free
system. Approximately ten years ago, however, it was found that the EGF
receptor is a protein tyrosine kinase, and shortly after that it was deter-
mined that this is also true for the insulin recepto r (38,39). Now it is known
that eight or nine different growth factor receptors are protein tyrosine
kinases. These findings ushered in a new era of research with respect to
insulin and related hormones or growth factors. However, although most
workers in the field felt that it would now be a simple matter to identify
meaningful substrates for thes e receptor/kinases, and to elucidate the
complete intracellular signal transduction pathway involved, this did not
occur. Several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins were found in cells treated
with insulin or the other growth factors, but none of these proteins could at
first be readily connected with the known cellular actions of the growth
factors involved. Nonetheless, it was clearly demonstrated that the protein
tyrosine kinase activity of these receptors was essential for their action, and
there was little if any doubt that initiation of their signals must involve
ligand-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation.
   An investigator who is interested in determining the steps of a signal
transduction pathway can either wor k “downstream” from a receptor in
order to identify components of the pathway, or he can work “upstream”
toward the receptor starting with a well established cellular effect of the
growth factor in question. A number of laboratories, including my own,
which are interested in signaling from the insulin or related receptors, have
used the latter strategy in their approach. The particular cellular effect that
these groups have chosen as their starting point has been the activation of
protein serine and threonine kinases, which results from the simulation of
tyrosine kinases. It has long been known that the stimulation of protein
tyrosine kinases in cells results in changes in serine/threonine phosphoryla-
tion as well as in changes in tyrosine phosphorylation, but the mechanism
involved in the coupling of the two types of protein phosphorylation has
been unknown (40).
   One of the cellular proteins that is readily phosphorylated on serine
residues in response to the stimulation of receptors having protein tyrosine

kinase activity is ribosomal protein S6, although the role of this phosphory-
lation insofar as the regulation of protein synthesis is not clear. This
phenomenon had been discovered a number of years ago, prior to the
involvement of my own laboratory in the problem, and a good start had
already been made in identifying components involved in regulating S6
phosphorylation. For example, it had been shown that in adipocytes or
Swiss 3T3 cells stimulated by insulin an S6 kinase becomes activated (41,42)
and there was good evidence that the activation was due to covalent modifi-
cation, i.e. phosphorylation. It was determined that the protei        n serine/
threonine phosphatases would inactivate the activate d (43,44). Maller and
coworkers had shown that an S6 Kinase (S6 Kinase II), purified to homo-
geneity from Xenopus laevis eggs, could also be inactivated by protein
phosphatases (45) . I mportantly, this latter S6 kinase could be reactivated by
a different protein serine/threonine kinase, microtubule-associated protein
2 kinase (MAP kinase), which was known to be stimulated by insulin treat-
ment of 3T3 L1 cells (46). These results strongly suggested the existence of a
protein serine/threonine kinase cascade in which one growth factor-activat-
ed protein kinase phosphorylated and activated a second protein kinase.
Gregory el al. (47) confirmed these findings using a phosphatase-treated S6
kinase from rabbit liver and MAP kinase from insulin-stimulated Rat 1
HIRc B cells. Then in this laboratory we showed that an EGF          or insulin-
stimulated MAP kinase from Swis s 3T3 cells could phosphorylate and
activate an S6 kinase obtained from this same cell type (48). MAP kinase, in
its active form, appeared to have been activated as a result o f serine/threo-
nine phosphotylation, since it could be inactivated by protein phosphatase
2A. This suggested the existence of even a third protein serine/threonine
kinase in this growth factor-stimulated process.
   A finding of major significance from Sturgill’s laboratory was the fact that
MAP kinase in its active form contains phosphotyrosine as well a s phos-
phothreonine, and that in addition to being inactivated by protein phospha-
tase 2A, it can also be inactivated by CD45, a protein tyrosine phosphatase
(49). These investigators went on to show that phosphorylation of MAP
kinase on tyrosine and threonine is essential for its activity, and it seemed
likely that two different types of protein kinase, i.e. a protei n serine/threo-
nine kinase and a protein tyrosine kinase, would be involved as upstream
components involved in its activation. There was no evidence, however, that
a receptor-type protein tyrosine kinase could serve as either one of these
kinases. It was thus of great interest to search for an enzyme or enzymes,
 MAP kinase kinases, that would catalyze MAP kinase phosphorylation and
 activation.
    In this laboratory Natalie Ahn et al. (50) discovered two separable activa-
 ting factors from Swiss 3T3 cells that catalyzed the activation of an inactive
form of MAP kinase in vitro. Each of these factors required the presence of
 MgATP in order to bring about activation of MAP kinase, and it did not
 matter whether the latter had first been inactivated by a protei       n serine/
 threonine phosphatase or by a protein tyrosine phosphatase. This made it

appear probable that the factors wer e “dual specificity” kinases capable of
phosphorylating proteins or serine and threonine residues as well a s tyro-
sine residues. The existence of dual specificity had, in fact, been found in
yeast. At first we hesitated to call the activating factors “MAP kinase
kinases”, because in work carried out by Rony Seger           et al. (51) we had
determined that MAP kinase can undergo a slow but distinc             t autophos-
phorylation reaction, i.e. that it can catalyze its own phosphorylation, and
that in this reaction threonine and tyrosine residues are phosphorylated.
Moreover, autophosphorylation resulted in activation of the kinase. This
result made it appear possible that a MAP kinase kinase as such might be
unnecessary and that the next upstream component could be a protein
factor that simulated autophosphorylation. Eventually it was shown, howev-
er, that the MAP kinase activating factors were, in fact, protein kinases
capable of phosphorylating a mutant form of MAP kinase that lacked
enzymic activit y (52,53). Moreover, amino acid sequence data obtained in
our laboratory and elsewhere, showed that the activating factors contain
protein kinase amino acid sequence motifs. Later, similar “activators”, i.e.
MAP kinase kinases, were found in PC1 2 cell stimulated by nerve growth
factor or bradykinin (54,55). Gomez and Cohen showed that activated MAP
kinase kinase could be inactivated by a protein serine/threonine phospha-

tase but was not affected by protein tyrosine phosphatases (54). This latter
result indicated that an additional upstream protein serine/threonin e kin-
ase, i.e. a MAP kinase kinase kinase, was probably a component of the
pathway. The present status of the MAP kinase cascade, without the puta-
tive MAP kinase kinase kinase, is shown in Fig. 5.
   Intense effort on the part of many different laboratories is currently
centered on the question of the identity of MAP kinase kinase kinase and
the mechanism by which such an enzyme might be regulated. It was report-
ed by Kyriakis et al. that Raf-1 activates MAP kinase kinase and thus might
itself be a candidate for the kinase kinase kinase (56). This result was
confirmed by Dent et al. (57). Other studies have implicated the possibility
that cdc2 might be an upstream component of the MAP kinase cascade but
not an immediate kinase kinase kinase itself (58). Finally, there is consider-
able evidence that p21 ras is a component acting at some site between the
receptor and the components of the cascade as currently identified (59-
62). A somewhat neglected area of study with respect to the MAP kinase
cascade relates to the question of its precise function and the reasons for
the existence of such a complicated scheme. It is probable that numerous
substrates may exist for each of the protein kinases in the cascade, and in
this connection it is noteworthy that a number of transcription factors
appear to be targeted by MAP kinase and by the S6 kinase. The different
kinases may also have specific metabolic enzyme targets that have not as yet
been identified. Finally, some of the kinases may branch off and regulate
still other kinases (63).


CONCLUSION
In this talk I have reviewed the early work on the interconversion reactions
of the two forms of glycogen phosphorylase and phosphorylase kinase. A
third enzyme that played an important part in early work on protein
phosphorylation-dephosphorylation was glycogen synthase. Much of the
original research on that enzyme was carried out by Joseph Larner and his
associates during the early 1960s. These investigators found that, in con-
trast to the effect of phosphorylation on phosphorylase and phosphorylase
kinase, phosphorylation caused a decrease in the activity of the synthase.
Because the “field” of protein phosphorylation during the first ten years
was dominated by those interested in glycogen metabolism, some even
expressed the idea that perhaps regulation of enzymes by phosphorylation-
dephosphorylation might be restricted to this area. However, the finding of
a multifunctional cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, which was almost
immediately shown by Kuo and Greengard (64) to be very widespread in
nature, served to change this concept. Another important finding that
dispelled the idea that protein phosphorylation was very limited in scope
was the report that pyruvate dehydrogenase is regulated by phosphorylation
(65). As can be noted in Fig. 6, the number of enzymes reported to undergo
regulation as a result of this being phosphorylated started growin g precipi-
