Around 1970, the fundamental signal mechanisms for communication be-
tween cells of the nervous system were known. Hodgkin & Huxley (1952)
had provided the basis for understanding the nerve action potential. The
concept of chemical transmission at synapses had received its experimental
verification by detailed studies on excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic
potentials (see B. Katz, 1966, for a concise description of the electrical
signals in nerve and muscle). The question of the molecular mechanisms
underlying these signals was still open, however. Hodgkin & Huxley (1952)
used the concept of voltage-operated gates for a formal description of
conductance changes, and by 1970 the terms Na-channel and K-channel
were used frequently (see review by Hille, 1970), although no direct evi-
dence for the existence of channels was available from biological prepara-
tions. This was different for the case of artificial membranes. Müller &
Rudin (1963) introduced ‘black-lipid membranes’ as experimental model
systems, which in many respects resemble the bimolecular lipid membrane
of living cells. These membranes are rather good insulators. However, when
they are doped with certain antibiotics or proteins they become electrically
conductive. R.C. Bean et al. (1969) and Hladky & Haydon (1970) showed
that some of these dopants induce discrete, steplike changes in conductance
when they are added in trace amounts . All the evidence suggested that the
conductance changes observed represented the insertion of single pore-like
structures into the membranes.
   In biological membranes similar measurements were not possible at the
time, since the methods available for recording currents in living cells
typically had background noise levels higher, by about a factor of a hun-
dred, than the ‘single-channel currents’ observed in bilayers (see Fig. 1).
Indirect methods, however, provided strong evidence that channels similar
in conductance to those in artificial membranes should be operative in
nerve and muscle cells. Early attempts to count the number of Na channels
by Tetrodotoxin binding indicated that the contribution of a single channel
to Na conductance might be as much as 500 pS. Later, the technique of
noise analysis (Katz & Miledi, 1972; Neher & Stevens, 1977) provided more

accurate numbers. Anderson & Stevens (1973) estimated the conductance
contribution of single Acetylcholine-activated channels (ACh-channels) at
the frog neuromuscular junction to be 32 pS. This is close to the conduc-
tance of single gramicidin channels as measured by Hladky and Haydon.
Thus, it was very tempting to think about better methods for recording
currents from biological preparations. There was good reason to hope that
an improved technology would reveal a whole ‘microcosmos’ of electrical
signals in a multitude of electrically and chemically excitable cell types. In
this lecture I will give a short account of our joint effort to solve this
problem, and then focus on further developments that the solution of the
problem led to. Bert Sakmann, in the second lecture, will present some of
the detailed knowledge that high-resolution current recording provides
access to.


RATIONALE FOR USING ‘PATCH PIPEITES’
A basic limitation for any current measurement, disregarding instrumenta-
tion noise, is the ‘Johnson’ or thermal noise of the signal source, which for a
simple resistor is given by




where σn is the root-mean-square deviation of the current, k is the Boltz-
mann constant, T the absolute temperature, Af the measurement band-
width, and R the resistance. From this it is clear, that the internal resistance
of a signal source (or, more generally, the complex impedance) should be
very high for low-noise current recording. Specifically, to record a current
of 1 pA at a bandwidth of 1 kHz with 10 % accuracy, the internal resistance
of the signal source should be about 2 GΩ or higher. We now know that the
input resistances of small cells can be as high as that. But early in the 1970s
the conventional microelectrode techniques required large cells for reliable
current measurements, and these typically had input resistances in the
range 10 0 kΩ to 50 MΩ. Thus, it seemed impossible to reach the required
resolution with standard techniques and standard preparations. What was
required, was a smaller signal source.
  With these considerations in mind, we directed our efforts to isolate a
small patch of membrane for the purpose of the electrical measurement. I
had gained experience with suction pipettes being placed onto the surface
of cells for local current measurement in the laboratory of H.D. Lux in
Munich, where I did my doctoral thesis. Such pipettes had been used before
in various contexts for either stimulation of cells or for current measure-
ments (Pratt & Eisenberger 1919; Strickholm 1961; Frank & Tauc 1963;
Neher & Lux 1969; Fishman 1973). It was clear to us, that they should be
good tools for single-channel measurements, if only the ‘pipette-to-mem-
brane seal’ could be made good enough. The impedance of the patch itself
should be higher than required, even for a patch as large as 10 µm in

diameter. An incomplete seal, however, is ‘seen’ by the measuring amplifier
in parallel to the patch, and its noise is superimposed onto the patch signal.


EARLY SINGLE-CHANNEL MEASUREMENTS
When Bert Sakmann and I started measurements by placing pipettes onto
the surface of denervated muscle fibres, we soon realized that it was not so
easy to obtain a satisfactory ‘seal’. Although Bert Sakmann was very exper-
ienced in enzymatically treating cell surfaces through his work in B. Katz’s
laboratory, and although the work of Katz & Miledi (1972) and our own
voltage-clamp measurements had shown that denervated muscle should
have an appropriate density of diffusely dispersed ACh-channels, our initial
attempts failed. Our seal resistances were just about 10-20 MΩ, two
orders of magnitude lower than desired. However, by reducing the pipette
size, and by optimizing its shape we slowly arrived at a point where signals
emerged from the background - first some characteristic noise, later on
blips which resembled square pulses, as expected. In 1976, we published
records (Neher & Sakmann, 1976) which, with good confidence, could be
interpreted as single-channel currents (see Fig. 2). The fact that similar
records could be obtained both in our Göttingen laboratory and in the
laboratory of Charles F. Stevens at Yale, (where I spent parts of 1975 and
1976), gave us confidence that they were not the result of some local
demon, but rather signals of biological significance. The square-wave na-
ture of the signals was proof of the hypothesis that channels in biological
membranes open and close stochastically in an all-or-none manner. For the
first time one could watch conformational changes of biological macromo-
lecules in situ and in real time. However, the measurement was far from
perfect. There still was excessive background noise, concealing small and
more short-lived contributions of other channel types. Besides, the ampli-

mV, and 40 mV depolarizing pulses are given.

tudes of single-channel currents had a wide distribution, since the majority
of channels were located under the rim of the pipette, such that their
current contributions were recorded only partially.
   We made many systematic attempts to overcome the seal problem (mani-
 pulating and cleaning cell surfaces, coating pipette surfaces, reversing
charges on the glass surface, etc.) with little success. Nevertheless, some
important properties of single channels could be elucidated in the years
1975 to 1980 (Neher & Steinbach 1978; Sakmann 1978; Sakmann & Bo-
heim 1978; Conti & Neher 1980; Sakmann, Patlak & Neher 1980).
   By about 1980, we had almost given up on attempts to improve the seal,
when we noticed by chance, that the seal suddenly increased by more than
two orders of magnitude when slight suction was applied to the pipette. The
resulting seal was in the gigaohm range, the so-called ‘Gigaseal’. It turned
out that a gigaseal could be obtained reproducibly when suction was com-
bined with some simple measures to provide for clean surfaces, such as
using a fresh pipette for each approach and using filtered solutions. The
improved seal resulted in much improved background noise (Hamill et al.
1981). Fortunately, Fred Sigworth had just joined the laboratory. With his
experience in engineering he improved the electronic amplifiers to match
the advances in recording conditions. Thus, several types of ion channels
could rapidly be characterized at good amplitude and time resolution
(Fig. 3).


UNEXPECTED BENEFITS
Solving the seal problem turned out not only to improve the electrical
recording, but also to provide useful tools for manipulating patches and
small cells. Although the physical nature of the ‘Gigaseal’ is still unknown,
we soon realized that it provides not only electrical stability but also a tight
mechanical connection between the measuring glass pipette and the mem-
brane. Owen Hamill and Bert Sakmann (1981), simultaneously with Horn &
Patlak (1980), found that patches could be removed from cells, by simply
withdrawing the pipette. This results in ‘excised patches’, which are accessi-
ble for solution changes from both sides. Alternatively, a patch can be
ruptured by a short pulse of suction or voltage without loss of the glass-to-
membrane seal. Thus, an electrical connection is established between mea-
suring pipette and cell, with the pipette-cell assembly well insulated against
the outside bath. This configuration was termed ‘whole-cell recording’. Fig.
4 gives a schematic representation of the different procedures and resulting
configurations.
  Whole-cell recording is very similar to conventional microelectrode im-
palement, with some important differences, however:
1. The leak between cell interior and bath is extremely small, such that this
form of penetration is tolerated by cells as small as red blood cells (Hamill
1983).

feedback circuits and additional electrodes, if small cells are used (mem-
brane resistance 100 MW-10 GW).
3. There is rapid diffusional exchange and equilibration between patch
pipette and cell (Marty & Neher 1983; Pusch & Neher 1988). This provides
control over the composition of the medium inside the cell. A cell can easily
be loaded with ions, chelators, second messengers, fluorescent probes, etc.,
simply by including these substances in the measuring pipette. However,
this exchange also implies that the internal milieu is disturbed, and that
signaling cascades may be disrupted (see below).
   With these properties, ‘whole-cell recording’ evolved to be the method of
choice for recording from most cell-culture preparations and from acutely
dissociated tissues. Many cell types, particularly small cells of mammalian
origin, became accessible to biophysical analysis for the first time through
whole-cell recording, since they would not tolerate multiple conventional
impalements. Individual current types could be separated through control
of solution composition on both sides of the membrane (Fenwick et al.
1982b; see Fig. 5 for an example of whole-cell Ca-channel currents). This
development shifted the emphasis of electrophysiological studies away from
large-celled preparations, which usually were of invertebrate origin, to-
wards mammalian and human cell types. In the first half of 1981, just
before we first published a whole-cell characterization of a small mamma-
lian cell (bovine adrenal chromaffin cells) only 5 out of 14 voltage-clamp
studies in the Journal of Physiology were performed on cells of mammalian
origin. The first 199 1 issue of the same journal alone contained 10 voltage-
clamp studies on mammalian cells, none on invertebrates, and all using
either the whole-cell or single-channel recording techniques


DISTURBING SECOND MESSENGER EQUILIBRIA
All measurement techniques have to deal with a conflict with respect to
their objectives. In some instances, it is desired to observe a process,
disturbing it as little as possible; in other instances one would like to obtain
quantitative data under as much experimental control as possible. The two
aims are, of course, mutually exclusive. The cell-attached measurement
comes close to the first ideal, since it leaves the cell largely intact, and allows
one to observe channels open and close, or to record action potentials
extracellularly (Fenwick et al. 1982a). Excised patches constitute the other
extreme, where membrane patches are removed from their natural environ-
ment for optimal control of solution composition on both sides of the
membrane. The whole-cell recording method is at an intermediate position
in this respect. It does provide excellent control over membrane potential,
if cells smaller than 20 mm in diameter are used. However, the chemical
composition of the internal medium is neither undisturbed, nor is it under
good control. We found that small mobile ions typically exchange by diffu-
sion between pipette and cell in a few seconds (for cells of approximately 15
mm diameter and pipettes of 2-5 MW resistance). Molecules of intermedi-

ate size, like second messengers, typically ‘wash-out’ or ‘load’ into cells
within 10 seconds to a minute, and small regulatory proteins may take
several minutes and longer for complete equilibrium (Pusch & Neher 1988).
   In retrospect, it seems fortunate, that we started our measurements with
ACh channels and Na channels, which happen to be relatively robust with
regard to diffusible regulatory components. Thus, we initially avoided com-
plications of ‘channel modulation’. However, when switching to channels
which now are known to be subject to modulation by second messengers, G-
proteins and phosphorylation (such as Ca-channels), we soon realized that
channel activity would disappear rapidly as a result of the perturbation
imposed by the measurement, both in ‘whole-cell’ and, more so, in excised-
patch measurements (Fenwick et al. 1982b). Such ‘washout’ had been
observed earlier in studies on dialyzed giant neurones (Kostyuk 1980). The
prototype of a channel modulated by an intracellular second messenger, the
Ca-activated K+-channel was characterized by Alain Marty (1981). These
early studies already showed the ambivalent nature of the new tools: On the
one hand there was the advantage of control over intracellular calcium to
elucidate the mechanism of Ca-modulation. On the other hand there was
the loss of cellular function due to the loss of regulators, which at that time
were unknown. Subsequently, ingenious use of these tools by many labora-
tories has revealed a whole network of interactions between channels,
second messengers, G-proteins, and other regulatory proteins (see Hille
1989, for review). In order to uncover this network it was necessary not only
to record electrically from cells, but also to control or change systematically
the concentrations of second messengers (Marty 1981; Kameyama et al.
1986; Penner, Matthews & Neher 1988; Fesenko et al. 1985). Later on it
became possible to impose step-like changes in regulators using caged
compounds (Morad et al. 1988), or to load cells with fluorescent indicator
dyes (Almers & Neher 1985) and regulatory proteins (Hescheler et al.
1986).
  All this was made possible by utilizing diffusional exchange between patch
pipette and cell or by exposing the cytoplasmic surface of excised patches.
Later, ways were found to avoid the adverse effects of ‘washout’ by making
the patch selectively permeable to small ions (Lindau & Fernandez 1986;
Horn & Marty 1988). This technique, at present, seems to be the least
invasive method to study the functioning of small cells.


AN ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL APPROACH TO STUDY SECRETION
An outstanding property of an electrical measurement with giga-sealed
pipettes is its high sensitivity. This can be used not only to record currents,
but also to study the membrane electrical capacitance, which is a measure of
cell surface area. It had been observed before, that membrane capacitance
increases under conditions where massive exocytosis of secretory vesicles is
expected to occur. Presumably, this is due to the incorporation of vesicular
membrane into the plasma membrane (Jaffe et al. 1978; Gillespie 1979).


20                                Physiology or Medicine 1991


The low background noise of the giga-seal measurement made it possible to
resolve area changes which result from the exocytotic fusion of single
vesicles. This was shown by Neher & Marty (1982) for exocytosis from
chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla and by Fernandez, Neher & Gom-
perts (1984) for secretion of histamine from rat peritoneal mast cells. In the
latter case, the granules are somewhat larger, leading to well-resolved step-
like increases in capacitance (see Fig. 6). These records show that capaci-
tance measurement is a high-resolution technique. The figure also shows,
however, that capacitance is not a very specific measure for secretion. This is
evident from the fact that there is a continuous, smooth decrease in capaci-
tance before exocytotic events show up. We found (Almers & Neher 1987)
that the rate of this decrease depends on the concentration of free intracel-
lular calcium [Ca]i, and that it has many properties expected for pinocytosis.
   We used capacitance measurement together with current recording and
microfluorimetry (fura-2) to simultaneously study, in a single cell, changes
in [Ca ]i and secretion at subsecond time resolution. We were surprised to
find quite different effectiveness of regulators of secretion in different cell
types (Fig. 7). For chromaffin cells, which in many respects resemble neur-
ones, the classical role of calcium as prime regulator of secretion was fully
confirmed (Augustine & Neher 1992). In mast cells, however, which are not
electrically excitable, changes in calcium concentration (in the physiological
range) had little effect. Ca-independent secretion had been described in a
number of inexcitable cell types (Haslam & Davidson 1984; Sha’afi et al.
1983; Di Virgilio et al. 1984). But for us, who were used to work with
electrically excitable cells, it was a shock not to be able to elicit secretion

Figure 6. High resolution capacitance recording during the onset of a mast cell degranulation.
Whole-cell recording from a rat peritoneal mast cell with a pipette containing 20 µM GTP-γ-S.
Initially the capacitance slowly decreased, probably due to retrieval of very small pinocytotic
vesicles. After some delay degranulation started, leading to a staircase-like increase in capaci-
tance, each step representing fusion of a single granule (adapted from Almers & Neher 1987).

with an intracellular solution buffered to about 1 µm free calcium. Initially,
we hypothesized, that the whole-cell configuration resulted in a loss of Ca-
dependent regulators by washout - in analogy to early work on muscle
contraction in skinned fibers. Later, we learned that cells in the whole-cell
recording configuration were still able to secrete, in response to GTP-γ-S, a
nonhydrolyzable analogue of GTP (Fernandez, Neher & Gomperts 1984).

Figure 7. Different effectiveness of intracellular free calcium in inducing a capacitance increase.
Part A represents a measurement from a bovine       chromaffin cell. The traces represent the time
courses of capacitance (top) and free calcium concentration (bottom; measured by fura-2
fluorescence) following a whole-cell penetration. Calcium rapidly rises, since the pipette was
filled with a Ca-EGTA mixture adjusted for free calcium of approximately 1 µM. On the
capacitance trace the step at the beginning (≅6 pF) represents the initial capacitance of the cell,
which becomes ‘visible’ at the moment of ‘break in’. Capacitance then rises about two to
threefold due to exocytosis. Part B shows a similar measurement on a pancreatic beta cell, with
only little capacitance increase, and part C shows the complete lack of response in a rat
peritoneal mast cell. Reproduced from Penner & Neher 1988.

With this response in hand, it was possible to show that calcium, although
not able to elicit secretion by itself, was still effective in accelerating an
ongoing secretory response. There was no indication of a loss of a Ca-
regulator; rather it appeared that the GTP-γ-S stimulus primed the cell to
render it more Ca-sensitive (Neher 1988).
   GTP-γ-S nonspecifically activates intracellular signal pathways, most
prominently the dual-signal pathway (Cockcroft & Gomperts 1985; Ber-
ridge & Irvine 1989). Using the repertoire of patch clamp methods, Penner
(1988) was able to show that various external secretagogoues, which are
known to also activate the dual signal pathway, lead to a characteristic
pattern of secretion. This is accompanied by IP3-induced Ca release from
intracellular stores. Combining the fura-2 technique with patch clamping
one can study the temporal relationship between this prominent transient
Ca signal and secretion. In spite of the modulatory effect of calcium
described above it was found that there is no strict correlation. The secre-
tory response very often starts well after the peak of the Ca signal. Also, the
Ca peak can be abrogated by including EGTA in the patch pipette without
drastic effects on secretion (Fig. 8). Phenomenologically, this can be ex-
plained by the fact that the Ca peak occurs very early at a time when the
above-mentioned priming effect of a chemical stimulus has not occurred
yet. A sustained phase of increased calcium, which very often follows the
Ca-release peak, is more efficient in accelerating secretion, however, since it
is more appropriately timed. In terms of molecular mechanisms, the prim-
ing is likely to represent protein kinase C activation (Heiman & Crews 1985;
Penner 1988). Additionally it has been shown that there is another G-
protein-mediated pathway, which links a hormonal stimulus to secretion
(Gomperts, Barrowman & Cockcroft 1986; Penner 1988). This link is sensi-
tive to pertussis toxin, and to intracellular application of cAMP (Penner
1988).
   Our studies on mast cells (see Penner & Neher 1989 for review) have
taught us that secretory control is not necessarily dominated by calcium, but
that rather it involves a meshwork of interacting second messenger path-
ways. In neurones, it appears that changes in calcium (Augustine et al.
1987) or calcium plus voltage (Parnas et al. 1986) largely determine the
kinetics of fast secretory events. However, there is increasing evidence that
other second messengers are responsible for plastic changes in synaptic
signals, possibly by regulating the availability of vesicles for secretion (Llinas
et al. 1991). Unfortunately, nerve terminals are usually not accessible to the
kind of biophysical investigations described here. However, recent studies
on neurosecretory cells reveal new details on the kinetics of Ca-induced
secretion (Thomas, Suprenant & Almers 1990; Augustine & Neher 1992;
Lim, Nowycky & Bookman 1990; Lindau et al. 1992). They promise to allow
a differentiation between the exocytotic event per se and some of the other
steps in the life cycle of a secretory vesicle. Together with the ability to
control second messengers such studies may soon lead to a better under-
