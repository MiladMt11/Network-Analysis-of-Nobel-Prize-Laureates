When I joined the Wellcome Research Laboratories in 1944, World War II
was in progress. Since the work I am about to discuss covers a period of
some 40 years, it may be pertinent to consider the “state of the art” at that
time. Our ultraviolet absorption spectra were measured with a Bausch and
Lomb spectrograph which had a carbon arc as the light source and photo-
graphic plates for recording the amount of light absorbed at each waveleng-
th. There was no paper or ion-exchange chromatography, and purines were
isolated and separated as copper and silver salts, or picrates, by fractional
crystallization. Tritium and 32P were available, but no 14C or 35S. Geiger
counters were used for counting radioactivity; scintillation counters came
much later. Some heavy isotopes, e.g., 15N and 13C were obtainable but
required the use of a mass spectrometer, which few laboratories had. The
state of knowledge of nucleic acids was rather rudimentary. We knew they
 contained purines and pyrimidines, but the sequences were not known. The
 prevailing theory was that there were two purines and two pyrimidines in
each tetranucleotide and that these tetranucleotides were strung together in
some fashion. However, the nature of the internucleotide linkage had not
been established, and the helical structure of DNA had not yet been
 proposed.
   In 1940, Woods and Fildes (1,2) had put forth the antimetabolite theory
to explain the action of sulfonamides on bacteria, suggesting that the
sulfonamides interfered with the utilization of a necessary nutrient, para-
aminobenzoic acid. Hitchings theorized that, since all cells required nucleic
acids, it might be possible to stop the growth of rapidly dividing cells (e.g.,
bacteria, tumors, protozoa) with antagonists of the nucleic acid bases. One
might hope to take advantage of the faster rate of multiplication of these
cells compared with normal mammalian cells and eventually sort out the
biochemical differences between various types of cells by the way they
responded to these antimetabolites (3,4). It was my assignment to work on
purines, pteridines, and some other condensed pyrimidine systems.
   It was, of course, necessary to have some biological systems to determine
                                                                           447

the potential activities of the new compounds. Essentially nothing was
known at that time about the anabolic pathways leading to the utilization of
purines for nucleic acid synthesis. A number of catabolic enzymes were
known: nucleases, nucleotidases, nucleosidases, deaminases (for guanine,
adenine, adenosine and adenylic acid), xanthine oxidase and uricase. In
1947, Kalckar described the reversibility of nucleoside phosphorylase (5).
The enzymes guanase and xanthine oxidase were useful in our laboratory to
examine the purines as substrates or inhibitors of these enzymes (6,7).
However, it was the microorganism Lactobacillus casei upon which we mainly
relied. It could grow on adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine or xanthine,
provided the pyrimidine thymine was added. It could also synthesize puri-
 nes and thymine if given a source of folic acid in the form of liver powder.
 (The structure of folic acid was not elucidated until 1946 by the Lederle
group (8). Hitchings and Falco had devised a screening test in which it was
possible to determine whether a compound could substitute for thymine (9)
or a natural purine (4,10) or inhibit its utilization, and could also determine
whether a compound was a folic acid antagonist (11,12).
   Few chemists were interested in the synthesis of purines in those days and-
I relied mainly on methods in the old German literature. The transforma-
tion reactions were carried out mainly by the methods of Emil Fisher and
the syntheses from pyrimidine intermediates by the methods of Traube. The
direct replacement of oxygen by sulfur by the method of Carrington (13)
also proved to be exceedingly useful for synthesizing the mercaptopurines
(14,15).
   In 1948, we found that 2,6-diaminopurine inhibited the growth of L. casei
very strongly and that the inhibition was reversed specifically by adenine
 but not by the other natural purines (4,16). However, low concentrations of
diaminopurine could also be reversed by folic acid, an attribute which
diaminopurine had in common with other diaminopyrimidines and dia-
mino-pyrimidine condensed systems (10). Studies on a diaminopurine-resis-
tant strain of L. casei revealed that it grew poorly on adenine as a source of
purine. We deduced that adenine and 2,6-diaminopurine must be anabo-
lized by the same enzyme, and that the product of diaminopurine anabolism
interfered with purine interconversion (17). That enzyme was reported by
Kornberg in 1955 to be adenylate pyrophosphorylase (adenine phosphori-
bosyltransferase) (18). When tested on mouse tumors and the AKR mouse
leukemia (19) or tumor cells in tissue culture (20) diaminopurine proved to
be strongly inhibitory. It produced two good clinical remissions in chronic
 granulocytic leukemia in adults but produced severe nausea and vomiting
 as well as severe bone marrow depression in two other patients (21).
Interestingly, diaminopurine showed activity against vaccinia virus, a DNA
virus, in vitro (22), but its toxicity in animals led us to abandon that possible
utility.

Antileukemic Drugs
 By 1951, we had made and tested over 100 purines in the L. casei screen (23)
 and discovered that the substitution of oxygen by sulfur at the 6-position of
 guanine and hypoxanthine produced inhibitors of purine utilization. 6-
 Mercaptopurine (6-MP) and 6-thioguanine (TG) were tested at the Sloan-
 Kettering Institute, with whom we had estabished a collaboration, and were
 found to be active against a wide spectrum of rodent tumors and leukemias.
 Of special interest was the finding by Clarke (24) that 6-MP-treated tumors,
 although they had not regressed completely in the host mouse, were not
 transplantable into other mice. After some animal toxicology studies by
 Philips et al. (25), Burchenal proceeded rapidly to clinical trial with 6-
 mercaptopurine (6-MP) in children with acute leukemia (26). At that time
 the only drugs available for the treatment of these terminally ill children
 were methotrexate and steroids, and the median life expectancy was
  between 3 and 4 months; only 30% lived for as long as one year. The findings
 that 6-MP could produce complete remissions of acute leukemia in these
 children, although most of them relapsed at various intervals thereafter, led
 the Food and Drug Administration to approve the drug for this use in 1953,
 a little more than two years after its synthesis and microbiological investiga-
 tion. A symposium on 6-MP was held at the New York Academy of Sciences
 in 1954 (27). The addition of 6-MP to the antileukemia armamentarium
 increased the median survival time to 12 months in these children, and a few
 remained in remission for years with 6-MP and steroids. This convinced us,
 as well as many other investigators in the cancer field, that antimetabolites
 of nucleic acid bases were fruitful leads to follow. Today 6-MP remains one
 of the dozen or more drugs found useful in the treatment of acute leuke-
 mia. With the use of combination chemotherapy with three or four drugs to
 produce and consolidate remission, plus several years of maintenance ther-
 apy with 6-MP and methotrexate, almost 80% of children with acute leuke-
 mia can now be cured.
    Although we felt we were on the right track in 1952, there were still many
 unanswered questions. How did 6-MP work? What was the reason for its
 differential effect on neoplastic cells? How could one improve this differen-
tial effect? Reversal studies with 6-MP in L. casei did not pinpoint antago-
 nism for any single purine. The inhibition was reversed by hypoxanthine,
 adenine, guanine and xanthine (28). However, studies with a 6-mercapto-
 purine-resistant strain of L. casei revealed that 6-MP was unable to utilize
 hypoxanthine for growth (29). Again, as with the earlier studies with 2,6-
 diaminopurine, we concluded that 6-MP and hypoxanthine were anabolized
 by the same enzyme and that interference with purine inter-conversions at
 the nucleotide level were involved (30). In 1955, (two years after the
 introduction of 6-MP into clinical use) the enzyme which converts hypox-
 anthine and 6-MP to their respective nucleotides was identified as hypox-
 anthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) (18). Also in the mid-fifties the
 pioneering work of Greenberg (31) and of Buchanan (32,33) revealed the
 pathways of the biosynthesis of purines and the importance of hypoxanth-

ine ribonucleotide (inosinic acid, IMP) as the first purine nucleotide formed
in this biosynthetic pathway. It took a number of investigators and a period
of years to unravel all of the pathways in which the nucleotide of 6-MP,
thioionsinic acid (TIMP), and nucleotides derived from TIMP participated
 as substrates and inhibitors (34). These are summarized in Fig. 1. Based on
 our current knowledge of enzyme inhibition constants and the concen-
trations of the various nucleotides achieved with the therapeutic regimens,
the principal sites of action appear to be feedback inhibition of de novo
purine synthesis (particularly by methylthioinosinic acid), inhibition of ino-
sinate dehydrogenase, and incorporation into DNA in the form of thio-
guanine (35). Selectivity for neoplastic cells probably depends on the levels
of the individual anabolic and catabolic enzymes. Catabolic enzyme levels
are generally much lower in tumor cells than in normal cells. In addition,
mitotic rate, drug transport and metabolite pool sizes can be responsible for
selective toxicity.
   While these biochemical studies were going on, we studied the metabolic
fate of 6-MP, first in mice (36) and then in humans (37). Pharmacokinetic
and metabolic studies were then in their infancy, perhaps because the
methodology for separation of metabolites and the counting of radioactive
samples as thin films in a flow Geiger counter were so tedious and time-
consuming. Nevertheless, using Dowex-1 and Dowex-50 ion-exchange col-
umns and paper chromatography, we investigated the fate of 6-MP in vivo
and attempted to discover whether it was possible to modify this metabolism
and thus improve the efficacy of 6-MP. We continued to synthesize deriva-

proach was the 1-methyl-4-nitro-5-imidazolyl derivative, the compound now
known as azathioprine (Imuran®). This compound acts as a pro-drug for 6-
MP which, due to the proximity of the ortho-nitro group, is subject to
attack by sulfhydryl groups and other nucleophiles (45-49) (Fig. 2). In
particular, the glutathione present in red cells reacts with azathioprine,
releasing 6-MP back into the plasma (47). This compound had a better
therapeutic index in mice bearing adenocarcinoma 755, being as active as 6-
MP but less toxic (50). In patients with leukemia, however, the chemothera-
peutic index of 6-MP and azathioprine were similar (51).

Immunosuppression and Transplantation
In 1958, a new horizon appeared. Robert Schwartz, working with William
Dameshek in Boston, investigated the effect of 6-MP on the immune re-
sponse, based on the rationale that the immunoblastic lymphocyte formed
during an immune response closely resembled leukemic lymphocytes.
Schwartz showed that when 6-MP was administered to rabbits for several
 days, beginning with the time of injection of a foreign antigen, e.g., bovine
 serum albumin, they were unable to mount an antibody response to that
antigen (52). He worked out the importance of drug dose and timing and
showed that 6-MP was most effective when treatment was started at the time
of antigen administration (52,53). He also demonstrated that animals could
be made tolerant to a particular antigen while still retaining immunological
reactivity to other antigens (54). At Schwartz’s instigation, we set up an
immunological screening test that consisted of measuring the antibody
response of mice to sheep red cells (55,56). It enabled us to identify new
active agents, synergistic combinations of drugs, and to show that immuno-
suppression was greater at higher doses of antigen and of drug.
    Roy Calne, a young British surgeon, stimulated by Schwartz’s papers,
decided to examine the effect of 6-MP on kidney transplant rejection in
dogs. He obtained a 44-day survival of a kidney from an unrelated donor in
a dog given daily doses of 6-MP (57). This was considerably longer than the
expected 9 to 10 day graft survival in control animals. When Calne asked us
for compounds related to 6-MP which he might investigate, we suggested
that azathioprine might have some advantages. The studies which followed
showed azathioprine to be superior to 6-MP for preventing rejection of
canine kidney homografts (58,59). Successful transplantation of kidneys to
unrelated recipients became a reality in man in 1962, with regimens of
immunosuppression consisting of azathioprine and prednisone (60). By
1977, the Kidney Registry had records of 25,000 kidney transplants done
between 1965 and 1972 (61), and the numbers have continued to increase
yearly (62, 63). Today the procedure is considered therapeutic rather than
experimental, and the importance of histocompatibility matching is recog-
nized (63). Other organ transplants, e.g., liver, heart and lung, have likewise
become possible. Other immunosuppressive drugs, e.g., Cyclosporin, have
 come into use in recent years, but azathioprine remains a mainstay in kidney
 transplantation.

  The immunosuppressive effects of azathioprine have been studied in a
wide variety of immunological systems. The earlier work is reviewed in (64)
and more recent studies in (65). Immunosuppressive drugs have also shown
utility in the treatment of autoimmune disease. Remissions with 6-MP,
thioguanine and azathioprine have been reported in autoimmune hemolytic
anemia, systemic lupus, and chronic active hepatitis (65). Azathioprine is
now an approved drug for the treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis (66).

Gout and Hyperuricemia
 It was time now to try a new approach to the potentiation of 6-MP activity.
Since we knew from metabolic studies that 6-thiouric acid was one of the
principal products of 6-MP catabolism, it seemed possible that we could
interfere with this oxidation by inhibiting the enzyme responsible for it,
xanthine oxidase. In the early days of seeking antimetabolites for the.
natural purines in our laboratory, xanthine oxidase had been one of test
enzymes. Doris Lorz had identified many substrates as well as inhibitors of
this enzyme (7). These compounds had also been tested on L. casei and on
animal tumors. To test for xanthine oxidase inhibition in vivo, we chose a
compound that had no inhibitory effects on bacteria or tumors, was non-
toxic, but which was a potent inhibitor of xanthine oxidase. This compound
was the hypoxanthine analog, 4-hydroxypyrazolo (3,4-d) pyrimidine (allopu-
rinol). When allopurinol was given to mice together with 6-MP, it did indeed
inhibit the oxidation of 6-MP and potentiated the antitumor and immuno-
suppressive properties of 6-MP three to fourfold (45,67,68). Moreover, the
toxicity of 6-MP to mice appeared to be potentiated only two fold, so that
the chemotherapeutic index of 6-MP had been increased. Was it possible
that the same phenomenon would occur in man? With the collaboration of
Wayne Rundles, we explored this possibility in patients with chronic granu-
locytic leukemia in whom the efficacy and metabolism of 6-MP could be
investigated. As had happened in mice, the oxidation of 6-MP to thiouric
 acid was inhibited in a dose-related manner, and the antileukemic activity of
 6-MP was potentiated proportionally (45, 69-71). Figure 3 illustrates the
four fold reduction in thiouric acid and increase in 6-MP when 300 mg
allopurinol was given together with 110 mg 6-MP. Later investigations (72)
showed that the increased activity of 6-MP was accompanied by a proportio-
nal increase in toxicity. Thus, although less 6-MP was required to produce
an antileukemic effect, the therapeutic index of 6-MP for leukemia rema-
ined unchanged.
    Xanthine oxidase is responsible not only for the oxidation of 6-MP, but
 also for the formation of uric acid from hypoxanthine and xanthine (Fig. 4).
 Consequently, treatment with allopurinol produces a marked decrease
in both serum and urinary uric acid (69,71,73,74). This presented the
possibility of a unique approach to the treatment of gout and other forms of
hyperuricemia.
    It was recognized at the outset that the inhibition of an enzyme like
xanthine oxidase in vivo might present some difficulties. First, there was the

question as to whether the inhibitor had a sufficiently long half-life in the
body to produce a persistent reduction in uric acid production. There was
also the possibility that the inhibition would result in an unacceptable
accumulation of the intermediates, hypoxanthine and xanthine, the latter
compound being about as insoluble as uric acid. Moreoever, it was possible
that more enzyme would be induced by the presence of excess amounts of
the intermediates, leading to the need for ever-increasing amounts of
inhibitor. Finally, one had to consider carefully the long-term effects of this
inhibitor, since gout patients would probably continue to take the drug for
life. All of these possibilities were thoroughly examined, first in animals and
then in man.
   Allopurinol is not only a potent competitive inhibitor of xanthine oxidase,
 but it is also a substrate (75), the oxidation resulting in the corresponding
 xanthine analog, oxypurinol (called alloxantine, oxoallopurinol, or oxi-
 purinol in early papers) which is also a xanthine oxidase inhibitor (Fig. 4).
Oxypurinol also has the unusual property of binding very tightly to the
reduced form of the enzyme, thereby inactivating it (75,76). The enzyme
activity can be restored by oxidation, which takes place slowly in the pres-
ence of air (76,77). Although allopurinol itself has a short half-life in plasma
(about 90 to 120 minutes) oxypurinol has a very long half-life, 18 to 30
hours (75,78,79). This is due to the fact that oxypurinol is reabsorbed in the
proximal tubule of the kidney (80). Consequently, steady-state levels of
 oxypurinol are achieved in a few days, and uric acid concentrations can be
 maintained at the desired level by proper dose-adjustment (80). Because
allopurinol is completely absorbed orally, whereas oxypurinol is not, allo-
purinol remains the ideal pro-drug for oxypurinol.
   The fate of the intermediate oxypurines, hypoxanthine and xanthine,
turned out to be a fascinating one. These oxypurines do not accumulate in
the serum. In fact, their serum levels rise very little during allopurinol
treatment (79,8l). There are two reasons for this. One is that both hypox-
 anthine and xanthine can be reutilized for nucleic acid synthesis via the enzyme
 hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT) (82, 83).
 The nucleotides formed, IMP and XMP, are the normal interme-
diates for adenine and guanine nucleotides (AMP, GMP). Through a pro-
cess of feedback inhibition IMP, AMP and GMP can reduce the de novo
synthesis of purines by inhibiting PRPP-amidotransferase (84). Thus, the
salvage of hypoxanthine and xanthine serves to regulate purine biosynthe-
sis, reducing it when it is excessive. When the oxypurines are not reutilized,
they are excreted by the kidney by glomerular filtration, since they are not
reabsorbed by the kidney tubule to any significant degree (85,86).
    Long-term studies with allopurinol in animals and in man have shown
 that new enzyme is not induced and that allopurinol is a safe and effective
drug for long-term treatment (87). A few percent of patients develop a rash
when taking allopurinol. Patients with poor kidney function require lower
doses of drug because of the pharmacological properties of oxypurinol and
its long half-life (88).

  Allopurinol helps to alleviate several of the clinical problems associated
with gout. The hyperuricemia of gout produces deposits of small crystals of
uric acid in joints which results in extreme pain, or large deposits, tophi,
which result in gouty arthiritis and restricted joint movement. In patients
who excrete excessive amounts of uric acid in the urine, urate stones often
form in the kidney. With allopurinol it has been possible to prevent and
reduce the tophaceous deposits and to prevent urate stone formation
(74,81,87,89,90). Likewise, the secondary hyperuricemia which is associat-
ed with the therapy of malignancy can be reduced with allopurinol treat-
ment (91).

Antiprotozoal Effects of Allopurinol
I would like to digress at this point, to describe another use for allopurinol
which materialized about 10 years later, because it typifies the kind of
chemotherapeutic selectivity which can be achieved with purine analogs as
the result of differences in the specificities of parasitic and mammalian
enzymes. The finding by Joseph Marr (92) that allopurinol inhibits the
replication of Leishmania donovani led us into an extended collaboration’
with Marr to discover the biochemical basis for this unexpected activity
(93    101). Leishmaniae and trypanosomes, like many other unicellular
parasites, lack the ability to synthesize purines de novo. They do, however,
have ample quantities of salvage enzymes which enable them to utilize pre-
formed purines and nucleosides present in the mammalian blood stream.
Leishmaniae and trypanosomes have large amounts of the enzyme HPRT
capable of utilizing allopurinol as a substrate to a much greater extent than
does the human enzyme (97). Moreover, the enzyme adenylosuccinate
synthetase which has as its function the conversion of IMP to SAMP, the
intermediate for AMP, has a broader substrate specificity than does the
mammalian enzyme (96,101). The protozoa1 enzymes consequently convert
allopurinol ribonucleotide to the adenylate analog, 4-aminopyrazolopyrimi-
dine ribonucleotide, which is then converted to a di- and tri-phosphate and
incorporated in RNA (93,94,98,100). In the mammalian host this amination
 does not occur, and allopurinol is not incorporated into nucleic acids (102).
 The differences in the metabolism of allopurinol by the mammalian host
 and the trypanosomes is illustrated in Fig. 5. Allopurinol has shown activity
 in the treatment of leshmaniasis (103) and of Chagas’ disease
(caused by Tryeanosoma cruzi) (104). Allopurinol riboside, a minor urinary
metabolite of allopurinol in man, can likewise be converted by leishmaniae
in this way (94), whereas allopurinol riboside is not further metabolized in
man.

Antiviral Drugs
In 1968, we decided to return to a path which had intrigued us as early as
1948, the path to antivirals. The antiviral activity of 2,6-diaminopurine had
been provocative (22), although its toxicity had been discouraging. Mean-
while, the pursuit of 6-MP, thioguanine, azathioprine and allopurinol had

occupied 20 years. When it was discovered that adenine arabinoside (ara-A)
inhibited the growth of both DNA and RNA viruses (105), the information
started a train of thought. Would the arabinoside of 2,6-diaminopurine be
equally active? After all, diaminopurine had mimicked adenine in many
reactions and could be converted to a nucleoside and nucleotide by aden-
ine-metabolizing enzymes. Moreover, diaminopurine riboside was a poorer
substrate for adenosine deaminase than was adenosine. It therefore seemed
possible that the arabinoside might persist longer than ara-A, a compound
which is rapidly deaminated in vivo.
   Diaminopurine arabinoside was synthesized by Janet Rideout, and, since
we did not have a virus laboratory on site at the time, we sent the compound
to our colleague, John Bauer, in the Wellcome Research Laboratories in the
U.K. for antiviral screening. In a few weeks he informed us that this


compound was highly active against both herpes simplex virus and vaccinia
virus. Moreover, the compound was less cytotoxic to mammalian cells than
ara-A. Thus began our antiviral odyssey. For several years my group pur-
sued studies on the purine arabinosides, exploring structure-activity rela-
tionships, seeking better synthetic methods, and doing metabolic studies in
mice (106). Bauer and Collins studied the activity of these compounds in
rabbits and mice (106). We found that diaminopurine arabinoside (ara-
DAP) was deaminated to guanine arabinoside in mice and that the guanine
derivative (ara-G) was as active an antiviral as ara-DAP. In this respect, ara-
G had an advantage over the deamination product of ara-A, hypoxanthine
arabinoside, which had very poor antiviral activity. We were not certain
whether this advantage was sufficient to warrant the full-scale development
of ara-DAP.
   In 1970 our laboratories moved to North Carolina, and Howard Schaeffer
joined us as head of the Organic Chemistry Department. He had been
studying analogs of adenosine as substrates and inhibitors of the enzyme
adenosine deaminase, and had examined a variety of acyclic side chains on
the 9-position of adenine to determine what changes the enzyme would
tolerate in a substrate (107). He found that 9-(2-hydroxyethoxymethyl)-
adenine could still serve as a substrate for adenosine deaminase. This
suggested that other enzymes might also recognize such a side chain as a
pentose and that nucleoside analogs of this kind might have antimetabolite
properties.
   When the acyclic adenosine analog was tested in the antiviral screen, it
showed antiherpetic activity in vitro at about twice the concentration of ara-
A. The antiviral program now concentrated on the acyclic nucleoside ana-
logs, with the syntheses conducted by Schaeffer and Beauchamp, the anti-
viral testing by Bauer and Collins, and the mechanisms of action, enzymo-
logy and in vivo metabolism by my group (108,109). As was the case with the
purine arabinosides, the 2,6-diaminopurine analog proved highly active on
herpes simplex virus in vivo as well as in vitro. However, unexpectedly, the
guanine analog, acyclovir (acycloguanosine), was over 100 times as active as
the diamino compound (109). Acyclovir is a metabolic product of the
diaminopurine derivative, formed by the action of adenosine deaminase
and is undoubtedly responsible for the antiviral activity of the diamino
compound observed in vivo (110 112).

Acyclovir
One of the most intriguing aspects of the antiviral activity of acyclovir
 (ACV) is not only its high potency but its unusual degree of selectivity
 (Fig. 6) (108, 109, 113-115). It is highly active against herpes simplex
virus, types 1 and 2, and varicella zoster virus. It has activity against several
other herpes type viruses, e.g., Epstein-Barr virus, pseudorabies, but only
slight activity against the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV). It is not cyto-
toxic to the mammalian cells, in which these viruses are grown, at concen-
trations hundreds of times greater than the concentrations required for

antiviral activity. Moreover, the compound is inactive against other DNA
viruses, e.g., vaccinia, as well as RNA viruses (109). We decided that it was
highly important to determine the reason for this unusual selectivity, since
this would undoubtedly offer exploitable information about the herpes
viruses. In order to do these biochemical studies effectively, we set up a
virus laboratory in-house with Phillip Furman as its head. Radioactive
acyclovir labeled in the 8-position of the guanine with 14C or with 3H in the
side chain was synthesized. Vero cells, uninfected or infected with herpes
simplex virus type (HSV-l), were incubated with both types of radioactive
acyclovir for 7 hours. Extracts of these cells were then examined by high
pressure liquid chromatography. The extracts of the uninfected cells
showed only the presence of unchanged acyclovir. In the HSV-infected cells
three new radioactive compounds were formed (108). These products were
identified by enzymatic methods as the mono-, di and triphosphates (ACV-
MP, ACV-DP, ACV-TP) of acyclovir, and this was later confirmed by com-
parison with authentic synthetic samples. The enzyme responsible for the
conversion of acyclovir to its monophosphate was laboriously isolated,
purified and identified by James Fyfe as a herpes virus-specified thymidine-
kinase (108, 116). While this enzyme had been reported to be formed in
 herpes virus-infected cells, it was unexpected that an acyclic nucleoside
 of guanine could serve as its substrate. Nevertheless, this proved to be the
case. A similar enzyme is specified by the varicella zoster virus. Once the
first phosphate has been added, the second phosphate is added by cellular
 guanylate kinase (117) while several other cellular kinases can add the third
 phosphate (118). Since the cellular thymidine kinase cannot use acyclovir as
a substrate, very little ACV-TP is formed in uninfected cells (108,119). The
small amount of phosphorylation which occurs in normal cells is due to a 5’-
 nucleotidase (120). The pathways for the formation of ACV-TP are shown in
 Fig. 7.
   When it was apparent that the active antiviral compound was ACV-TP,
the interaction of this compound with viral and cellular DNA polymerases
was investigated. ACV-TP proved to be a more potent inhibitor of the
herpes virus DNA polymerase than of cellular DNA
(121,122). The quantitative aspects of these differences in the amounts of
ACV-TP formation and DNA polymerase inhibition             value) by ACV-TP in
 virus-infected cells and uninfected cells are illustrated in Fig. 8 (123).
 Moreover, ACV-TP serves as a substrate for the herpes virus DNA polymer-
ase; but chain termination occurs when it is incorporated, because of the
absence of the 3’-hydroxyl group needed for chain elongation (113). Thus,
only very small fragments of viral DNA are formed (124). In addition, ACV-
TP serves not only to inhibit, but also to inactivate, the viral DNA polymer-
ase following the formation of the enzyme-template-acyclovir monophos-
phate complex (125). This inactivation does not occur with cellular DNA
polymerase.
   The high selectivity of acyclovir for those herpes viruses which induce a
herpes-specified thymidine kinase can thus be explained. This enzyme has

proved to be a very useful tool for determining the structural requirements
for other potential substrates of this enzyme (126). Its absence or alteration
also explains the resistance of some herpes virus isolates to acyclovir
(127,128,129). On the other hand, transfection of cells with a portion of the
herpes virus genome containing the HSV thymidine kinase gene transforms
normally resistant cells to ACV-sensitive cells (130). Resistance to ACV may
also result from mutations in the viral DNA polymerase (127,128,129).
   Epstein-Barr virus and human cytomegalovirus infection do not induce a
specific kinase capable of phosphorylating acyclovir. However, the DNA
polymerase of Epstein-Barr virus is exquisitely sensitive to the small amount
of ACV-TP formed in EBV-infected cells (131). Interestingly, although
HCMV-infected cells do not phosphorylate acyclovir to any extent, they do
phosphorylate the closely related acyclovir derivative, ganciclovir, (formerly
called BW B759U, DHPG, and 2’NDG) which has an extra hydroxymethyl
group on the side chain. Consequently, ganciclovir has proven to be a much
better. inhibitor of HCMV replication than acyclovir (132 134).
   Investigation of the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of acyclovir in
several animal species and then in man revealed that it was a remarkably
stable compound. Only two metabolites were found, the 2-carboxymethoxy-
methylguanine (CMMG) and 8-hydroxyacyclovir (135). In man, the carboxy
derivative CMMG accounted for 9 14% of an intravenous dose of acyclo-
vir, while essentially none of the 8-hydroxy metabolite appeared in the urine

(136,137). In other species there were somewhat increased amounts of both
metabolites (135,137,138). Acyclovir has a plasma half-life of approximately
three hours (139) so that an intravenous infusion is generally given every
eight hours. Because acyclovir is excreted at about twice glomerular filtra-
tion rate and has a limited solubility in water (2.5 mg/ml at 37°C) it is
administered as a one-hour intravenous infusion rather than as a bolus
injection. The compound is also active topically and orally. Although the
oral bioavailability is limited, the blood levels attained by oral administra-
tion of acyclovir are adequate for therapeutic efficacy against herpes sim-
plex and varicella zoster viruses (140).
   The compound is distributed in all body tissues and crosses the blood-
brain barrier (109,135,141). Toxicology studies in mice, rats and dogs
showed the drug to be non-toxic at doses well above those required for
therapeutic efficacy (142).
   Acyclovir has now been in clinical use for about eight years and it seems
appropriate to mention some of the areas in which it has decreased suffer-
ing and saved lives. First episodes of genital herpes infections are character-
ized by pain, prolonged viral excretion, and slow healing of lesions. Acyclo-
vir given by either the intravenous or oral routes produces a significant
alleviation of symptoms and decreases the time of viral shedding and time to
healing (Table 1) (143). Recurrent episodes of genital herpes are generally
much shorter and less severe than the initial one. Therefore, the benefits of
acyclovir treatment appear to be less dramatic. However, in a study in which
patients initiated oral therapy, there was a significant difference in new
lesion formation, 23% on placebo, 6.5% on ACV (147). For patients with
frequently recurring genital herpes, e.g., once a month, of several years
duration, it has been possible to decrease the frequency of recurrence to a
mean of 1.8 episodes during the first year and 1.4 episodes during the
second year by oral prophylaxis with acyclovir (148). The percentage of
patients having no recurrences in a year of oral prophylactic therapy was
45-50% (149).
   Herpes zoster, commonly known as shingles, is caused by a reactivation of
latent varicella zoster virus. It produces severe pain during the acute two to
three week episode, as well as a post-herpetic neuralgia months later in
about 10 percent of patients. Acyclovir causes a significant decrease in the
duration of acute pain but has little effect on the post-herpetic neuralgia
(150). In immunocompromised individuals, herpes zoster can produce seri-

ous sequelae in the form of progressive skin dissemination and visceral
disease. The latter can be fatal in a small percentage of patients. Intrave-
nous treatment with acyclovir has effectively prevented this dissemination
(151).
   Herpes simplex infections in immunosuppressed individuals is a serious
medical problem. Virus continues to be shed for a long time and healing is
slow. In two studies which involved 97 immunocompromised patients (152)
with a variety of diseases and 34 bone marrow transplant recipients (153)
the effects of intravenous acyclovir treatment on viral shedding, pain and
time to healing were highly significant (Table 2). In bone marrow transplant
patients and in leukemic patients, prophylaxis with acyclovir has made it
possible to prevent the reactivation of latent virus during therapy so that the
patients can remain free of herpetic episodes during the period of maxi-
mum immunosuppression (154,155). The treatment of herpes encephalitis,
a frequently fatal disease, with intravenous acyclovir has been successful in a
large percentage of patients if begun before the patient is comatose
(156,157).
   In addition to the clinical utility of acyclovir, the lessons learned from its
development have proven to be extremely valuable for future antiviral
research. In depth studies of mechanisms of action have led to a better
understanding of the enzymatic differences between normal and virus-
infected cells. It has given impetus to the search for other viral-specific
enzymes which are capable of therapeutic application.
   In my attempt to cover 40 years of research on purines and purine
analogs, I have been able to give you only a bird’s eye view. However, I hope
that I have successfully conveyed our philosophy that chemotherapeutic
agents are not only ends in themselves but also serve as tools for unlocking
doors and probing Nature’s mysteries. This approach has served us well and
has led into many new areas of medical research. Selectivity remains our aim
and understanding its basis our guide to the future.
