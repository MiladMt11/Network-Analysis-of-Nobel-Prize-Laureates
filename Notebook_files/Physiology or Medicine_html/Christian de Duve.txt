INTRODUCTION

In one of her masterpieces, Nobel Laureate Selma Lagerlöf tells how the little
boy Nils Holgersson visited the whole of Sweden, from Skåne to Lappland,
on the wings of a friendly white gander.
   I too have made a wonderful journey, using like Nils Holgersson an un-
conventional mode of travel. For the last 25 years, I have roamed through living
cells, but with the help of a centrifuge rather than of a microscope.
   On these trips I was never alone. I want to mention this at the outset, since
I owe much to my travelling companions. Some of their names will come up
as my tale unfolds; but there are so many of them that I will be quite unable
to mention them all. My debt goes also to my early mentors in science:
Joseph Bouckaert, Joseph Maisin, Hugo Theorell, Carl and Gerty Cori, Earl
Sutherland. Four of them have preceded me on this podium. Three, un-
fortunately, are not with us any more.


THE DEVELOPMENT            OF   ANALYTICAL   CELL FRACTIONATION

Thirty years ago, much of the living cell still remained virtually unexplored.
The reasons for this are simple. Morphological examination was limited down-
ward in the scale of dimensions by the resolving power of the light microscope,
whereas chemical analysis stopped upward at the size of the smaller macro-
molecules. In between, covering almost two orders of magnitude, lay a vast
“terra incognita”, impenetrable with the means of the day. Invasion of this ter-
ritory started almost simultaneously on its two frontiers, after electron micro-
scopy became available to morphology and centrifugal fractionation to bio-
chemistry.
   When, in 1949, I decided to join the little band of early explorers who had
followed Albert Claude in his pioneering expeditions, electron microscopy was
still in its infancy. But centrifugal fractionation, the technique I wanted to
use, was already well codified. It had been described in detail by Claude him-
self (1), and had been further refined by Hogeboom, Schneider and Palade
 (2) and by Schneider (3). According to the scheme developed by these
workers, a tissue, generally rat or mouse liver, was first ground with a Potter-
Elvehjem homogenizer, in the presence of either 0.88 M (2) or 0.25 M (3)
sucrose. The homogenate was then fractionated quantitatively by means of
three successive centrifugations and washings,          under increasing centrifugal

force x time integrals, to yield “nuclei”, “mitochondria”, “microsomes” and a
final supernatant. The fractions,       as well as the original homogenate, could
then be analyzed for their chemical composition, enzyme content, and other
properties.
   All these details were available in the literature, and there seemed little
more for us to do than to acquire the necessary equipment and follow instruc-
tions carefully, especially since our interest in cell fractionation itself was
rather peripheral at that time. All we wanted was to know something about
the localization of the enzyme glucose 6-phosphatase, which we thought might
provide a possible clue to the mechanism of action, or lack of action, of in-
sulin on the liver cell.
   Fortunately, this is not exactly how things happened. Working with me on
this project was Jacques Berthet, still a medical student at that time, but with
an unusually mature and rigorous mind. He went about the job of setting up
the technique in a careful and systematic fashion, paying special attention to
all physical parameters. A few practical tips from Claude, who had just re-
turned to Belgium, were also helpful.

an abscissa value comprised between x and x +                        dx. Similar diagrams may be drawn in
terms of relative mass, relative enzyme activity, etc                ..., instead of relative number.


   Particularly important, I now realize in retrospect, was the fact that we
took some time to study the theory of centrifugation, as beautifully exposed in
the classical book by Svedberg and Pedersen (4).
   Although separating mitochondria and microsomes might appear worlds
apart from the determination of the molecular weight of macromolecules,
certain concepts were common to the two operations and could be usefully
transposed from the latter to the former.
   One was that of sedimentation coefficient (Fig. 1), which obviously was
applicable to any particle, irrespective of its size.
   Another was that of polydispersity which, owing to biological variability,
was likely to be a property of the populations made up by subcellular
organelles. This meant that the centrifugal behavior of such populations
could be described only by a frequency distribution curve of sedimentation
coefficients (Fig. 2), not by a single s value as for most molecular popula-
tions.
   A third important point related to the           resolving power of differential
sedimentation, which some elementary calculations revealed to be surprising-
ly low (Fig. 3).
   There was much insistence in those days on the various artifacts that
complicate centrifugal fractionation, such as, for instance, breakage or ag-
glutination of particles, adsorption or leakage of soluble constituents. But
these were only accidents, no doubt serious, but amenable to experimental
 correction. The problem, as it appeared to us, was a more fundamental one.

What we were doing was trying to separate populations which, owing to over-
lapping polydispersities, might at best be only partly separable from each
other. In addition, we were using a poorly discriminating method                 for thi s
purpose.
   I cannot claim that all this was immediately clear to us. But considerations
of this sort undoubtedly colored our approach from the start (5). We fully
expected centrifugally isolated fractions to be impure, while suspecting that
populations of cell organelles might be difficult, if not impossible, to resolve
quantitatively. Conscious also of the severe limitations of light microscopic
examination of the fractions, we tried to extend the biochemical interpreta-
tion as far as possible. Instead of looking at each fraction separately and
focusing on its enzyme content, as was usually done, we looked rather at each
individual enzyme and contemplated its distribution between all the frac-
tions.
   In order to permit a comprehensive view of enzyme distribution patterns,
I introduced a histogram form of representation, illustrated in Fig. 4. In this
figure are shown the distribution patterns of three of the first enzymes we
studied, on the left as determined by the classical 4-fraction scheme, and on
the right as determined by the modified 5-fraction scheme that we worked out
in an effort to elucidate the significance of the small difference in distribution
observed between acid phosphatase and cytochrome oxidase (6). This dif-
ference, as can be seen, is very much magnified by the modification in frac-
tionation scheme.
 These histograms turned out to be very revealing, by more or less auto-
matically conveying the notion of polydispersity, illustrated in Fig. 2. In fact,

content (% activity/% protein) of the fractions is plotted against their relative protein
content, inscribed cumulatively from left to right in their order of isolation (decreasing
sedimentation coefficient) : nuclear        N, mitochondrial       M,   microsomal   P,     and super-
natant S, in classical 4-fraction scheme; and nuclear              N, heavy-mitochondrial     M, light-
mitochondrial   L, microsomal      P    and supernatant    S, in modified 5-fraction scheme (6).
Although very crude, similarity with frequency distribution curves of polydisperse popu-
lations can be recognized. Distinction between three populations, now known to consist
of mitochondria (cytochrome oxidase), lysosomes (acid phosphatase) and endoplasmic
reticulum fragments (glucose 6-phosphatase), is enhanced by use of 5-fraction scheme.

since the fractions are aligned along the abscissa in order of decreasing sedi-
mentation coefficient, one may, in a very crude fashion, look at the absciss                             a
as a deformed scale of sedimentation coefficients, and at the histograms a                               s
correspondingly deformed frequency distribution histograms of sedimentation
coefficients. The logical next step in this line of reasoning was to assimilat                           e


enzyme distributions to particle distributions, and therefore to interpret, at
least tentatively, significant differences in the distribution patterns of two
enzymes as reflecting association of the enzymes with distinct particle popu-
lations.
   Extrapolation from enzymes to particles could, however, not be made with-
out some sort of assumption concerning the relationship between relative
enzyme activity, the numerator in the ordinate of Fig. 4, and relative particle
number, the numerator in the ordinate of Fig. 2. The simplest, and at the
same time most plausible, such assumption was that members of a given
particle population have essentially the same biochemical composition, larger
particles simply having more of everything than smaller particles. Within the
limits of validity of this assumption,         which I have called the    postulate of
biochemical homogeneity, the histograms of Fig. 4 could now be likened to
distribution diagrams of total particle mass or protein (not of actual particle
numbers, it should be noted, although further conversion to numerical distri-
butions can be made with some additional information). We had to assume,
of course, that the enzyme distributions were not grossly distorted by trans-
location artifacts, or to correct for such artifacts as much as possible.
   Another postulate we made was that each enzyme is restricted to a single
intracellular site. This postulate of single location is less essential than that of
biochemical homogeneity, since bimodal or multimodal distributions are
amenable to the same kind of interpretation. In practice, however, single
location made a useful addition to biochemical homogeneity, supporting the
use of enzymes as markers of their host-particles.
   First used empirically as pure working hypotheses, the above considerations
were progressively validated, as more enzymes              were studied and a limited
number of typical distribution patterns began to emerge. Actually, as shown
by the results of Fig. 5, things were not quite as simple, and a number of
complications of various sorts tended to blur the picture. But most of these
could be dealt with satisfactorily by ancillary experiments (8).
   In these studies, a second line of evidence proved very useful, based on
enzyme latency. Owing to impermeability of particle membranes to one or
more of the substrates used in the assay of enzymes, many particle-bound
enzymes fail to display activity “in vitro” as long as the membrane surround-
ing them is intact. Various means,         mechanical, physical or chemical, can be
used to disrupt the membrane and to release the enzymes, as we first showed
for rat-liver acid phosphatase (Fig. 6). If two or more enzymes are present
together in the same particles, they will be released together in this kind of
experiment; if in different particles, they may come out separately (Fig. 7).
In our hands, such studies have been very useful, providing an independent
verification of the significance of the similarities and differences revealed by
centrifugation experiments.
   By 1955, our results were sufficiently advanced to allow us to propose with
a certain measure of assurance the existence of a new group of particles with
lytic properties, the lysosomes, and to hint at the existence of another group
of particles, the future peroxisomes (8). At the same time, we had, from the

left-hand column, are complex combinations of patterns I and II. Pattern III is shared
by 5 lysosomal acid hydrolases, except for                          which has an additional
microsomal component. Pattern IV belongs to the peroxisomal urate oxidase. Details are
given in original paper (8).

mixture of theoretical considerations and experimental results that I have
just briefly recalled, derived a certain “philosophy” of centrifugal frac-
tionation, which I subsequently elaborated in greater detail in several publi-
cations (11). The key word here was        “analytical”. Basically, we felt that our
approach was no more than an extension of the classical Svedberg technique
from the molecular to the submicroscopic and microscopic level.
   A major difficulty at this stage, however, was that available techniques did
not measure up to the kind of information we were hoping to extract. The
answer to this problem was provided by density gradient centrifugation, which
was introduced in the early 1950’s. This new technique offered prospects of
improved resolution; it allowed the use of density, as well as of sedimentation
coefficient, as separation parameter; and, finally, its analytical character was
unmistakable (Fig. 8). In fact, as shown as early as 1954 by Hogeboom and
Kuff (13), it could even be used successfully for the determination of
molecular weights.
   Here again, we devoted some time to theoretical studies (12). In this,
Berthet and I were joined by another young co-worker, Henri Beaufay, whose
skills as a self-taught engineer proved particularly valuable for the design of

various accessories, culminating in the construction of a completely automatic
rotor (14), different in principle from the zonal rotors built by Norman An-
derson (15), and particularly adapted to rapid isopycnic separation at
minimum hydrostatic pressure. The importance of the latter advantage has
been emphasized by my former collaborator Robert Wattiaux (16).
   Particles sedimenting through a density gradient are apt to undergo a
progressive increase in density, due to inflow of solute or outflow of water or
both, depending on the number and permeability properties of their mem-
branes and on the nature of the solute(s) and solvent used to make the
gradient. These factors we tried to incorporate in a theoretical model of
particle behavior (12, 17), and at the same time to take into account in the
design of our experiments. It appeared from our theoretical considerations
that the sucrose concentration of the medium might be a particularly im-
portant variable, and that different types of particles might respond dif-
ferently to changes in sucrose concentration. We therefore subfractionated
large granule fractions from rat liver in             iso-osmotic glycogen gradients
prepared with sucrose solutions of different concentrations as solvent, as well
as in sucrose gradients prepared with either H          2O or D 2O (18).

   The results of these experiments confirmed and extended our earlier find-
ings, establishing the existence of three distinct groups of enzymes, as defined
by their centrifugal behavior. There was little doubt in our minds that these
observations reflected the occurrence of three distinct populations of particles
in the large granule fraction. By fitting our results to the theoretical equation,
we were even able to evaluate a number of physical parameters for each
putative particle population, and to construct, from purely biochemical data,
a sort of “robot picture” of the particles themselves. This is shown in Table I.
Due to heterogeneity within the population, the data given in this table for the

lysosomes are of questionable significance. On the other hand, those listed for
mitochondria and peroxisomes agree very well with measurements made by
other techniques.
   Though analytically satisfactory, the results described so far still fell short
from definitive proof, since they had unfortunately confirmed our fear that
distinct populations of subcellular particles might prove intrinsically inseparable
quantitatively due to overlapping of      size and/or density distributions. It was
possible to obtain pure samples by cutting off non-overlapping parts of the
populations; but this introduced the danger of biased sampling. A means of
almost complete separation, although under somewhat artificial conditions,
was provided in 1962 by Wattiaux, Wibo and Baudhuin (19), when they
discovered that pretreatment of the animals with Triton WR-1339 causes a
selective decrease in the density of lysosomes, due to accumulation of the
Triton within these particles (Fig. 9). Thanks to this finding and to the
Beaufay rotor, large-scale separation of the three populations has now become
possible, allowing a variety of biochemical and functional studies that were
not feasible before (20).
   While the biochemical approach I have outlined was being developed in
our laboratory, electron microscopy was making great strides of its own, soon
becoming available for the examination of subcellular fractions. For obvious

reasons we were very anxious to take a look at our purest fractions, in order
to test our conclusions and eventually identify our hypothetical particles. Al-
ready in 1955, thanks to the expert collaboration of Alex Novikoff and to
the facilities of Albert Claude in Brussels and of Wilhelm Bernhardt in Paris,
we were able to do this for lysosome-rich fractions, which were found to con-
tain dense bodies, surrounded by a membrane and of about the size predicted
for lysosomes (21). Later, we were able to acquire an instrument of our own,
and Henri Beaufay taught himself another skill, which he later perfected under

the guidance of George Palade. With Pierre Baudhuin, he confirmed the
identification of lysosomes as “pericanalicular dense bodies” and showed that
the peroxisomes correspond to the particles known as “microbodies” (22).

Thus, the gap between biochemistry and morphology was finally bridged,
after some 15 years of research.
   More recently, Baudhuin has adapted quantitative morphometric methods
to the examination of subcellular fractions, making it possible to compare
measurements derived from biochemical data with those obtained by direct
mensuration (23). In several instances, excellent agreement has been found
between the two sets of data (20, 23, 24, 25).


A PPLICATIONS   TO   BIOLOGY

I have chosen to dwell at some length on our theoretical and technical studies,
because they were, I believe, the key to whatever achievements were made by
our group. I know that others have accomplished important advances by the
alternative process of first purifying a subcellular component and then
analyzing it. For example, nuclei, secretion granules, plasma membranes and
Golgi elements have been largely characterized in this fashion. But purifica-
tion is generally a laborious procedure, it is difficult to control, and it is rarely
quantitative. The advantage of the analytical approach is that it is widely
applicable, and it can provide a considerable amount of quantitative informa-
tion even with a relatively poor resolving power. The important point is that
with this kind of methodology, we derive the information, not from the
properties of specific fractions believed to approximate a given intracellular
component, but from the manner in which properties are distributed over a
large number of fractions, which together represent the whole tissue.
   In our laboratories, this general approach has been applied to a variety of
biological materials and for the study of many different problems. In continu-
ation of the work on liver, already described, it has supported a number of
studies concerned with the functions of lysosomes, including those of Robert
Wattiaux on intralysosomal storage (26),           of Pierre Jacques on pinocytosis
 (27), of Russell Deter on autophagy (28), of Jack Coffey, Nick Aronson and
Stanley Fowler on lysosomal digestion (29), and of Andre Trouet and Paul
Tulkens on the effects of anti-lysosome antibodies (30). It has also allowed
Brian Poole, Federico Leighton, Tokuhiko Higashi and Paul Lazarow to make
a searching analysis of the biogenesis and turnover of peroxisomes (24, 31).
In recent years, a large team grouped around Henri Beaufay and Jacques
Berthet, and including Alain Amar-Costesec, Ernest Feytmans, Mariette
Robbi, Denise Thinès-Sempoux and Maurice Wibo, has launched a major
attack on microsomal and other membrane fractions, with the aim of charac-
terizing physically, chemically, enzymically and immunologically the various
types of cytomembranes occurring in these fractions (32).
   In its applications to other mammalian tissues and cell types, analytical cell
fractionation has allowed Pierre Baudhuin and Brian Poole to recognize
peroxisomes in kidney (33); Gilbert Vaes to carry out a thorough study of
bone lysosomes, leading to very revealing observations on the role of these
particles in bone resorption (34); Bill Bowers to make a comprehensive bio-
chemical dissection of lymphoid tissues and lymphocytes, as a preliminary to

an analysis of cell-mediated immune cytotoxicity (35); Marco Baggiolini to
characterize the two types of granules present in neutrophil polymorphonuclear
leucocytes (36); Richard Schultz and Pierre Jacques to unravel some of the
complexities of placental tissue (37);     Tim Peters to fractionate aortic smooth
muscle cells (38) and enterocytes (39);     and Paul Tulkens to do the same for
cultured fibroblasts (40),    a system also used by Brian Poole and Maurice
Wibo for investigations of protein turnover (41).
   Under the leadership of Miklós Müller, a series of fascinating studies have
been performed in New York on a number of different protozoa. In              Tetra-
hymena pyriformis, Müller was able to identify two types of lysosomes, which
discharge their enzymes, one in phagocytic vacuoles and the other in the out-
side medium (42). In collaboration with Pierre Baudhuin and later with Jim
Hogg, he has shown the existence in the same organism of peroxisomes which,
like plant glyoxysomes, contain enzymes of the glyoxylate cycle (33, 43). More
recently, with Don Lindmark, he has characterized in         Trichomonads a com-
pletely new type of cytoplasmic particle,        with the capacity of converting
pyruvate to acetate, CO 2 and molecular hydrogen, the hydrogenosome (44).
   Other studies have dealt with the role of lysosomes in tissue regression,
notably those of Denise Scheib-Pfleger and Robert Wattiaux on Müllerian
ducts in chick embryos (45), and those of Yves Eeckhout on the tail of
metamorphosing tadpoles (46).
   It has been my good fortune to participate in most of these investigations,
sometimes actively and sometimes simply in an advisory capacity, and to watch
at the same time the growing interest of other laboratories in similar prob-
lems. After trying, with increasing difficulty, to review the field of lysosomes
at regular intervals (7, 47), I      welcomed with some relief the appearance in
1969, under the editorship of Professor John Dingle and Dame Honor Fell,
of the multi-author treatise “Lysosomes in Biology and Pathology”, of which
volume 4 is now in press (48). The literature on peroxisomes and related
particles has grown more slowly, but has now also reached an appreciable
size (49).
   It must be pointed out that many of these advances have been made by
means of morphological rather than by biochemical methods, or by a combi-
nation of both. In this respect, the development of cytochemical staining reac-
tions for enzymes previously identified biochemically as specific particle
markers has been an invaluable aid, thanks to the pioneering work of Alex
Novikoff, Stanley Holt, Werner Straus,            Fritz Miller, Sidney Goldfischer,
Marilyn Farquhar and many others.


A PPLICATIONS   TO   P ATHOLOGY   AND   THERAPEUTICS

In recent years, we have become increasingly concerned with the possible
medical applications of our findings.        The possibility that lysosomes might
accidentally become ruptured under certain conditions, and kill or injure their
host-cells as a result, was considered right after we got our first clues to the
existence of these particles. We even made a number of attempts to test this

hypothesis in ischemic tissue and in the livers of animals subjected to
hepatotoxic treatments or to carcinogenic diets (50). But we became dis-
couraged by problems of interpretation (47). Even today, clear-cut demon-
stration of the so-called “suicide bag”          hypothesis remains very difficult,
although there seem to be at least a few authenticated cases involving this
mechanism of cell death. Much more clearly documented is the mechanism
of tissue injury through extracellular release of lysosomal enzymes, a field
which has been pioneered by Honor Fell and her co-workers.
   The two mechanisms mentioned above rely on the very plausible instance
of lysosomal enzymes exerting their lytic effect at abnormal sites. What we
did not suspect in the beginning was that the failure of lysosomal enzymes to
act at their normal site could also cause serious diseases. This fact was brought
home to us in a rather surprising fashion through the work of my colleague
Géry Hers, who in 1962 diagnosed glycogen storage disease type II as being
due to a severe deficiency of a lysosomal enzyme (51). This finding initiated
a series of fruitful investigations on other storage diseases, in which Francois
Van Hoof played a major part (52). It also provided useful guidelines to the
chemists and pathologists who, in various parts of the world, were trying to
unravel the pathogeny of hereditary lipidoses and mucopolysaccharidoses. To-
day, with more than twenty distinct congenital lysosomal enzyme deficiencies
identified, this mysterious chapter of pathology has been largely elucidated
 (53).
   According to some results obtained over the last few years by Tim Peters,
Miklós Müller, Tatsuya Takano, Bill Black and Helen Shio, with the collab-
oration of Marilyn Farquhar, lipid accumulation in arterial cells during the
development of atherosclerosis could well be due to a mechanism similar to
that involved in congenital lipidoses. At least in cholesterol-fed rabbits, there
is strong evidence, both biochemical and morphological, that the lysosomes of
the aortic smooth muscle cells are the main site of intracellular cholesterol
ester accumulation, and there are indications that a relative deficiency of the
lysosomal cholesteryl esterase may be responsible for this phenomenon (38,
54). Fig. 10 shows some of the biochemical evidence: after cholesterol feed-
ing, lysosomes become considerably less dense due to lipid accumulation.
This figure also illustrates the sensitivity of our present techniques. These
fractionations were performed on a total of about 1 mg of cell protein. Similar
experiments can be, and have been successfully, carried out on a needle
biopsy.
   Other interesting applications of the lysosome concept are in pharmacology
and therapeutics. In line with the “suicide bag” hypothesis, early investigations
in this area focused on “labilizers” and “stabilizers” of the lysosomal mem-
brane (55). One outcome of this work has been the suggestion that certain
anti-inflammatory agents, such as cortisone and hydrocortisone, might owe at
least part of their pharmacological properties to their effect on the lysosomal
membrane.
   More recently, we have extended our interest to the various substances that
are taken up selectively into lysosomes and owe some of their main pharma-

cological properties to this phenomenon. These “lysosomotropic” agents are
surprisingly numerous, including such variegated compounds as neutral red,
chloroquine, streptomycin, dextran, polyvinylpyrrolidone, Triton WR-1339
and trypan blue (56). Particularly interesting is the use of certain lyso-
somotropic agents as carriers for drugs. In Louvain, Andre Trouet has applied
this principle to leukemia and cancer chemotherapy, by using DNA as carrier

for the drugs daunorubicin and adriamycin. Experimentally, these DNA
complexes proved less toxic and more effective on L1210 leukemia than the
free drugs (57). Clinical trials under way over the last two years in several
hospitals have given very encouraging results (58).




In the conclusion of his Nobel lecture delivered in 1955, Hugo Theorell asks
the question: “What is the final goal of enzyme research?”
   “The first stage”, he answers, “is to investigate the entire steric constitution
of all enzymes . .”
   “In the second stage,” he continues,         “it is a matter of deciding how the
enzymes are arranged in the cell-structures. This implies, as a matter of fact,
the filling of the yawning gulf between biochemistry and morphology”.
   The gulf still yawns today. But it is a particular pleasure for me to be able
to tell my old friend Theo that it yawns a little less. In our efforts to narrow it,
my co-workers and I have been privileged to contemplate many marvelous
aspects of the structural and functional organization of living cells. In addi-
tion, we have the deep satisfaction of seeing that our findings do not simply
enrich knowledge, but may also help to conquer disease.
