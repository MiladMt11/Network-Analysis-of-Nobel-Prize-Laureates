INTRODUCTION

In the life of animals, complex forms alternate with simple ones. An indivi-
dual develops from a simple one-celled egg that bears no resemblance to the
complex structure and pattern displayed in the juvenile or adult form. The
process of embryonic development, with its highly ordered increase in com-
plexity accompanied by perfect reproducibility, is controlled by a subset of
the animal’s genes. Animals have a large number of genes. The exact num-
ber is not known for any multicellular organism, nor is it known how many
and which are required for the development of complexity, pattern and
shape during embryogenesis. To identify these genes and to understand
their functions is a major issue in biological research.
   Genes can be detected by mutations, changes which affect their function.
Compared with other experimental approaches, mutations provide a uni-
quely powerful tool for studying the role of individual components in devel-
opment: Primarily, only a single component, the gene product, is removed
or altered, while the remainder of the organism is left intact. The function
of a gene can be deduced from the mutant phenotype, the way the animal
develops in the absence of the primary gene product. The mutant pheno-
type provides most useful information about a gene function. Genes with
similar phenotypes are likely to have similar functions, and their products
are likely to cooperate in a developmental process.
   Mutations occur spontaneously at a low rate, but their frequency can be
increased using X rays or chemicals which alter the DNA sequence. This pro-
perty was first used to systematically score for mutations affecting processes
of interest in bacteria and fungi (l-3). Mutations affecting developmental
processes had been collected in Drosophil a melanogaster more or less fortu-
itously, starting with the Bithorax mutation by Bridges in 1922 (4). In addi-
tion, a small number of embryonic mutants including Notch had been de-
scribed in detail by D. Poulson and collaborators (summarized in (5) ) . In the
seventies, more systematic approaches were started. In the nematode,
Caenorhabditis elegans , screens were begun by S. Brenner for mutations which

alter the stereotyped pattern of postemhryonic development (6). E. Lewis in
the California Institute of Technology collected a number of mutations
causing homeotic transformations in the adult and the larva of Drosophila
(7). In 1979, Eric Wieschaus and I, at that time in the EMBL, Heidelberg, had
developed the methods for the large scale screening for embryonic lethal
mutations in Drosophila . The screening procedure focused on the segmented
pattern of the larval epidermis (8). In this and subsequent screens, a num-
ber of new genes acting in the embryo and required for the formation of a
morphologically normal larva were discovered (9-11). Similar screens in
several laboratories have led to the identification of genes that are expressed
by the maternal genome, and whose products, laid down in the unfertilized
egg, control the expression of the zygotic genes (12-16). The subsequent
phenotypic analysis and molecular cloning of many of these genes, and inves-
tigation into the interactions of their products, resulted in a rather com-
plete general picture of the mechanisms establishing the anteroposterior
and the dorsoventral axis of the early embryo (17-19). These mechanisms
now provide a useful paradigm for the development of complexity from a
simply shaped egg cell.
   Drosophil a is a fly and as such has rather special properties. It is no more or
less “special” than a worm or a frog, but in many respects very different from
those animals. Therefore it was not clear a priori to what extent the results
obtained in Drosophil a could be generalized, and how much we could learn
from them for an understanding of the development of other animals, in
particular vertebrate species. Knowledge of vertebrate embryogenesis had
been collected predominantly in experiments in frogs (20) and chickens, but
only to a very small degree using genetic approaches. Because of the small
size and the turgor under which Drosophila embryos develop, transplantation
of tissues as done in frog and chicken is hardly possible in Drosophila , and the
power of systematic mutant searches for the analysis of complex processes,
although highly desirable, cannot readily be applied to most vertebrates.
Therefore, the description and understanding of the development of ani-
mals from the two phyla-arthropods with Drosophila , and vertebrates with
frogs and chicken, mice and man - were on such different levels, that for a
long time a comparison seemed almost pointless. However, the development
of recombinant DNA technology and with it the cloning of genes on a large
scale allowed a comparison of genes from different organisms on the basis of
DNA (or protein) sequences. Two most important findings emerged from
these studies:
   1. The biochemical function of Drosophil a gene products, in many cases,
could be deduced from a comparison of their amino acid sequences with
that of related and well characterized proteins from other organisms, such as
mammals, bacteria, or yeast. This revealed that many of the components con-
trolling development are members of well known classes of proteins, such as
transcription factors, protein kinases, secreted signalling molecules or recep-
tors.

   2. In many instances, the similarity between Drosophila and vertebrate
proteins was found not to be restricted to their biochemical properties, but
to extend to a true homology of function in a developmental process. This
homology is apparent both in similar expression patterns and in the pheno-
types obtained by eliminating the gene function by homologous recombina-
tion in mice. These studies lead to the surprising conclusion that the basic
features of body organization, such as specification along the anteroposte-
rior axis, and polarity of gastrulation, are apparently conserved in organisms
of different animal phyla (21, 22). This conservation suggests the existence
of a common basic body plan, originating from common ancestors, the first
bilaterally symmetrical organisms, in evolution.
   The investigation of genes discovered by their homology to Drosophila
genes is now one of the most successful approaches to an understanding of
the genetic control of vertebrate development. Although the elegant meth-
od of homologous recombination in the mouse allows the introduction of
mutations into the chromosomal copy of any previously cloned gene (23),
there is no way of predicting which genes are indispensable in development
and will therefore give an informative phenotype in knockout mice. An
important reason for the success of the homology approach is based on the
fact that the Drosophila genes in question represent a small fraction of the ani-
mal’s genes, that were selected, through mutagenesis experiments, for being
crucial and indispensable in development. Their vertebrate homologs often
also have unique functions as revealed in the mouse (24).
   Approaches based on the homology between invertebrate and vertebrate
genes focus on conserved properties and therefore select against the featu-
res which make these animals different. Vertebrates have acquired specific
structures and novel mechanisms during evolution. In order to identify
genes affecting such functions, it is necessary to do mutagenesis screens
directly in a vertebrate organism. Therefore, several laboratories have estab-
lished methods to use the zebrafish as a model organism to analyze the
genetic control of embryonic development in a vertebrate (25-28).
   In this lecture I would like to discuss the Drosophila screens and their most
important results, but also their limitations. I will compare them with the
results of a large scale screen for mutations affecting development and pat-
tern in the zebrafish recently performed in my laboratory in Tübingen (29).


THE DROSOPHILA MUTANT SCREENS

As a model organism for genetical studies of development, Drosophila has a
long tradition and is by far the most well established organism available (30).
Also, it proved to be quite well suited for studying embryology. Some prop-
erties of Drosophila are listed in Table 1. Its small number of chromosomes
made possible the development of many genetical tools such as balancer
chromosomes carrying multiple inversions which prevent recombination,
visible markers that allow the scoring for the absence or presence of par-

Figure 1: Crossing schemes for isolating mutants with embryonic visible phenotype in Drosophila melanogaster
(left) and Danio rem (right). In Drosophilo, eye colors and wing shape are markers useful for the distinction
of carrier animals from noncarriers, which inevitably are produced in the crosses required for inbreeding.
They also are useful for determining whether a lethal mutation was induced (absence of white eyed progeny
in the F3). Marking and selecting systems, i. e. balancers, recessive mutations and dominant temperature sen-
sitive mutants useful for selection, are available for each major chromosome, but it is not easy to do screens
for the entire genome at once, because the multitude of markers significantly affects viability. Drosophila lar-
vae hatch mechanically, a process that is very sensitive to perturbations. A large fraction of lethal mutations
prevent hatching, although most of them do not visibly affect the embryonic pattern. Mutant embryos can
be separated as unhatched from their normal siblings. In the zebrafish, the large number of chromosomes
makes the development of marking systems impractical. Instead, the entire genome is scored at once, and
in each generation, carriers must be recognized by the production of mutant progeny with a visible pheno-
type. Mutations causing lethality without a visible mutant phenotype cannot readily be detected. In the F3,
only a quarter of the crosses will yield mutant embryos (25% of all embryos), as only half of the F2 fish share
a particular mutation, but there is no way to distinguish carriers from noncarriers.

with the giant chromosomes that provide a physical measure for the number
of genes, it is possible, in Drosophila, to determine rather accurately the total
number of genes essential for survival and fertility. About 5000 genes muta-
te to lethality. The number of genes required for fertility is less well defined,
but is probably not more than one thousand. However, the total number of
genes, defined as transcription units, is much larger, about 20000. This
means that in Drosophila the majority of the genes do not have indispensable
functions. A large fraction, about one third of all lethal mutations, cause a
failure of the embryo to hatch (embryonic lethality), however, only about
ten percent of the embryonic lethals show an easily detectable and specific
morphological phenotype in the unhatched differentiated larvae.
   The Drosophila larva displays a clear axial organization with many land-
marks of position and polarity, which are provided by the external cuticle
shed by the larval epidermis (Figure 2). This larval skin is derived from a

belts seen in the normal larva, are deleted. Anterior up

large portion of the embryonic fate map, while the remainder of the blasto-
derm largely gives rise to internal organs which are less visible in the living
embryo. However, while for the skin an excellent and simple fixation tech-
nique is available, at the time of the mutant screens there were no efficient
methods to allow visualization of the internal organs, which are hidden, by
the opaque yolk. This problem has been overcome now by the development
of molecular probes and antibodies, and a number of screens have used
these for the detection of mutants, albeit every screen has been for a rather lim-
ited range of phenotypes. The properties and advantages of Drosophila for the
genetical analysis of embryonic pattern formation are summarized in Table 1.
   In the Heidelberg screens (9-11), we collected mutants detectable by a
distinct and significant deviation from normal patterning of the cuticle.
These mutants, after complementation tests, defined about 130 genes, dis-
tributed randomly over the three major chromosomes. Using similar scoring
criteria, screens for maternal mutants, defining about 30 genes, were per-
formed in several laboratories (12-16). Without molecular markers, most of
the mutant phenotypes could not readily be analyzed and interpreted at the
time. We used rather pragmatic criteria both for screening and characteriza-
tion of the mutant embryos. By similarity in phenotype, several groups of
genes were recognized that probably were affecting the same or related devel-
opmental processes. Subsequent phenotypic and genetic analysis, followed
by the molecular cloning of the genes, frequently supported this notion. The
groups of genes identified in the mutant screens are shown in Table 2.
   In our screens, we put great emphasis on completeness, i. e. on the satu-
ration of the genome with mutants detectable by our criteria. Several lines of
evidence, such as allele frequency and comparison with phenotypes of dele-
tion mutants, supported the notion that the majority of genes which mutate
to a phenotype visible in the larval cuticle had been discovered in our
screens. As an additional generation of inbreeding is required, the screens
for maternal mutants were more demanding and difficult than those for
embryonic lethals. Therefore, it is likely that the degree of saturation for the
maternal genes is not as high as that for the zygotically expressed genes.
While the screens were successful in the identification of many important
genes, and screening more lines would not have significantly increased the
number of genes discovered, we were aware of a number of severe intrinsic
limitations of our approach:
   Genetic redundancy: At the time, the viewpoint held amongst most
Drosophila geneticists was that genes not mutating to lethality or sterility were
almost not worth studying. There was the tacit assumption that the great
majority of all genes were essential for survival or fertility. Concern about
redundancy and duplicated genes was a later issue, as it depended on the
physical isolation of a gene by cloning, whereas in “precloning times” a gene
was only detectable by a mutation causing a phenotype. However we took
redundancy as a theoretical possibility into account. Among the segmenta-
tion genes, a number of cases of gene duplications have been fortuitously dis-

covered during the molecular analysis. As methods of reversed genetics are
not generally applicable in Drosophila, the proportion of redundant genes
cannot readily be determined. It is not at all clear why some genes are dupli-
cated and others not.
   Maternal and zygotic contribution: Another limitation we were more con-
cerned about was that genes whose products were required both maternally
and zygotically would be difficult to detect in mutant screens. This concern
applied in particular to the maternal mutants: in cases of additional func-
tions in the embryo, mutations in genes with important maternal functions
might be lethal zygotically and therefore cannot be discovered in maternal
screens. A number of such cases have been found. In addition, in cases where
the product is provided maternally, the zygotic phenotype may not represent
the complete lack of function. To this day, the genes required both mater-
nally and in the zygote are not easily accessible to investigations of function.



AXIS DETERMINATION IN DROSOPHILA

A large fraction of the genes identified in both the zygotic and the maternal
screens affect either the anteroposterior or the dorsoventral axis. The pat-
tern of the larva is composed of a series of segments that change their cha-
racter from anterior to posterior. At both ends, nonsegmented terminal
structures are located. The pattern also displays a clear dorsoventral dif-

ference, although the ventralmost (mesoderm) and dorsalmost (amnioserosa)
structures of the embryonic fate map are not represented in the epidermal
pattern.
   The anteroposterior axis: We defined three classes of zygotic segmentation
genes, which we called gap genes, pair rule genes and segment polarity genes
(8). In mutant embryos of the gap genes, large unique regions are deleted.
In pair rule mutants, deletions in the pattern affect homologous regions in
every other segment (Figure 2), while every segment shows a defect in
mutants of the class of segment polarity genes. The phenotypes suggested
that the process of segmentation involves at least three levels of spatial orga-
nization: Processes beginning during oogenesis define the large unique
regions requiring the gap gene function, the gap genes in turn control a
repeat pattern with the periodicity of double segments. Finally, the indivi-
dual segments are established as developmental units in response to the
action of the pair rule genes (8).
   The subsequent molecular analysis of the properties and function of the
segmentation genes was carried out in many laboratories. In these studies,
the method to make transgenic flies using P element induced germline
transformation, developed by Alan Spradling and Gerald Rubin, opened up
a rich repertoire of powerful approaches (31). Many of the segmentation
genes are transcription factors that control the expression domains of other
segmentation genes, either within the same or of the downstream class. The
pattern of expression of many segmentation genes in first approximation
corresponds to the deletion pattern displayed in cuticle preparations (18).
During early embryogenesis, a series of such molecular prepatterns, compo-
sed of the expression domains of transcription factors, which are the pro-
ducts of the segmentation genes, is formed. The gap genes are expressed in
large unique regions early in embryogenesis, their expression patterns being
controlled by maternally provided transcription factors (18). The earliest
metameric pattern, that of the pair rule genes, has 7 stripes that are deter-
mined one by one by the action and interaction of a particular combination
of gap gene products (32,33). The pair rule genes finally control the pattern
of more than 14 stripes preceding the formation of the morphological pat-
tern, the segments (34) (Figure 3).
   The identification and analysis of the maternal genes affecting the seg-
mentation pattern revealed that the anteroposterior axis is controlled by
three groups of genes, each independently determining a subset of the pat-
ter-n, the segmented anterior or posterior, or the unsegmented terminal
regions of the embryo (35-37). Although the molecular processes by which
the three groups function are largely different, they share some common fea-
tures: Spatial signals are produced that are localized at the anterior or pos-
terior egg pole. In each group, a series of molecular interactions finally
results in the formation of a transcription factor gradient with the highest
concentration at the site of the localized signal, spanning a substantial por-
tion of the egg length (Figure 2) (38). These transcription factor gradients

   The dorsoventral axis: Two classes of zygotic genes have been identified,
mutation of which cause a dorsalized or ventralized phenotype (39). In
Drosophila, the mesoderm is formed during gastrulation in the ventral region
of the egg, its formation depends on the expression domain of two zygotic
transcription factors. The refinement of the dorsoventral pattern on the dor-
sal side involves a long range signalling process, unlike the series of prepat-
terns of transcription factors observed along the anteroposterior axis (40).
The maternal control of the dorsoventral pattern is achieved by only one
group of genes that establish a nuclear localization gradient, with its maxi-
mum at the ventral side, of a transcription factor that functions both as a
repressor of dorsally expressed genes and an activator of ventrally expressed
genes (17, 19). The first zygotic expression pattern divides the embryo into
at least three domains from dorsal to ventral.

MOLECULAR MECHANISMS OF PATTERN FORMATION

Despite the limitations of the mutant screens discussed above, the collection
of genes within each phenotypic group and thus of components of a devel-
opmental pathway appears to be relatively complete. In several instances,
the molecular interactions of the components within and between pathways
have been elucidated in some detail. These examples show how complex pat-
terns can develop from a small set of independently localized signals. A prin-
cipal mechanism by which spatial complexity is increased is based on con-
centration gradients of morphogens, molecules that elicit different respon-
ses at different concentrations. An example of this mechanism has been dis-
covered by studying the maternal control of the expression pattern of the
gap gene hunchback by the morphogen Bicoid (41-43). Bicoid is the trans-
cription factor determining the anterior pattern, it is distributed in a con-
centration gradient with its maximum at the anterior pole of the egg and
controls the transcription of several target genes in a concentration depen-
dent manner. Morphogen gradients can be formed by diffusion of the pro-
tein translated from a localized mRNA source, as in the case of the anterior
and posterior maternal gradients (Figure 2) (35, 37). In other cases, gradi-
ents are apparently produced by diffusion in the extracellular space (44).
Their spatial distribution is communicated to the interior of the egg cell via
a ligand-receptor based signal transduction mechanism (45). In the case of
the dorsoventral axis, this mechanism results in the formation of a gradient
of nuclear localization of the initially equally distributed transcription factor
Dorsal (46, 47). During segmentation, the series of transcription factor pat-
terns with increasing spatial complexity develops by concentration depen-
dent transcriptional activation and repression, involving combinations of
transcription factors (18). The determination of the final molecular prepat-
tern depends on short range signalling between adjacent cells (48, 34). This
pattern- immediately precedes the first morphological changes occurring
during segment differentiation.

LIMITATIONS OF THE DROSOPHILA SCREENS

The mechanisms by which axes are established in Drosophila are among the
best understood examples of pattern formation to date. Because of some
special features of early development in the Drosophila embryo, they may
however not always have an immediate parallel in other animal classes. This
restriction applies in particular to the processes requiring diffusion in a syn-
cytial embryo, as in the case of the formation of the Bicoid gradient. On the
other hand, examples such as the formation of gradients by diffusion in the
extracellular space, signal transduction, and the establishment of a nuclear
localization gradient, as in the case of Dorsal, may prove to have analogies in
pattern forming processes in multicellular tissues. The genetic analysis of
pattern formation in Drosophila teaches us about the logic of pattern forma-
tion in a complex system, it also led to the discovery of some basic mech-

THE ZEBRAFISH SCREEN

The zebrafish, Danio rerio, was selected as a model with potential for geneti-
cal research by the late George Streisinger (28). In the past 20 years a num-
ber of useful methods have been developed for the breeding and genetic
analysis, as well as for the investigation of embryonic development of the
zebrafish (25-27). It is interesting to compare flies and fishes regarding
their properties for genetic and embryological research. Obviously, the long
generation time and space requirement for rearing of zebrafish make large
scale genetic screens difficult. In addition because of technical and logistical
problems in the running of large numbers of aquaria, working with fish is
more costly and labor intensive than with flies. On the other hand; com-
pared to mice, the more traditional vertebrate organism used in genetical
research, zebrafish offers the advantages of extrauterine development, and
high fecundity. In fish, in vitro fertilization, haploid development of embryos
until the larval stage, diploidisation, and the freezing of sperm samples is
possible (Tablel). These techniques are invaluable in the maintenance and
analysis of a large number of mutants, and are not available for flies. The
greatest advantage of the zebrafish, however, lies in the nature of its embry-
onic development. Zebrafish eggs are fertilized synchronously, they develop
rapidly outside the maternal organism, and, most importantly, they are ini-
tially completely transparent. This allows the observation of the develop-
ment of many tissues and organs directly in the living embryo and at subse-
quent stages without the necessity of fixing, clearing and staining (55)
(Figure 4) .
   The early embryogenesis of zebrafish is very different from that of flies. A
period of rapid synchronous cleavages results in a three-dimensional mass of
cells, unlike the two-dimensional blastoderm formed in the Drosophila
embryo. Gastrulation in the fish involves several morphogenetic move-
ments, such as involution of mesendodermal regions and dorsal conver-
gence (55). Although appearing very different, these movements might be
related to the invagination of mesodermal and endodermal anlagen, and
ventral condensation and extension of the germ band in the Drosophila
embryo. They result in a multilayered embryo, the pharyngula or phylotypic
stage, displaying the typical vertebrate body organization (Figure 4).
   While in the Drosophila embryo fate mapping studies allow the construc-
tion of two-dimensional maps of the early gastrula with distinct and clearly
separated anlagen, in the fish the fate of cells within particular gastrula
regions is much less precisely predictable. The fish gastrula is multilayered.
Large regions from which different organs or tissues later develop are over-
lapping and superimposed. This difference may reflect quite distinct devel-
opmental mechanisms determining fate of cells in the fish and fly embryo.
A comparison of a fly and fish fate map reveals further dramatic differences
between the relative size occupied by the anlagen for various organs: for

example in the fish the brain anlage occupies a very large fraction of the
gastrula, while the epidermis is rather inconspicuous, compared to its
dominance in the fly map. To a certain extent, the sizes of the anlagen reflect
the importance and visibility of the structures that can be scored in a mutant
screen.
   The crossing scheme used to make mutants with phenotypes visible in the
embryo or early fish larva is displayed in Figure 1. For the fish, ENU treat-
ment of spermatogonia has been used with a similar efficiency of mutagene-
sis as that obtained by EMS treatment of sperm in the fly (about 1 mutation
per gene per 1000 genomes) (26). In contrast to the fly screens, in the fish
no markers can be used to help distinguishing carrier from non carrier fish
in the F2. Therefore, in order to detect a mutation induced by the treatment
of parental males, a number of crosses have to be set up, of which only 25%
on average yield progeny that are homozygous for a mutation. As fish hatch
enzymatically, most homozygous mutant embryos also hatch, and therefore,
with few exceptions, cannot be selected as nonhatchers, a useful way to iden-

tify mutant embryos in the Drosophila screens. Mutant fish embryos can be
recognized by their phenotypes only. The lack of markers and preselection is
compensated somewhat by the fact that the entire genome is scored at once,
and not chromosome by chromosome. In the case of the fly, three separate
screens, using a total of more than 20000 inbred families, were performed, to
obtain about 600 mutants in 130 genes (9-l 1). In the fish 3100 families were
screened, with an average of 4.2 crosses, corresponding to the screening of
3800 genomes (Figure 1) (29). As the breeding of such a large number of
fish families is necessary to achieve a reasonable degree of saturation for any
given phenotypic trait, this screen was done as a collaborative effort of 12
scientists. We screened as many different phenotypic traits as could be effci-
ently scored. We isolated a total of 1200 mutants, of which to date about 900
have been characterized both phenotypically and genetically. They define
350 genes, of which 150 have more than one allele (29).
   The different features of development of the fish embryo were scored at
different times in development, as the structures and organs become visible
with age (Figure 4). On the second day of development, the somites, noto-
chord and brain were scored, while after hatching heart, blood, musculatu-
re, fins, eye, ear and other features can be studied. Fish of the larval stage,
the latest time scored, almost one week old, have developed a complete set
of internal organs, liver, gut, pancreas, kidney, can see and respond to sti-
muli, and are pigmented with three types of pigment cells. They still display
a pigment pattern characteristic for the larval stage, and the fin structure
does not yet completely correspond to that of the adult fish (Figure 4).
There are structural features of the fish which are recognized with safety and
ease, while others are less conspicuous and therefore abnormalities may not
always have been detected. The large degree of complexity, which is far more
than that displayed in the cuticular pattern of the fly larva, allows a much
broader spectrum of organs and tissues to be investigated, but it also poses
considerable demands on the skill and expertise of the experimenter. The
recognition of a particular phenotype is greatly enhanced if an interpreta-
tion of the phenotype is available, or if it has been seen before. Many
mutants have rather general defects, they have not been kept for analysis
(29). Mutants with complex or subtle phenotypes resembling rather general
defects are not always recognized as interesting, or interpreted correctly.
This means that the degree of saturation varies among different phenotypic
classes (Table 3). On average it is certainly less than that achieved in the fly
screens.
   According to their predominant phenotypic traits, the genes can be clas-
sified in a large number of groups with similar phenotypes. Classification of
each mutant depends on the interpretation placed on its phenotype, and
this in turn on the degree of phenotypic analysis that can be performed. In
the fish, a number of molecular probes are available that serve as markers for
particular regions at specific developmental times. The expression patterns
of such markers were very useful in characterizing many of the mutant phe-

notypes. The classes of fish genes identified by the mutants are shown in
Table 3. A small number of classes have a parallel among the classes of fly
genes, while the majority of phenotypes are novel. The collection of the fish
gene classes is so different from that of the fly genes that a comparison is pos-
sible only in selected cases. Regarding the most prominent fly gene classes,
gastrulation and segmentation, however, a small number of fish genes might
reveal similarities to fly processes.

THE ZEBRAFISH GENE CLASSES

Gastrulation is affected in two gene groups, the phenotypes of which display
a partial dorsalisation or ventralisation (56, 57). In dino mutant embryos,
dorsal anterior structures are reduced, while ventral posterior structures are
increased in size. This results in embryos with small heads and large tails.
The effect is most pronounced in the structures derived from the ventral-
most position in the fate map: the blood and ventral tail fin, that is increased
in size in dino. Using molecular markers that are expressed before gastrula-
tion in a polar manner, it is apparent that the fate map is distorted already at
an early point in fish embryogenesis (Figure 5A). As suggested by a charac-
teristic duplication of the ventral tail fin, mutants in the mercedes gene have a
role in the same process (56) (F i ure 5K). A phenotype complementary to
that of dino and mercedes is displayed in mutants in a number of genes with
a dorsalized phenotype. Swirl embryos, for example, have much enlarged

reduced or lacking entirely (57). These groups of genes are reminiscent of
genes with dorsalizing and ventralizing phenotypes also observed in
Drosophila. For genes of both groups, homologs in the frog and fish have
been cloned and shown to be expressed at opposite regions of the blastula
(58-61). These and other observations led to the revival of an old theory,
postulating that the orientation of the dorsoventral axis in invertebrates is
inverted compared to that of vertebrates (62-64). The fish genes are likely to
provide components in these conserved pathways.
   An interest in the mechanism of segmentation in vertebrates was an
important incentive for the mutant screens in fish. In contrast to flies, which
have a clearly segmented ectoderm, the mesoderm is the primary vertebrate
tissue that is organized in a metameric pattern. We did not find many genes
in the fish that have similarities to fly segmentation genes. The closest are
mutants in which the somites, the earliest visible repetitive structures formed
in the fish embryo after 10h of development, are fused. Five genes have a
phenotype with fused somites (Figure 5 B, M, N) (65). The somite pattern in
the fish embryo is much less complex than the segment pattern of the
Drosophila larva. However, the vertebrae that develop in postlarval stages in
mutant fish display characteristic mirror duplications (Figure 5N), albeit less
striking and regular than the phenotypes of the segment polarity genes in
the fly, with which they may be compared. No genes with obvious resem-
blance to gap or pair rule genes have been detected in the fish screens. Using
molecular approaches, no clear homologs to the gap genes could be de-
tected so far, and the homologs of the pair rule genes do not seem to be
expressed in a pair rule fashion (59). The failure to find mutations resem-
bling the gap and pair rule mutations in the fish may mean that the forma-
tion of metameric patterns differs between Drosophila and most other ani-
mals. On the other hand, it may be the result of redundancy.
   Other mutations affect the dorsoventral subdivision of the somites by the
horizontal myoseptum. Some of these also lack the notochord, while in
others the notochord is apparently normal. The notochord is a vertebrate-
specific structure. The gene no tail , a fish homolog of the mouse brachyury or
T gene, is expressed in the notochord (Figure 5C) (66, 67) (a homolog in
Drosophila is expressed in the hindgut (68)); and mutations in no tail as well
as in three other genes required for notochord formation have been identi-
fied (Figure 5C) (69, 70). The structure of the somites in fish is thought to
be dependent on signals derived from the notochord. The genes affecting
somite subdivision by the horizontal myoseptum might represent members
of these signalling processes (Figure 5G). Their products may be involved in
producing or receiving the signals, respectively (65). For these genes, homo-
logous processes in Drosophila are not obvious.
   A large number of the fish genes affect structures and functions of the
central nervous system and sensory organs (Table 3). This class is poorly
represented in the fly screen. In our screen several aspects of CNS develop-
ment have been scored. For the neurogenic genes of Drosophila, such as Notch

and Delta, homologs have been detected in the vertebrate by molecular
means (71) and in our screen at least one gene with neurogenic features,
white tail, has been found. Mutant embryos display a considerable multipli-
cation of primary neurons at the expense of secondary neurons and certain
types of glial cells (Figure 5E) (72). Another class of genes affect structures
along the midline in all three germlayers. In the mutants, the eyes are often
fused. Mutant embryos display a lack of structures derived from axial meso-
derm and ventral regions of the spinal cord or brain. In some mutants the
pathfinding of nerves across the midline is impaired. The most prominent
and longest known representative of this class of genes is cyclops (73). The
eyes of mutant embryos are fused anteriorly, and the floorplate, the ventral
region of the spinal cord, is lacking. There are several new members of this
class of genes including diwanka (Figure 5H) and chameleon (74). It will be
interesting to see whether the mutations which delete the midline structures,
the ventral portion of the neuroectoderm and head in Drosophila, such as
spitz and others (75) are homologous to the fish midline genes.
   The brain morphology is affected in a number of mutants of which only
some will be mentioned here. The forebrain, including the olfactory placo-
des and eyes are deleted in the mutant masterblind (Figure 5D). The analysis
with molecular markers revealed that the region which normally would devel-
op forebrain, instead develops into more posterior structures, similar to a
homeotic transformation (76). The midbrain-hindbrain boundary is absent
in mutants of two genes, no isthmus and acerebellal. The no isthmus gene,
(Figure 5L) which is also required for the formation of the kidney, is homo-
logous to one of the pax genes, a family of genes first identified in the mouse
by their homology to the Drosophila segmentation gene paired (77).
   A large number of zebrafish mutant classes do not have parallels in our
Drosophila mutant collection. They will only be summarized briefly here. Of
particular interest regarding their potential for medical research are mutants
affecting inner organs. A number of genes affecting blood formation and cir-
culation as well as the heart, structures easily storable in the first two days of
embryogenesis of the fish, have been identified. Mutants affected in organs
developing later, such as liver, pancreas and kidney, are less well represented.
Differentiation defects or degeneration of the musculature are displayed in
embryos mutant for a number of genes. In addition, sensory organs such as
eye and ear (Figure 5I), are affected in other mutants. A large number of
genes are required for the formation of structures derived from the neural
crest. The largest class are genes required for pigmentation, that is pigment
cell formation and pigment pattern, and a number of genes affect portions
of the jaw (Figure 50) or branchial arches, structures specific to vertebrates
(Table 3). We also isolated mutants with specific defects in motility of the
larva. Mutant larvae fail to respond to touch, show reduced or no motility,
spastic or circling behaviour, as well as defects in the reciprocal inhibition
across the midline of muscular contractions. In a small number of mutants,
defects in the outgrowth of motoneurons were observed (78). In Drosophila,

our screens did not permit the. recovery of motility mutants, although immo-
tile larval phenotypes could be recognized in principle by an abnormal dis-
tortion of the larval cuticle in the unhatched embryo. Fortuitously, a small
group of 4 genes of Drosophila was detected in which larvae were hyperactive,
sometimes turning around in the egg case (Table 2) (9-11). These pheno-
types in addition showed defective head skeleton differentiation, to this
day they are not analyzed in detail.


CONCLUSIONS

Genetical research on axis determination in the Drosophila embryo has pro-
vided perhaps the most complete understanding of pattern formation to
date. The elegance and efficiency with which mutations can be isolated and
genes can be manipulated in this organism will permit further important dis-
coveries concerning a number of basic processes of cell and developmental
biology. However, mechanisms in the fly are, in several instances, likely to be
unique to this specialized organism. While the approach of using fly genes to
find homologs in vertebrates is a very powerful one, it emphasizes the simi-
larities between these clearly different organisms. To understand vertebrate
development, genes specific to vertebrates must be investigated in addition
to those common between flies and fishes. To find and elucidate these diffe-
rences, the mutants discovered in the zebrafish will provide an important
entry point from which fundamental biological and medical problems might
be investigated with genetical tools.
