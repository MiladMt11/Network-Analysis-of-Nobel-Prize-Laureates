The story of telomerase discovery is a story of the thrill of putting pieces of
a puzzle together to find something new. This story represents a paradigm
for curiosity-driven research and, like many other stories of fundamental
discovery, shows that important clinical insights can come from unlikely places.
In this paper I describe the process of scientific discovery – at times
frustrating, at times misleading and perplexing, but yet also at times wonder-
fully exciting. The willingness to keep an open mind, to enter uncharted
waters and try something new, along with patience and determination, came
together to tell us something new about biology. Fundamentally this story
shows how curiosity and an interest in solving interesting problems can lead
to a lifetime of exciting discoveries.


Identifying the puzzle: telomere sequences defined
Telomeres posed a puzzle for biologists for a many years: it was clear that
a chromosome end differed from a chromosome break – but how? In the
1930s, Herman Muller and Barbara McClintock showed that natural chromo-
some ends have special properties that afforded their protection; they coined
the word telomere to describe these natural chromosome ends, deriving the
word from the Greek telo = end and mere = part (McClintock, 1939, 1941;
Muller, 1938). The puzzle of how these ends functioned remained unsolved
for many years, until their molecular structure was characterized.
   In 1978, Blackburn and Gall identified the first telomere sequence using
the ciliate Tetrahymena, which contains 40,000 telomeres. They found that
the chromosome end was made up of tandem, consecutive repeats of the
simple sequence CCCCAA (Blackburn and Gall, 1978). Their discovery of
this simple repeated sequence turned out to be the key to understanding
telomere function.
   The identification of tandem repeats in the telomeres of Tetrahymena was
followed by the identification of similar repeats in the telomeres of other
organisms, including Oxytricha, Physarum, yeast, and trypanosomes (Bernards
et al., 1983; Boswell et al., 1982; Johnson, 1980; Szostak and Blackburn, 1982).
This conservation of telomere sequence across a wide variety of organisms

suggested that telomere function might also be similar in these species.
This conservation also suggested that telomeres and their function – of
maintaining chromosome ends, and hence protecting them from destruction
– arose early in evolution, such that all species with linear chromosomes
evolved with the same ancestral mechanism of maintenance, albeit with some
variation.


Curious facts about telomeres: some pieces of the puzzle
Liz Blackburn and others were interested to know how the simple repeats
functioned as telomeres to confer protection upon a chromosome end. Soon
after the telomere sequence was first identified, several curious facts about
telomeres were uncovered. First, telomeres were heterogeneous in length:
in a population of cells, different chromosome ends possessed telomeres
comprising different numbers of repeats (Blackburn and Gall, 1978). How
was this established? When a population of telomeres was digested using
restriction enzymes it generated so-called “fuzzy bands” when the digest was
separated using agarose gel electrophoresis (Figure 1). Why was this? The
variable-length telomeres had generated heterogeneous fragment lengths,
which all migrated to slightly different positions on the agarose gel, yielding
blurred (or ‘fuzzy’) bands, rather than the sharper, more distinct bands that
are typical of restriction fragments which are all of a similar size.

A second curious fact was that the telomeres in trypanosomes grew longer as
the cells were grown in culture (Bernards et al., 1983). The same surprising
result was found when similar experiments were performed with Tetrahymena:
when kept in continuous log phase growth, the telomere fragments grew
progressively (Larson et al., 1987) (Figure 1). This elongation was unexpected.
In fact, it was the opposite of what had been predicted on the basis
of published models for telomere replication. In 1974, James Watson
suggested that a linear chromosome should get shorter as cells divided, based
on the mechanism by which DNA polymerase replicates DNA during cell
division (Watson, 1972). A similar idea was also proposed by Alexi Olovinkov,
who suggested that chromosome ends might shorten after rounds of DNA
replication (Greider, 1998; Olovnikov, 1973). Why, then, were the telomeres
getting longer? And why were they fuzzy?


Collecting more pieces of the puzzle: telomere sequence
addition
When Liz Blackburn and Jack Szostak met for the first time at a conference,
they were both interested in DNA ends. They knew about the curious
structure of telomeres and their elongation, and they saw a way to use
these puzzle pieces to perform a long-shot experiment: they decided to test
whether Tetrahymena telomeres could function as telomeres in yeast. The
experiment was a long shot because these two species are very distantly
related, having diverged from a common ancestor millions of years ago.
Despite being a long-shot it was an experiment they could do, so they forged
ahead.
   Blackburn and Szostak took a circular yeast plasmid and cut it once
with a restriction enzyme to make it linear. Jack knew from his earlier
experiments in yeast that this linear DNA would be rapidly degraded if put
into yeast cells. However, they wondered whether the addition of Tetrahymena
telomeres to this linear DNA would cause the ends to be protected – as
they are in Tetrahymena – so preventing the normal rapid degradation of
the DNA when transformed into (that is, added to) yeast cells. Liz purified
the Tetrahymena telomeres and Jack ligated them onto the linearized yeast
plasmid (Figure 2). When this construct was transformed into yeast, it was
stable: it replicated and was maintained as a linear chromosome fragment.
   This maintenance of the linear plasmid was a stunning result: it indi-
cated that the Tetrahymena telomeres functioned and protected DNA ends
in yeast, a very distantly-related organism (Szostak and Blackburn, 1982).
Emboldened by this success, Liz and Jack took one step further forward;
they devised a method to identify the naturally occurring yeast telomere
sequence. Instead of attaching Tetrahymena telomeres to the linear plasmid,
they set out to find the parts of the yeast genome that protect and maintain
the linear plasmid, and which therefore contain the yeast telomere.
To do this, they removed one end of the linear plasmid to which Tetrahymena
telomeres had been added, and ligated random genomic fragments of yeast

DNA to this free end. Those random fragments that harbored a telomere
allowed stable maintenance of the linear plasmid.
   In doing these experiments, Liz and Jack noticed another curious fact:
the Tetrahymena telomeres on the plasmid maintained in yeast were longer
than they had started out. They were curious to know why. So, together with
Janice Shampay, they set out to sequence the cloned yeast telomeres and
the Tetrahymena telomere end. When they sequenced the yeast telomere
they found it to have the same kind of tandemly-repeated sequences as had
been found in all other organisms so far. More strikingly, determining the
sequence of the Tetrahymena telomeres from the linear plasmid showed why
they were longer: the initial Tetrahymena telomeres had been extended by
terminal addition of yeast-specific sequences. (Shampay et al., 1984) (Figure

   This last puzzle piece was a very important one. Models of telomere
maintenance and elongation had been proposed, which involved telomere-
telomere recombination (Figure 3a). Even though Jack’s expertise lay in
understanding these recombination models, both he and Liz recognized
that the addition of yeast-specific sequences onto the Tetrahymena ends could
not really be explained by those models. Instead, the data suggested to Liz
and Jack the existence of an active elongation mechanism in yeast, whereby
DNA was generated de novo rather than being the result of a recombination
event (Figure 3b). They wrote in their paper, “We propose that terminal
transferase-like enzymes are responsible for extending the 3’ G+T rich strand
of yeast telomeres.” By continually following the clues (and keeping an open
mind) they had come to the conclusion that no known enzyme could do the
sequence addition, and so proposed instead that there must be an unknown
enzyme that adds telomere sequences.

Figure 3. Two models for telomere elongation.
A) Recombination can elongate telomeres. Since telomeric repeats are homologous on
all chromosome ends a short telomere may copy off of a long telomere in a gene-conver-
sion type of recombination. The 3’ end of the short telomere base pairs with the longer
telomere and polymerase extends the end of their strand. The other strand can be cop-
ied by conventional polymerase activity. This results in the net elongation of the short
telomere, while the long telomere remains long. B) Alternative model for telomere
elongation proposes that de novo elongation lengthens telomeres. The discovery of

Looking for telomere elongation: defining the edges of
the puzzle
When I joined Liz’s lab in May of 1984 I set out to look for this unknown
enzyme. We decided to use biochemistry to see if we could identify an
enzyme that might elongate telomeres. There was no established protocol
for finding an unknown enzyme, so we had fun and made one up. In
fact, more precisely, we continually made up new protocols. It was like
biochemical improvisation: we started with one concept of an assay that
might allow detection of addition onto telomeres, but kept modifying the
assay after each set of experiments. We changed the reaction conditions,
the substrates, and even method of detection. After nine months we found
something (!) and so we had another piece of the puzzle. But how did our
nine-month search for this puzzle piece unfold?

the Fragment 2 with the telomeric end would be preferentially labeled (Left bottom pan-
el). The actual results showed that both ends were equally labeled (Right bottom panel),
prompting a revision of the assay.

First we needed an assay – a way to detect if telomere elongation was
happening. The first assay we tried explored whether a piece of DNA that
included a telomere would incorporate DNA precursors more readily than a
piece of DNA containing non-telomeric sequences. The idea was that if there
was an enzyme that actively elongated telomeres, we might be able to detect
it through its activity in association with telomere DNA. For this assay, we de-
veloped a substrate that was meant to mimic a telomere in the cell: a linear
DNA fragment that contained a telomeric sequence at one end but not at
the other (Figure 4). I incubated this linear fragment of DNA with the nucle-
otides dA, dC, dG and dT – the building blocks of DNA – the dC and dG
had been labeled with the radioactive isotope 32P. We reasoned that an elon-
gation enzyme might preferentially elongate the end of the DNA fragment
that contained the telomeres; if it did, we expected to see more of the 32P
label incorporated into the telomeric end than the end lacking a telomere.
   I incubated the linear DNA substrate in an extract made from Tetrahymena
nuclei. The extract was prepared in a manner that we hoped would allow all
of the enzymes normally present in the nuclei to be active. We also added
radiolabeled dCTP and dGTP and unlabeled dATP and dCTP to serve as
DNA precursors. After incubation for an hour, I purified the linear fragment
from the extract to examine what had happened to the ends. Following
its purification, I cut the DNA fragment to generate two unequal sized
fragments to distinguish between the telomeric and non-telomeric ends.
(The smaller of the two pieces contained the telomere end.) We could then
separate and identify the two different-sized fragments on an agarose gel.
   After separating the two pieces by size, we exposed the gel to X-ray film,
because the fragments that had incorporated the 32P-labeled precursor
would generate a dark band on the film and we could thus identify them.
We then looked to see if there was more radioactive label incorporated in
the fragment that had the telomere end than the non-telomere end (Figure
4). Unfortunately, no matter how we prepared the extract, both fragments
always incorporated similar amounts of label. We knew we needed a different
way to approach this problem.


A puzzle-solving strategy: getting the assay right
The most productive way to solve a puzzle is to attack it with the right
strategy. Since we did not know precisely what we were looking for, we tested
a number of different approaches to see which plan might be successful.
After each experiment, we thought of new changes to make to the next
experiment. Two of the many changes we tried proved important: using
sequencing gels to resolve the DNA fragments after incubation, and using
synthetic oligonucleotides as telomere substrates instead of large restric-
tion fragments. How did these two changes affect the outcome of the
experiments?
   After our initial attempts that I’ve described above, we sat and puzzled
about the fact that both the telomere end and the non-telomere end showed

                                                                            303


incorporation of the radioactive label. We realized that exonucleases, which
were expected to be present in the extract, were likely generating some
single-stranded DNA within the linear DNA fragment; repair polymerases
would then fill out the single strand region, causing radioactive label to be
incorporated into both ends of the fragment.
   We thought hard about a way to get around this problem. First, we changed
the approach: rather than looking for increased label incorporation, we
decided to look for changes in the size of the fragment. If there was an
enzyme that extended telomeres not only should the telomeres become
labeled with the radioactive precursors, but also the size of the fragment
should increase as the telomere is extended. (The repair polymerases in
the extracts, which could cause both telomere and non-telomere ends to be
labeled would not be capable of generating DNA that was longer than the
fragments added at the start of the assay.)
   To see a change in size of a fragment we needed to have a short fragment:
a small change in size of a large fragment would be too hard to detect, but
a small change in size of a very small fragment would be noticeable. We
repeated the experiment as described above but, when cutting the fragment,
made the cut very close to the telomere end to generate a telomere fragment
just 34 base pairs long. The non-telomere and telomere fragments were
then separated on a gel that was usually used for DNA sequence analysis and
which could distinguish between fragments that differed in length by just a
single base.
   I worked from May through December trying different variations of this
experiment, staring hard at the sequencing gels but never quite convincing
myself there was much of a change in fragment size. So, in December of 1984,
we decided to make another change to the assay: we changed the substrate
that we were adding to the reaction. Instead of a long linear DNA fragment,
I tested a synthetic 18 residue oligonucleotide (TTGGGG)4 as the substrate.
Eric Henderson, a postdoctoral fellow in the lab, was studying the unusual
structure of DNA oligonucleotides made of these G-rich telomere sequences,
and offered some of his synthetic oligonucleotide, which I decided to use
instead of the DNA restriction fragment to see if it might be elongated.

elongation of telomeric primer. Extracts from a time course of Tetrahymena development
were made at different numbers of hours of development (indicated at top by hours).
Extracts were also made from vegetatively growing cells (marked Veg). The banding
pattern represents the six base repeat of TTGGGG that is added to the primer. This
autoradiogram was the first experiment in which telomerase activity was seen on December
25, 1984.


So, I set out to examine the elongation of the telomeric oligonucle-
otide. I made cell extracts from Tetrahymena and incubated them with the
oligonucleotide and radiolabeled nucleotide precursors (Figure 5A). It
took over a week to set up the experiment, do the reactions, and then run
the sequencing gel. To maximize the signal generated by the radioactive
label, I exposed the gel to X-ray film for three days. When I went to the
lab to develop the X-ray film, I was thrilled to see a repeating pattern of
elongation products that extended up the gel. (Figure 5B). The
oligonucleotide substrate was being elongated to give products that varied in
size by six bases, giving the repeating pattern seen on the gel. This was the
first visualization of telomerase activity.


Testing ourselves: do the pieces really fit, or are we
forcing them?
   I talked to Liz the next day and showed her the gel. We were both talking
at the same time, trying to understand the meaning of the repeating pat-

                                                                                   305


tern. We knew that this could be the result of the enzymatic activity we were
looking for, but we also wanted to be sure the pattern we were seeing was
indeed generated by a novel enzyme. Were we truly seeing something new, or
was our own wishful thinking coloring our interpretation of the result?
   To be sure we were not forcing the interpretation of the elongation
pattern, we set out to test various alternative explanations that might
generate a repeating pattern like the one we were seeing. For example,
we thought the TTGGGG primer might be annealing to double-stranded
genomic DNA that might be present as a contaminant, such that a
conventional polymerase could generate the TTGGGG repeat addition
when replicating the DNA (Figure 6A). Alternatively, the primer might be
self-annealing (that is, pairs of the primer might be sticking to one another),
generating a double-stranded substrate for a conventional polymerase to
copy (Figure 6B).
   To address these and other concerns, we devised an ever-evolving set of
control experiments to determine if the repeat addition was the result of
the activity of a previously identified enzyme. For one control, we treated
the samples with aphidicolin, which inhibits conventional DNA polymerases.
More importantly, we used a CCCCAA primer, which would be expected to
be elongated if simple copying of telomere repeats by DNA polymerase was
occurring (rather than nucleotides being added de novo). The fact that the
CCCCAA primer was not elongated ruled out the trivial explanation that the
repeating pattern was coming from the copying of endogenous DNA.
   These were exciting times. Once I could repeatedly see the primer elonga-
tion activity, it was fun to test various ideas about how it might be generated.
I would come in to the lab every day, eager to test the next set of experiments
and find something new. The final experiment that convinced both Liz and
me that we had something new was when we did the converse of the experi-
ment that Liz and Jack Szostak had done, which had been published in Cell
in 1982. They had put Tetrahymena telomeres into yeast cells and shown that
a yeast telomeric sequence was added to the ends. By contrast, we made
a synthetic yeast sequence telomere oligonucleotide primer and put it in
Tetrahymena extracts – and found that the Tetrahymena telomere repeats were
added to the yeast telomere.

How could we tell that Tetrahymena and not yeast telomere repeats were
being added? The yeast sequence primer had three Gs at the end, while the
Tetrahymena telomere sequence had four. The banding pattern of sequences
added onto the yeast primer was one base longer than would have been the
case if the yeast sequence had been repeated: this extra base was the extra

                                                                                                  307


G required to complete the GGGG found in the Tetrahymena sequence. This
result was quite stunning. The shift in banding pattern convinced us a new
enzyme was in action: we could not imagine how conventional polymerases
would elongate a yeast sequence with Tetrahymena repeats. We wrote up
the paper, which was published in Cell in December of 1985 (Greider and
Blackburn, 1985).


The next part of the puzzle: sequence information
The next big question was where the information for the addition of
TTGGGG repeats was coming from. Liz and I talked through several
different models. The one I wanted most to test was that there might be an
RNA component that specifies the sequences added to the chromosome
end. I set out to do an experiment to pre-treat the extract with either DNase
(which would digest DNA) or RNase (which would digest RNA) or nothing
(as a control) to see if this pre-treatment affected the activity of telomerase.
On the day of this experiment, Tom Cech, who had a long-standing interest
in both telomeres and RNA, was visiting Berkeley to give a seminar. Liz and I
met with Tom in the morning and described my idea of seeing whether the
activity would be sensitive to treatment with RNase. He agreed that was an
interesting experiment.
  Throughout the day, as Tom was being escorted around the department
from appointment to appointment, he would stop by the lab and see how
the experiment was going. We found that pre-treatment of the Tetrahymena
extract with RNase did indeed block the elongation activity. Establishing
that RNA was needed for elongation was a key clue: it allowed us to think
about possible mechanisms by which the enzyme would specify the TTGGGG
repeats that were added.


Following the clues: is there a template?
The inactivation of telomerase by RNase treatment suggested a clear
hypothesis: the TTGGGG repeats are made by copying from an RNA
template, which is a component of the functioning telomerase. The most
powerful way to test the validity of this hypothesis was to find the actual RNA
template. To isolate a component of telomerase, we needed first to purify
the enzyme from all of the other proteins present in the crude extract. I
established a multistep purification protocol for telomerase, using
conventional column chromatography (Figure 7A). I would separate the
extract into fractions and test each fraction for activity (to identify the
fraction containing telomerase). I would then take the active fractions and
subject them to another, different separation step. I used size exclusion, ion
exchange, dye binding, and heparin binding columns to successively purify
telomerase (Figure 7B). I then examined the active fraction to look for an
RNA that was always present when telomerase was active. I purified the
RNAs from active fractions, and labeled them with 32P (Figure 7C); we then

narrowed down the likely candidates by determining which RNAs
reproducibly co-purified with telomerase.

We then faced our next challenge: we needed to have the sequence of
the RNA component to determine if a template mechanism was, indeed,
working. We tried a number of different methods to obtain the RNA
sequence, including the very newly developed method termed PCR
(polymerase chain reaction), which we had heard about but which had not
yet even been published.
  After trying to obtain a sequence for a number of months, I decided to
take a more direct approach: I used direct RNA sequencing techniques
to determine a partial sequence from those RNAs that emerged as good
candidates. To do this, the RNAs of interest were cut out of a high-resolution

gel and sequenced. This sequencing revealed that the very small RNAs that
co‑purified with telomerase activity were, in fact, tRNA contaminants that
were present in the active fractions due to the high abundance of tRNA
in the cell. For example, I sequenced one RNA that ran near a marker of
175 bases and found it was related to 7SL RNA, an RNA that had recently
been associated with the signal recognition particle involved in ribosome
function. Finding known RNAs was somewhat reassuring as it told us that
the sequencing technique was working. However, it was somewhat of a
disappointment as we were hoping to identify a new RNA that might provide
the template for telomerase.
   One RNA that I had my eye on after staring at many different purifica-
tion experiments ran near the 154 base marker. No single experiment had
pinpointed this RNA as the best candidate; my interest was really a hunch
since I had seen this RNA repeatedly in many experiments. I decided to test
thus hunch, however this “154 base RNA” as I referred to it proved harder to
sequence. I was able to obtain only partial sequence from different regions
of the RNA, but none of the partial sequences contained a telomere repeat
as expected for a template and the full length RNA proved impossible to
sequence.
   All of the accumulated evidence indicated there must be a template in
telomerase, but we did not have the final key piece of the puzzle. Since
telomerase was an interesting enzyme and our experiments clearly suggested
that an RNA was involved, we decided to write a paper about what we knew
about telomerase, despite not having the actual RNA in hand. We wrote
the paper on the biochemical characterization of telomerase and the fact
that there was likely an RNA component; it was published in Cell in 1987
(Greider and Blackburn, 1987). Looking back it is now clear that many of
the experiments in this paper that helped to characterize telomerase served
as the basis for identifying telomerase in other organisms. After the
identification of Tetrahymena telomerase, telomerase enzymes from other
organisms such as Euplotes, Oxytricha and humans were characterized by
other groups (Lingner and Cech, 1996; Lingner et al., 1994; Morin, 1989;

A change in venue: seeing the puzzle from a different per-
spective
I finished my Ph.D. at Berkeley in November 1987 and took a position as
an independent fellow at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in January 1988.
At Cold Spring Harbor I was still focused on identifying the RNA, but my
exploration took a different approach. Rather than continuing with more
RNA sequencing, I decided to see if I could clone the RNA gene directly
from the partial sequence information that I had already obtained.
   I designed several different oligonucleotide probes that were comple-
mentary to the regions of partial RNA sequence I had obtained, and made
size- selected genomic libraries that were enriched for sequences that

310


hybridized to these oligonucleotides. After a number of attempts, I obtained
one clone that possessed both the correct partial sequence and the sequence
CAACCCCAA. Seeing this sequence on the sequencing gel was exciting, as
it mirrored what would be expected if a template mechanism for TTGGGG
addition was indeed used by telomerase. This clone was clearly a central
puzzle piece. I went on to verify that this RNA was expressed in Tetrahymena
and was around 160 nucleotides in length. All the signs were that my earlier
hunch about “154 base RNA” being a key player in telomerase activity had
been right.


Is this the right puzzle piece?
It was exhilarating to have the sequence of an RNA that might encode the
RNA component of telomerase in hand. But I needed some evidence that
this RNA was indeed the template. Again, just as when we were trying to
first identify telomerase, there was no precedent for the experiments I was
trying to do. It was fun to be creative and dream up ways to test whether this
RNA was the right candidate. I talked to my friends at Cold Spring Harbor,
listened to their advice and read about other enzymes and about how
functional RNAs were identified.
   My next step in characterizing telomerase activity was to test the
function of my candidate RNA template. To do this, I decided to use
the oligonucleotides I had used in the cloning experiments, which were
complementary to telomerase. I thought that if I could inactivate the enzyme
by specifically cleaving the candidate RNA, I would have strong evidence
for the involvement of this specific RNA in telomerase activity. I think it
was Adrian Krainer, a colleague at CSH, who suggested using RNase H in
this experiment. RNase H is a specific RNase that will cleave the RNA of a
DNA/RNA duplex. The thought was that, if the oligonucleotide hybridized
specifically to regions of complementary RNA in telomerase, and subsequent
RNase H cleavage inactivated the telomerase, we would have evidence for
the involvement of the RNA to which the oligonucleotide had hybridized in
telomerase-mediated telomere elongation (Figure 8).

cleaved in the middle leaving the two RNA halves intact.

As is often the case in science, unexpected results provided the most
important puzzle pieces. The RNase H experiment relied on the
oligonucleotide having access to the RNA to be able to hybridize with it, even
when the RNA is bound by telomerase proteins. As this wasn’t always the case,
some of the oligonucleotides had no effect. However, two oligonucleotides
did give completely unexpected results. Incubation of telomerase with Oligo
3 inactivated telomerase even before RNase H was added, while, amazingly,
incubation of telomerase with Oligo 8 resulted in elongation of Oligo 8 itself
(Figure 9). I had to sit and think about what this meant.
   At first it was frustrating: if telomerase was already being inactivated by
Oligo3 and adding RNase H had no further effect, how could I do the experi-
ment? This frustration soon faded when, having talked about this result with
my friends and puzzling more, I realized there was a much more interesting
explanation for these results. I had fortuitously found additional evidence
of a role for the 159 nucleotide RNA in the telomerase reaction. Oligo 3 was
unique in that it hybridized to my 159 nt RNA in a region adjacent to the
template region and also across it (Figure 9A). When anchored to the RNA
by hybridization, this oligonucleotide would block binding of the TTGGGG
oligonucleotide substrate, and thus block telomerase activity (Figure 9B).

312


Subsequent work showed that RNase H would cleave the 159 nt RNA when
incubated with Oligo 3, showing that Oligo 3 does indeed hybridize to the 159
nt RNA as part of telomerase.
   The other unusual puzzle piece was Oligo8. This oligonucleotide shared
sequence similarity with Oligo3 but its 3' end stopped just before the
template region. This oligonucleotide also hybridized to the 159 nt RNA
and the 3' end was positioned in exactly the right place for it to be elongated
by telomerase (Figure 9A). This implied that the CAACCCCA sequence
in the putative RNA did indeed serve as a template for TTGGGG repeat
addition. Putting all of these pieces of the puzzle together, I felt there was good
evidence to support the cloned RNA being the RNA component of
telomerase.

In writing the paper on the identification of the telomerase RNA (Greider

elongation. The activity of telomerase adds TTG and the end of the template is reached.
Translocation can then reposition the 3’ end such that base pairing between the terminal
TTG and the telomerase RNA is maintained.

I was so caught up in the data that drawing a model was not foremost in my
mind. However, I found that drawing out how I interpreted the results made
everything even clearer. We knew from our early experiments that there

314


must be a protein component to telomerase in addition to the RNA. I did
not know how many protein components there might be but decided to draw
just one for simplicity. The CAACCCCAA sequence in the RNA represented
one and a half copies of the complementary strand of the TTGGGG repeat
sequence. So the model I drew had the sequence GTTGGG base paired with
the CAACCC, which left CAA free in the template sequence to be copied
(Figure 10). With this in mind, I proposed that telomerase has an elonga-
tion phase during which the CAA is copied, followed by a translocation to
reposition the growing sequence for another round of elongation. I wrote
up the paper and, together with Liz Blackburn, in whose lab I had begun the
sequencing, published a paper in Nature describing the RNA (Greider and
Blackburn, 1989).


Solutions to puzzles show the way to more interesting
questions
Drawing out the telomere elongation model helped to clarify my thinking
about telomerase. Thinking about the model also immediately raised several
new questions that I was curious to address. For example, does the proposed
translocation step actually occur? That is, does telomerase hold on to the sub-
strate it is elongating for a while, or does one enzyme only add one repeat,
with a second repeat added during a second round of binding by a separate
enzyme molecule? This question, which I had not thought of before I drew
the model, was suddenly a burning one for me. I went on to tackle this next
puzzle in a later paper (Greider, 1991). Many other questions arose as we
continued our work on telomerase. The many different paths the research
took and our later focus on telomerase in cancer and human disease is de-
scribed in the Nobel Lecture presentation online at the Nobel Foundation
website (www.nobelprize.org).
   Putting together puzzle pieces is challenging, fun, and extremely gratify-
ing, especially when they lead to new understanding in biology. This process
of making a hypothesis and following leads is not a linear one: there are
many twists and turns in the path. But the key is to keep the excitement and
to follow the leads that are the most rewarding. I learned this during the first
six years of working on telomerase, and it is the approach that I continue to
follow. Many new questions often arise after one part of a puzzle is solved;
the rewarding thing about curiosity‑driven science is being able to pick from
these new questions those that seem the most interesting to me. The plea-
sure of figuring out the puzzle and finding out things not known before is a
great reward. Sharing that experience with friends and colleagues makes the
reward even greater.
