INTRODUCTION

Following the completion of the structural work on the prostaglandins with Sune
Bergstrom and co-workers (for reviews, see refs. l-3) I was very fortunate in
being able to spend a year in the Chemistry Department at Harvard University,
Cambridge, Mass. During this stay I had the opportunity to study both theoreti-
cal and synthetic organic chemistry. The year in Cambridge had a profound
effect on my future research. At this time Konrad Bloch, E.J. Corey, Frank
Westheimer, Robert B. Woodward and several other prominent scientists were
among the faculty members of the department, and it was indeed a stimulating
place for a young M.D. interested in chemistry. I was working in E.J. Corey’s
laboratory, and we have continued to collaborate in several areas since then.
   In 1964 it was established that there was a biogenetic relationship between
the polyunsaturated fatty acids and prostaglandins (4,5). This finding was of
considerable biological interest and since the mechanisms of the reactions in-
volved were unknown, I decided to study this problem in the laboratory I had
established at that time.


MECHANISM OF BIOSYNTHESIS OF PROSTAGLANDINS

The conversion of 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid into prostaglandin E           1 (PGE 1 )

involves the introduction of two hydroxyl groups and one keto group. Incubation
of 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid in an atmosphere of     18
                                                          O2showed that the oxygen
atoms of the hydroxyl groups were derived from oxygen gas whereas the keto
oxygen did not contain any 18O (6,7). That this was due to exchange between the
keto oxygen of the water was shown in later experiments (8). In these studies the
keto group was reduced immediately with borohydride and the resulting
trihydroxy acid derivative was shown to contain three atoms of             18
                                                                              O. These
experiments were extended by carrying out the reaction in a mixture of           18
                                                                                    O2 (8).
The reduced product was converted into the trimethoxy derivative, and the side
chain carrying a hydroxyl group was cleaved off by oxidation with permanganate
                                                                                       117

 periodate. The resulting dicarboxylic acid ester contained the two oxygens that
 were introduced into the five-membered ring during the biosynthesis. Analysis of
this molecule by mass spectrometry showed that it contained either two atoms of
18
   0 or two atoms of 160 in the ring and that molecules with one atom of          18
                                                                                     0 and
one atom of 160 in the ring were virtually absent. The experiment demonstrated
that the oxygen atom of the hydroxyl group at C-11 and of the keto group at C-9
originated in the same molecule of oxygen (Fig. 1).
    It was also shown that the hydrogens at C-8, C-11, and C-12 are retained in
their original positions during the conversion of 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid into
PGE 1 which is in agreement with the mechanism proposed (see below). Experi-
ments with hypothetical intermediates, namely, 15-hydroperoxy-8,11,13-eicosa-
trienoic acid and 15-hydroxy-8,11,13-eicosatrienoic acid indicated that the
initial reaction consisted of the introduction of the oxygens in the ring (9,lO).
However, two different mechanisms for the incorporation of the oxygen molecule
seemed possible (9,10,11). In one of the pathways leading from 8,11,14-eicosa-
trienoic acid to the proposed intermediate, the oxygen is added across carbon
atoms C-9 and C-11 with concomitant formation of the new carbon-carbon bond
between C-8 and C-12. The other pathway involves a lipoxygenase-like reaction
with formation of l l-peroxy-8,12,14-eicosatrienoic acid as the initial step. In


                                                                                        119



both of the pathways leading to the cyclic peroxide intermediate one hydrogen at
C-13 is removed. In the latter pathway the hydrogen at C-13 is most likely re-
moved as the initial step whereas the removal of this hydrogen occurs later in the
first pathway. It was thus conceivable that the removal of the hydrogen was the
rate-determining step and that substitution of tritium for hydrogen in the pre-
cursor would give a kinetic isotope effect. The resulting enrichment should
appear in the precursor acid in the second pathway whereas the first pathway
should produce enrichment of tritium in an oxygenated intermediate. Precursor
acids, which were stereospecifically labeled with tritium at C-13 and labeled
with 14C at C-3, were therefore synthesized (10).
   The conversion of the doubly labeled acids into PGE               1 was catalyzed by a

vesicular gland preparation and the          3
                                              H /14C ratio of the precursor, product and
the precursor remaining after the reaction was determined. It was found that
13D- 3H-3- 14C 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid retained the tritium label during the
conversion to PGE 1. The 13L- 3H-3- 14C-8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid, however,
was transformed into PGE 1 with essentially complete loss of tritium. The pre-
cursor isolated after 75 % conversion was significantly enriched (284 % reten-
tion) with respect to tritium. Thus, the initial step in the transformation of
8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid into prostaglandin is the stereospecific elimination
of the 13L-hydrogen. This reaction is followed by introduction of oxygen at C-11
in a lipoxygenase-like reaction to give 11-peroxy-8,12,13-eicosatrienoic acid
(10,12). It is of interest in this context that soybean lipoxygenase removes the
same hydrogen both specifically (08) and stereospecifically (L) (9). However,
the plant lipoxygenase introduces the oxygen molecule i n ω6 position whereas
the lipoxygenase, which is a component of the prostaglandin synthetase, in-
troduces the oxygen in ω10 position (9). The 11-peroxy-8,12,13-eicosatrienoic
acid visualized to be formed in the initial oxygenation is subsequently trans-
formed into an endoperoxide (8) by a concerted reaction involving addition of
oxygen at C-15, isomerization of the A’        ” double bond, formation of the new
carbon-carbon bond between C-8 and C-12 and attack by the oxygen radical
at C-9. This is shown in Fig. 1. Indirect evidence indicates a free radical mecha-
nism (13,14). The endoperoxide is transformed into PGE           1 by removal of hydro-

gen at C-9 or into PGF I, by a reductive cleavage of the peroxide.
   When washed microsomes were used as enzyme source, eicosatrienoic acid
gave rise to other products (15,16,17). These cannot act as precursors in the bio-
synthesis of prostaglandins; however, their structures and the fate of             3 H in

labeled precursors during their formation provided additional evidence for the
proposed scheme of the transformation. The monohydroxy acid fraction from
an incubation with eicosatrienoic acid was shown to consist of l l-hydroxy-8,12,
14-eicosatrienoic acid, 15-hydroxy-8,11,13-eicosatrienoic acid and 12-hydroxy-
8(trans),lO(trans)-heptadecadienoic acid. The mechanism offormation of the C             17

acid was studied by using 3- 14C-eicosatrienoic acid, which also contained tritium
label at C-9, C-10 or C-11 ( 16). These experiments showed that the conversion
resulted in loss of the tritium label in these three positions. Furthermore, malo-
naldehyde was identified by condensation with L-arginine to give d-N-P-(pyri-
midinyl)-L-ornithine or with urea to form 2-hydroxypyrimidine. The derivative

of malonaldehyde contained the 3H label from the 9- 3H and 11- 3H labeled pre-
cursor whereas 3H originally in position C-10 was lost by enolization of the
malonaldehyde.
   It was further found that a compound with chromatographic properties simi-
lar to those of PGE 1 and which was transformed into                         by borohydride
reduction was formed from eicosatrienoic acid (17). The structure of the new
product was found to be 9α, 15-dihydroxy-11-ketoprost-13-enoic acid ( 1l-de-
                 (18). In the conversion of 9-      3

eicosatrienoic acid to 11-dehydro-PGF        1α , the latter precursor lost the
                                                                                     3
                                                                                       H label,
whereas the 9- 3H label was retained. These experiments on the structures of the
various products from eicosoatrienoic acid and the fate of the             3
                                                                             H labels in their
formation provided strong evidence for the existence of the endoperoxide inter-
mediate.


ISOLATION AND CHARACTERIZATION OF PROSTAGLANDIN
ENDOPEROXIDES

Subsequently it was possible to detect and isolate an endoperoxide from short-
time incubations of arachidonic acid with the microsomal fraction of homo-
genates of sheep vesicular glands (19). The incubation mixtures were treated
with stannous chloride in ethanol in order to reduce endoperoxide into
This was followed by sodium borodeuteride reduction and determination of the
resulting PGF 2, species by multiple-ion analysis. This method made it possible
to assay PGE 2 as well as 11-dehydro-PGFp, and                  It was of particular
interest that a peak of          appeared in the initial phase of the incubation
period. No metabolic transformation of PGF compounds had been observed in
preparations of sheep vesicular gland, and thus it was unlikely that the
 peak could be ascribed to enzymatic formation of                  followed by rapid
 metabolic degradation. Furthermore, when the SnC1 2 and sodium borodeuteride
reduction was omitted, the peak of               disappeared, indicating that
was formed by chemical reduction of an oxygenated derivative present in the
initial phase of the incubation. That an oxygenated intermediate was formed and
temporally accumulated was also suggested by the finding that the rate of
formation was slower than the rate of oxygenation of the precursor acid.
   Additional support for the existence of an oxygenated intermediate that was
convertible into           by SnCl 2 reduction came from experiments in which
reduced glutathione or p-mercuribenzoate was added to the microsomal suspen-
sion. The former agent increased the rate of              formation and suppressed
the peak of           whereas the latter agent decreased the rate of        formation
with a simultaneous increase in the height and duration of the              peak. The
 oxygenated intermediate detected by these experiments was also isolated. On
 thin-layer radiochromatographic analysis of the product (methyl esters) isolated
after a 30-second incubation of             arachidonic acid with microsomes in the
presence of p-mercuribenzoate a new radioactive derivative appeared. This
derivative was identified as the methyl ester of the earlier postulated endo-
peroxide. In an extension of these studies the endoperoxide described above was


                             From Studies of Biochemical Mechanism                            121



obtained as the free acid; in addition, an endoperoxide carrying a hydroperoxy
group at C-15 was isolated (20,21). We suggested the trivial names PGG                      2 for

the less polar endoperoxide (                               11a-peroxidoprosta-5,13-die-
noic acid) and PGH 2 for the more polar endoperoxide                                        1la-
                                    acid). The structure of PGG 2 was established by
three separate experiments. Treatment of PGG 2 with mild reducing agents such
as SnC1 2 and triphenylphospine gave                 as the major product. This showed
the presence of a peroxide bridge between C-9 and C-11 but did not discriminate
between a hydroxy and a hydroperoxy group at C-15 since the agents used would
reduce the latter group into the former. In a second experiment, PGG                       2was

treated with lead tetraacetate in benzene followed by triphenylphosphine. In
this case                      was the major product. Lead tetraacetate causes de-
hydration in hydroperoxides into ketones, and therefore, formation of a 15-keto-
prostaglandin from PGG 2 by this treatment strongly indicated the presence of a
hydroperoxy group at C-15. The isomerization of PGG                2 into 15-hydroperoxy-

PGE 2 in aqueous medium gave independent evidence for a peroxide group at
C-15 (Fig. 1).
    Two reactions are involved in the conversion of PGG              2 into PGE 2, i.e., reduc-

tion of the hydroperoxy group at C-15 into a hydroxy group (peroxidase) and
isomerization of the endoperoxide structure into a ß-hydroxyketone (endo-
peroxide isomerase) (Fig. 1). The endoperoxide isomerase was found to be
almost entirely associated with the microsomal fraction. The enzymic activity
was stimulated by reduced glutathione.
    The endoperoxides were quite unstable (t          ½ = 5 min). However, if they were

 stored under anhydrous conditions in acetone they could be kept for several
weeks. When their biological activity was tested on           in vitro preparations it was
found that the effects of the endoperoxides on gastrointestinal smooth muscle
were comparable to those of PGE 2 and                   On the other hand, the effects on
vascular (rabbit aorta) and airway (guinea pig trachea) smooth muscle were
 considerably greater than those of PGE 2 and                     respectively (22). Both
 endoperoxides were potent contractors of the isolated human umbilical artery
(23). Administration of PGG 2 and PGH 2 intravenously to guinea pigs (22)
produced an increase in insufflation pressure, which was more marked than that
caused by corresponding doses of                     The cardiovascular effects of the
endoperoxides showed a complex pattern. The blood pressure response was
triphasic, i.e., a transient fall consistently followed by a shortlasting rise and then
by a sustained reduction. These studies on vascular and airway smooth muscle
demonstrated that the endoperoxides had effects that could not be attributed
to conversion into the stable prostaglandins.
    Additional studies in our laboratory showed that the two endoperoxides also
 had unique effects on platelets. Thus, PGG             2 and PGH 2 induced rapid and

 irreversible aggregation of human platelets (19,20,24).

DISCOVERY OF AN UNSTABLE AGGREGATING FACTOR AND
THE THROMBOXANE S

The biological effects of the pure endoperoxides were of particular interest in
relation to other studies which demonstrated that arachidonic acid caused
aggregation when added to human platelets (25,26) and that labile aggregating
material (LASS) was formed from this acid when it was incubated with pre-
parations of sheep vesicular glands (27,28,29). Furthermore, the potency of the
endoperoxides in causing contractions of the isolated rabbit aorta was of par-
ticular interest in relation to the so-called rabbit aorta contracting substance
(RCS) (30). RCS was reported to be formed in guinea pig lung during ana-
 phylaxis, and was later suggested to be due to the endoperoxide intermediate
 in prostaglandin biosynthesis (31). We found that material with similar bio-
logical properties was formed after addition of arachidonic acid to human pla-
telets. However, the rabbit aorta contracting substance from guinea pig lung
and platelets was found to consist of one major component with a t            ½ of about

30 seconds and a minor component of PGG                2 and/or PGF 2 with a t ½ of 4–5

minutes (32). The short-lived major component of RCS could be generated by
addition of arachidonic acid to platelets.
   We therefore incubated l- 14C-arachidonic acid with suspensions of washed
human platelets in order to obtain structural information about RCS. Three
major metabolites were isolated (33). One of them was found to be 12L-hydroxy-
5,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (l2-HETE) (Fig. 2) The corresponding hydro-

peroxide (HPETE) could be isolated after incubation of arachidonic acid with
sonicated platelets. Formation of 12-HETE from arachidonic acid was also re-
ported to occur in bovine platelets (34). A more polar metabolite was identified
as 12L-hydroxy-5,8,10-heptadecatrienoic acid (HHT) whereas a third compo-
nent was found to be the hemiacetal derivative of 8(1-hydroxy-3-oxopropyl)-9-
12L-dihydroxy-5,l0-heptadecadienoic acid (thromboxane B          2, PHD). [ 1-
                                                                               14
                                                                                  C]-
PGG2 added to suspensions of human platelets was rapidly converted into HHT
and thromboxane B 2.
   All of the identified metabolites of arachidonic acid were stable compounds
and could therefore not be identical to the very unstable (t           ½ = 30 seconds)

RCS. Additional biological work with the platelets involving characterization
of the material formed from arachidonic acid was therefore carried out. When
arachidonic acid was incubated with washed platelets and an aliquot of the
incubate was transferred to a suspension of platelets preincubated with indo-
methacin, aggregation took place. This was not due to PGG          2 or PGH 2 since the

amounts found were only about one per cent of those required to explain the
response. A more detailed analysis of the appearance of the aggregating factor
and the endoperoxides showed that the amount of endoperoxides was highest in
the very early phase of the incubation period, whereas the aggregating factor had
 a maximum later (35 ) (Fig. 3). Experiments using filtrates of incubates prepared
 as described above showed that the aggregating factor was very unstable. When
the log dose (arbitrary units) was plotted against time of incubation at 37°C,
a linear relationship was obtained. The half-life of the aggregating factor was
33-46 seconds. A factor with similar properties was also generated from the
endoperoxide, PGG 2. In addition to inducing irreversible aggregation, the
unstable factor also caused release of serotonin from platelets.
   Further work involving 18O 2 experiments suggested that thromboxane B                2

was formed from PGG 2 by rearrangement and subsequent incorporation of one
molecule of H 2O (33). It was therefore conceivable that if the rearranged inter-

mediate had an appreciable lifetime it should be trapped in the presence of
nucleophilic reagents (36). This was found to be the case. Addition of 25 volumes
of methanol to washed platelets incubated with arachidonic acid for 30 seconds
gave two derivatives that were less polar than thromboxane B            2 . The mass

spectral data indicated that the two compounds obtained by addition of metha-
nol were epimers of thromboxane B       2
                                          methylated at the hemiacetal hydroxyl
 group (Fig. 4). The two epimers also appeared when methanol was added to
 platelets incubated with PGG 2 for 30 seconds. Addition of ethanol to platelets
incubated with arachidonic acid for 30 seconds similarly gave rise to epimers
of thromboxane B 2 ethylated at the hemiacetal hydroxyl group. Finally, addition
 of 5 volumes of 5M sodium azide to platelets incubated with arachidonic acid
 gave an azido alcohol, i.e. a derivative of thromboxane B          2 in which the hemi-

acetal hydroxyl group was replaced by an azido group. The trapping experi-
ments showed the existence of a very unstable intermediate in the conversion
of PGG 2 into thromboxane B 2.
   In order to determine the half-life of the intermediate, the platelet suspension
was incubated with [ 1- 14C]- arachidonic acid for 45 seconds and the reaction was
stopped by filtration. The clear, essentially platelet-free filtrate was kept at 37°C,
and aliquots were removed after different times and immediately added to 25 ml
of methanol containing tritium-labelled mono-0-methylthromboxane B                      2. A

methyl ester of mono-0-methyl-thromboxane B 2 and the times of incubation
was obtained. The half-life thus obtained was 32+2 (SD) seconds.

   Fig. 4 shows the proposed structure of the unstable intermediate. The acetal
carbon atom binding two oxygens should be susceptible to attack by nucleo-
 philes, e.g. H 20 (giving thromboxane B 2) as well as CH 3OH, C 2H 50H and N 3-
 (giving derivatives of thromboxane B 2 described above). Addition of
 C H30 2H to platelets incubated with arachidonic acid led to formation of
 mono-O-methylthromboxane B 2 lacking carbon bound 2H. This finding ex-
 cluded an alternative structure of the unstable intermediate, i.e. an unsaturated
oxane ((I) in Fig. 4). Furthermore, the t    ½ of thromboxane A    2 seemed to exclude

a carbonium ion structure ((II ) in Fig. 4), which in aqueous medium should be
considerably less stable.
   The available evidence indicated that the aggregating factor and RCS were
due to the same compound. Thus, they were both derived from arachidonic acid
or PGG 2, their formation from arachidonic acid was blocked by indomethacin,
and their half-lives were similar. It was proposed that this material is identical
with the unstable intermediate detected chemically in platelets (Fig. 4) because
of similar properties.
   The new oxane derivatives were named thromboxanes because of their struc-
ture and origin. Thromboxane A 2 is the highly unstable bicyclic compound,
and thromboxane B 2 is the stable derivative provisionally named PHD. The
subscript indicates the number of double bonds, as in the prostaglandin nomen-
clature. The structure of thromboxane B           2 has been confirmed by synthesis

(37,38,39,4O).
   Thromboxane A 2 has been shown to possess a variety of strong biological
effects. The best known of these are induction of platelet aggregation and the
release reaction (36,40) as well as strong constricting effects on vascular smooth
muscle. The first vessel to be studied in this respect was the rabbit aorta (30,32);
later similar contractile responses were observed in other vessels as well, such
as coronary arteries (42,43,44,45,46), the mesenteric and celiac arteries (47,48),
the umbilical artery (23,49), and others.
   These dual effects of TXA 2, induction of vasoconstriction and platelet aggreg-
ation both come into operation after a vessel has been injured. They indicate
that TXA 2 probably plays a role in normal hemostasi s in vivo as well as in patho-
logical conditions with an increased tendency to vasospasm and/or thrombosis.
 Several reviews have been written on the biological effects and possible roles of
 thromboxanes in vivo (e.g. Refs. 41,50). Thromboxane A 2 has also potent con-
tractile effects on airways demonstrable both in vitro and in vivo (51).
   Following the isolation of the endoperoxides and the discovery of thrombox-
ane A 2 it was found that arterial tissue converts the endoperoxide into a product
with opposite effects (52). Structural work demonstrated that it was an enol
ether derivative (53). This vasodilator and antiaggregating compound was
named PGI 2, or prostacyclin. Thromboxane A 2 and prostacyclin probably form
 a hemostatic mechanism for control of the tonus of blood vessels and the aggreg-
 ation of platelets in vivo. These platelet and vessel wall reactions, which are of
 considerable interest in antithrombotic therapy, are summarized in Fig. 5. The
 main focus is now on the development of specific thromboxane synthetase in-
 hibitors for this purpose. For a recent review see ref. 54.

DISCOVERY OF THE LEUKOTRIENE S

The role of prostaglandins in inflammation was brought into focus with the
discovery by Vane and collaborators that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
like aspirin inhibit the enzyme (cycle-oxygenase) responsible for conversion of
arachidonic acid into prostaglandins and thromboxanes (55). Anti-inflam-
 matory steroids also inhibit the formation of prostaglandins; however, the
 mechanism of action is different. The steroids inhibit the formation of prostag-
landins by blocking the release of arachidonic acid from the phospholipids.
Since aspirin-like drugs and steroids have different anti-inflammatory effects
it seemed conceivable to us that some of these differences might be due to for-
mation of additional pro-inflammatory derivatives of arachidonic acid. Studies
of the transformation of arachidonic acid in leukocytes, which were carried out
to test this hypothesis, have recently resulted in the recognition of a novel group
of compounds, the leukotrienes. These compounds seem to be of importance
in both immediate hypersensitivity reactions and inflammation.
    When arachidonic acid was incubated with polymorphonuclear leukocytes it
was found that the major metabolite was a new lipoxygenase product, viz.
5(S)-hydroxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) (56). Additional stu-
dies also demonstrated the formation of 5(R), 12(R)dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-
eicosatetraenoic acid (major product) (leukotriene B 4, c.f. below), two additional
5(S), 12-dihydroxy-6,8, 10-trans, 14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acids, epimeric at C-12,
and two isomeric 5,6-dihydroxy-7,9,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acids (Fig. 6)
(57,58).
   Stereochemical studies, demonstrating formation of two acids with all trans
conjugated trienes and epimeric at C-12 and one major isomer (12R) with
different configuration of the triene raised the question of the mechanism of

formation (58). With isotopic oxygen it was demonstrated that the oxygen of
the alcohol group at C-5 originated in molecular oxygen, whereas the oxygen of
the alcohol group at C-12 was derived from water (Fig. 6) (59). These obser-
vations led us to develop the hypothesis that leukocytes generated an unstable
intermediate which would undergo nucleophilic attack by water, alcohols, and
other nucleophiles. Leukocytes were therefore incubated for 30 seconds with
arachidonic acid followed by addition of 10 volumes of methanol, 10 volumes of
ethanol or 0.2 volumes of N HCl. Trapping with methanol (or ethanol) yielded
two new less polar compounds, which were present in equal amounts and which
had ultraviolet spectra identical to those of compounds I and I I (Fig. 6). Infrared
spectrometry indicated that the conjugated trienes had all-trans geometry.
Mass spectrometric analyses of the two compounds showed that they were
isomeric and carried hydroxyl groups at C-5 and methoxy groups at C-12. The
alcohol groups at C-5 had (S) configuration and it was obvioius that the com-
poundswere the C-l2 epimers of 5(S)-hydroxy,l2-methoxy-6,8,10,14(E.E.E.Z)-
eicosatetraenoic acid (Fig.6).
   These experiments demonstrated that leukocytes generated a metabolite of
arachidonic acid, which can undergo a facile nucleophilic reaction with alcohols.

different conditions always showed inverse relationships between the amount
of compounds I and II and their 12-O-alkyl derivatives. This result suggested
that compounds I and II and the 12-O-alkyl derivatives were formed nonenzy-
matically from the same intermediate.
    The stability of the intermediate was determined by incubating leukocytes
with arachidonic acid for 45 seconds followed by addition of 1 volume of acetone
in order to inactivate the enzyme. After different time intervals aliquots of the
mixture were transferred to flasks containing 15 volumes of methanol. Analysis
by chromatography showed that tht t ½ of the intermediate, measured as the
 12-O-methyl derivative was 3-4 min. Concomitantly with the decrease in the
concentration of the intermediate the concentrations ofcompounds I, II, IV and
V increased whereas the concentrations of compounds III and 5-hydroxy-
6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid remained constant. These data suggested that
the epimeric 5,6- and 1,12-dihydroxy acids (compounds I, II, IV and V) are
 formed by non-enzymatic hydrolysis of a common unstable intermediate, whereas
 compound III is generated by enzymatic hydrolysis of the same intermediate
(Fig. 6). Similar experiments performed at acid and alkaline pH showed that the
intermediate was acid labile and considerably more stable under alkaline condi-
tions. It was also found that the two 5,6-dihydroxy-derivatives (IV and V) were
formed non-enzymatically) from the same intermediate as the enzymatic product,
5S,12R-dihydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acid, and that         18
                                                            0 from molecular oxygen
was exclusively retained at C-5 of these derivatives whereas          18
                                                                         0 from water
was introduced at C-6 or C-12. On basis of the experimental data described
above, the structure 5,6-oxido-7,9,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (leukotriene A         4,

LTA 4) (Fig. 6) was proposed for the intermediate (59).
    The formation of compounds I-V from the epoxide intermediate is shown
in Fig. 6. With the exeption of compound III these are formed by chemical hy-
drolysis of the epoxide through a mechanism involving a carbonium ion. This
derivative added hydroxyl anion preferentially at C-6 and C-12 to yield four
isomeric products which contain the stable conjugated triene structure. The
 formation of compound III is enzymatic since it is not racemic at G-12 and since
 it is only formed by non-denatured cell preparations.
    The structure, 5,6-oxido-7,9,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (leukotriene A 4, c.f.
below) (59) proposed for the intermediate has subsequently been confirmed by
chemical synthesis and the stereochemistry has been elucidated (60). The
5S,12R-dihydroxy acid formed enzymatically was earlier shown to contain one
cis and two trans double bonds in the conjugated triene. The location of th       e cis
double bond (A’-position) was recently established by synthetic methods (61).
The allylic epoxide intermediate can exist in free form since it has been isolated
from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (62). The suggested mechanism
for the biosynthesis of the epoxide from arachidonic acid (Fig. 6) involves initital
formation of 5-hydroperoxy-6,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE). The
epoxide is formed from 5-HPETE and subsequent abstraction of the pro-R
hydrogen at C-10, and elimination of hydroxyl anion from the hydroperoxy
group (63). The dehydration reaction has been found to be catalyzed by a
soluble enzyme, which was recently isolated from leukocytes (64).

SLOW REACTING SUBSTANCE OF ANAPHYLAXIS (SRS-A)

The occurrence of a smooth muscle stimulating factor (SRS) appearing in the
perfusate of guinea pig lung treated with cobra venom was described in 1938
(65). The factor was shown to be released also by immunological challenge (66).
Biological studies of SRS suggested that it might be an important mediator of
anaphylactic and other immediate hypersensitivity reactions (67,68). Charac-
terization of SRS indicated that it was a polar lipid with UV-absorption and
that it might contain sulfur (69,70,71). Studies with labelled arachidonic acid
suggested that this acid might be incorporated into SRS (72,73).
   Studies in our laboratory showed that treatment of human neutrophils with
the ionophore A23187 resulted in stimulation of the synthesis of the 5,12-di-
hydoxy acid (LTB 4) described above (58). On the basis of the stimulatory
effect of the ionophore on both SRS production (74) and LTB            4 formation, the

UV-absorbance data and other considerations we developed the hypothesis
that there was a biogenetic relationship between the unstable allylic epoxide
intermediate in neutrophils and SRS generated in a variety of systems.
   For production of relatively large amounts of SRS we found that murine
mastocytoma cells (CXBGABMCT-1) st imulated with the calcium ionophore
A23187 were more suitable than previously described systems (75). The SRS
was purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. The purified material
showed an absorbance maximum at 280 nm and gave a typical contraction of
guinea pig ileum, which was reversed by FPL-55712 (75). The ultraviolet
 characteristics resembled those of the dihydroxy acids. However, the maximum
was shifted to a 10 nm higher wavelength. This was in agreement with a sulfur
substituent a to a conjugated triene. Labelled arachidonic acid and cysteine were
incorporated into the product.
   Degradation of SRS by Raney nickel desulfurization gave 5-hydroxy-
arachidic acid, indicating that the arachidonic acid derivative and cysteine
were linked by a thioether bond (Fig. 7). This finding also supported the hypo-
thesis that there’ was a biogenetic relationship between the 5-lipoxygenase
pathway in leukocytes and SRS. The positions of the double bonds in SRS were
determined by reductive ozonolysis        . The isolation of 1-hexanol among the
products indicated that the                    bond of arachidonic acid had been
retained. The approach used for locating the conjugated triene was based on
previous studies in our laboratory that had shown that arachidonic acid and
related fatty acids containing two methylene interrupted        cis double bonds at the
ω6 and ω9 positions are oxygenated to give derivatives with isomerization of
the ω6 double bond to ω7. Incubation of the isolated SRS with lipoxygenase
resulted in isomerization of the                    bond into conjugation with the
conjugated triene (forming a tetraene) since there was a bathochromic shift
of 30 nm. This finding indicated that SRS contained a                 double bond and
additional double bonds at        and       The structural work at this stage showed
that SRS was a derivative of 5-hydroxy-7,9,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid with a
cysteine containing substituent in the thioether linkage at C-6. Derivatization
of cysteine was suggested by the failure to isolate alanine after desulfurization.

The cysteine containing substituent was therefore referred to as RSH in the
reports of this work (75,76,77). Further studies involving amino acid analyses
of acid hydrolyzed SRS demonstrated that in addition to cysteine, one mol of
glycine and one mol of glutamic acid were present per mol of SRS. End group
(dansyl method and hydrozinolysis) and sequence analyses (dansyl-Edman
procedure) of the peptide showed that it was
(glutathione). The structure of the SRS from murine mastocytoma cells was
therefore 5-hydroxy-6-S-glutathionyl-7,9,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid, leuko-
triene (LT)C 4 (c.f. below) (Fig. 7) (78). The structure was confirmed by com-
parison with synthetic material. This represented the first structure determi-
nation of an SRS-A (78). The preparation and some properties of corresponding
cysteinylglycine derivativ e (LTD 4 and )    cysteinyl derivative (LTE 4) were als o
reported at the same time (78). These compounds have later been isolated from
natural sources (see below). The proposed stereochemistry for LTC           4 was con-

firmed and unambiguously assigned by total synthesis including preparation
of stereoisomers of LTC 4 (79). The synthetic work was carried out by E.J. Corey
and co-workers. LTC 4 is thus
cis-eicosatetraenoic acid.
   Later studies using a different cell type, the RBL-1 cells, demonstrated that
the major slow reacting substance was LTD            4 (5(S)-hydroxy,6(R)-S-cysteinyl-

glycine-7,9-trans-11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid) (80).
   Following the structure determination of SRS from mastocytoma cells (75,78)
and synthetic preparation of LTC 4, LTD 4 and LTE 4 (78) all of these cysteine
containing leukotrienes (Fig. 8) have been found in a variety of biological
systems using comparison with synthetic material or partial characterization
by chemical or physical methods for identification (Table 1). SRS-A is thus a

mixture of leukotrienes containing cysteine, i.e. the parent compound LTC                4

and the metabolites LTD 4 and LTE 4.
   Transformation of LTA 4 into LTC 4 by enzymatic addition of glutathione has
been demonstrated in both mastocytoma cells and human leukocytes pretreated
with the inhibitor of arachidonic acid metabolism, BW755 (81). These studies
confirm the originally proposed pathway for biosynthesis of SRS, i.e. formation
of LTA 4 from arachidonic acid via 5-HPETE followed by addition ofglutathione
to LTA 4 with opening of the epoxide at the allylic position C-6 to give LTC     4 (75).

   The biological significance of the biosynthetic pathways described and the
cumbersome systematic names of the compounds involved suggested the intro-
duction of a trivial name for these entities (76). The term “leukotriene” was
chosen because the compounds were discovered in leukocytes and the common
structural feature is a conjugated triene. Various members of the group have
been designated alphabetically: leukotrienes A are 5,6-oxido-7,9-trans-l l-cis;
leukotriene B, 5(S),12(R)-dihydroxy-6-cis-8, 10-trans; leukotrienes C, 5(S)-hy-
droxy-6(R)-y-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycyl-7,9-trans-l1-cis; and leukotrienes E,
5(S)-hydroxy-G(R)-S-cysteinyl-7,9-Mm-11-cis-eicosapolyenoic acids. Since pre-
cursor acids containing the          double bond system (i.e. 5,8,11-eicosatrienoic
acid, arachidonic acid and 5,8,11,14,17-eicosapentaenoic acid) can be conver-
ted to leukotrienes containing 3-5 double bonds, a subscript denoting this
number is used (82). Leukotriene A 4 is thus the epoxy derivative of arachidonic
acid which can be further trnsformed to leukotrienes B         4, C 4 and E 4.

   Leukotriene C 4 is metabolized to leukotriene D 4 by enzymatic elimination of
glutamic acid by                  transpeptidase (80). The remaining peptide bond
in leukotriene D 4 is hydrolyzed by a renal dipeptidase to give leukotriene E 4 (83).
It has recently been found that LTE 4 can also function as acceptor of
acid forming a                  cysteinyl derivative, named LTF 4 (84,85) (Fig. 8).
   In addition to the 5-lipoxygenase, leukocyte preparations contain enzymes
catalyzing introduction of oxygen at C-12 and C-15 (86). Recently, evidence has
been obtained for leukotriene formation after initial oxygenation at either of
these positions (87,88,89,90,91).

 BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF THE LEUKOTRIENES

 Studies with pure leukotrienes have provided detailed information about the
 effects of this group of compounds in different biological systems, The leuko-
 trienes containing cystein (LTC 4, D 4 and E 4) are potent bronchoconstrictors in
 several species including humans, and they seem to have specific effects on the
 peripheral airways (92,93,94,95,96,97,98,99). They also show potent vasocon-
 strictor activity and have negative ionotropic effects on the cardiac contractions
 (100).

   In recent studies using bronchi from atopic patients sensitive to birch pollen
 (101) the relative importance of the leukotrienes as mediators of anaphylaxis has
 been demonstrated. Treatment of the preparation with a histamine antagonist,
 mepyramine, and cycle-oxygenase inhibitor, indomethacin, did not reduce the
 response to the specific allergen. However, benoxaprofen and a prostacyclin
 derivative (U-60257), both of which block leukotriene formation (102,103),
inhibited the anaphylactic contraction in bronchi from asthmatics induced by
birch pollen. Incubation of the atopic lung tissue with antigen resulted in a
release of LTC 4, LTD 4 and LTE 4 which could be inhibited by the prostacyclin
derivative U-60257 (101). These studies indicate that the leukotrienes con-
taining cystein (LTC 4, LTD 4 and LTE 4) are major mediators of airway anaphy-
 laxis; the finding that inhibition of leukotriene formation blocks ascaris induced
 asthma in monkeys also indicates that leukotriene antagonists or inhibitors of
their formation could be of therapeutic value in the treatment of bronchial
asthma ( 102).
   When injected intradermally into guinea pigs LTC 4 and LTD 4 cause extra-
vasation of Evan’s blue (92,96,98) . M ore recent studies involving intravital
 microscopy of the cheek pouch of the hamster (Mesocricetus auratus) have
 demonstrated specific effects of these leukotrienes on the permeability of the
post-capillary venules (104). A ccording to dose-response curves, LTC 4 a n d
LTD 4 both induced a significant increase ofvascular permeability at much lower
concentrations than histamine. Leukotriene C          4 was approximately 5000 times

more potent than histamine in this respect. The cysteinyl containing leukotrienes
seem to increase the vascular permeability by a direct action on the vessel wall,
since it occurs rapidly and does not require release ofhistamine or prostaglandins
or the participation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Leukotriene B                4 also

causes extravasation of plasma, although at higher concentrations. The reaction
occurs with some latency and requires adhering leukocytes. Administration of a
vasodilator together with leukotrienes potentiates the increase in plasma leakage
caused by a submaximal dose of leukotrienes, as has been reported in the guinea
pig for PGE 2 and LTD 4 ( 105 ) an d in the guinea pig, rabbit and rat for PGE 2 and
L T B 4 (106,107).
   When LTB 4 was administered to the hamster cheek pouch in the same dose-
range as LTC 4 it caused a dramatic increase in the adhesion of leukocytes to the
endothelium in small venules ( 104). I ncreased adherence of human leukocytes
caused by LTB 4 has also been demonstrated           in vitro using a column of nylon
fibers (108).
   During superfusion with LTB 4 (6-10 min) the number of interstitial white
cells increased. This finding is consistent with the chemotactic stimulant proper-
ty of LTB 4 . This effect of LTB 4 has been demonstrate d in vitro using either the
Boyden chamber technique or migration under agarose (109,110,111,112).
In vivo this effect has been monitored by determining white cell accumulation
in the peritoneal cavity of guinea pigs following intraperitoneal injection of
LTB 4 (113). The studies described above indicate that LTB          4 might be a media-

tor in the migration ofleukocytes from the blood to areas ofinflammation. Recent
work has also demonstrated that LTB 4 activates neutrophils. Addition of nano-

molar concentration s of LTB 4 to the cells results in rapid aggregation, degra-
nulation, superoxide generation and mobilization of membrane associated
calcium (114,115,116).
   Studies on the mechanism of action of anti-inflammatory steroids indicate
that they inhibit the release of the precursor acid, arachidonic acid, whereas
cycle-oxygenase inhibitors as aspirin block the transformation of this acid into
prostaglandins and thromboxanes (Fig. 9). T h e steroid induced inhibition of
arachidonic acid release, proposed to be due to formation of peptide inhibitors
 of phospholipase A 2, prevents formation of not only prostaglandins and throm-
 boxanes but also leukotrienes and other oxygenated derivatives (117,118) . Some
of the therapeutic effects of steroids which are not shared by aspirintype drugs
might therefore be due to inhibition of leukotriene formation. The recent in-
creased knowledge about the transformation of arachidonic acid and the bio-
logical effects of the metabolites seem to provide new possibilities to develop
novel and more specific therapeutic agents.
