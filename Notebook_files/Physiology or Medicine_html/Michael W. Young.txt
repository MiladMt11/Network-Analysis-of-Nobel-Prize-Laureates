                           Summary
• In studies of several unrelated families, presence of Cry1∆11 predicted
  DSPD. The penetrance and frequency of this allele suggests a broad
  contribution to DSPD world-wide.

• Since the mutation is found in multiple members of each family, all
  tissues should be affected.

• Cry1∆11 shows enhanced binding to Clock and Bmal1 in mouse and human
  cultured cells, and Cry1∆11 appears to be a strengthened transcriptional
  inhibitor.

• Competitive binding to Clock/Bmal1 suggests a basis for inheritance as a
  dominant trait.

• Cry1∆11 expression is sufficient to lengthen the period of mouse
  and human fibroblast rhythms.


                      What’s Ahead?

Metabolic and psychiatric disorders are often accompanied by
problems with sleep, but it has not been possible to determine if these
reflect causal relationships.

If large numbers of subjects are available to study, we can rigorously
test whether the impact of a particular sleep mutation extends to other
medical problems.

When the mutation can be studied in multiple, unrelated families, we
can rule out non-genetic (environmental sources) for the disorder.
