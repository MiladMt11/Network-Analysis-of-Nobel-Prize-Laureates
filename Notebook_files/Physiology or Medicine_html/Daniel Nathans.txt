Introduction
Some 3.5 years ago the study of heredity took a chemical turn when Avery
and his colleagues discovered that deoxyribonucleic acid-DNA-is the
“transforming principle” that converts bacteria from one genotype to
another. Watson and Crick’s structural model of DNA then provided the
basis for investigating its role as the hereditary material. There followed
rapid advances in the biochemistry of DNA replication, gene expression,
and regulation of genes. Recently, fresh impetus has been given to the
study of genetic mechanisms, particularly in higher organisms, by several
methodological developments that have opened a new approach to the
analysis of chromosomes: site-specific cleavage of DNA by restriction
endonucleases and electrophoretic fractionation of the resulting frag-
ments; recombination, cloning, and amplification of DNA segments from
any source; rapid methods for determining the nucleotide sequence of
DNA; site-directed in vitro mutagenesis; synthesis of polydeoxynucleotides
of predetermined sequence; and the ability to introduce cloned, function-
ing genes into prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. As a result of these develop-
ments even chromosomes which are largely inaccessible to classical genetic
methods can now be analysed piece by piece in chemical detail. Genes and
signals can be altered at pre-selected sites, and the functional effect of such
alterations determined. And active, synthetic genes can be constructed in
vitro by recombination or by chemical synthesis.
   Many investigators have contributed to the “new genetics”. Contribu-
tions from my own laboratory resulted from our studies of a model
eukaryotic chromosome, that of a small mammalian tumor virus. I became
interested in tumor viruses in the mid 1960’s when I was asked to give a
lecture on this subject to Johns Hopkins medical students. Although I had
been working with an RNA coliphage (a bacterial virus) for some years, I
knew very little about animal viruses. As I reviewed the tumor virus
literature, I was impressed by the fact that simple viruses had a profound
and permanent effect on the growth of cells in culture or in a living
animal. Here was a microcosm of regulatory mechanisms related to the
development of the virus itself and to the growth of animal cells, including
neoplastic cells. At least some of these mechanisms appeared approachable
with the tools of molecular genetics that had been so successfully used with
bacterial viruses. Of course all of this was appreciated by a number of

people in the tumor virus field, but to me it was an exhilarating revelation.
I decided to take a leave of absence in order to explore experimental
approaches to understanding viral tumorigenesis, and gradually to wind
up my work on the RNA bacteriophage.
    At the beginning of 1969 I went to the Weizmann Institute of Science in
Israel, where I worked with Ernest Winocour and Leo Sachs and had a
chance to read and think without interruption. During that spring I
received a letter from a colleague in Baltimore, Hamilton Smith, telling me
about the enzyme he had discovered in the bacterium Hemophilus influenzae
that had the biochemical properties of a restriction endonuclease. This
aroused my interest immediately in the possibility that restriction endonu-
cleases were “trypsins and chymotrypsins for DNA” and prompted me to
review the literature on bacteria1 restriction and modification, beginning
with the initial observations of Luria & Human (1) and Bertani & Weigle
(2). From the incisive work of Arber and his colleagues on the molecular
genetics of DNA restriction and modification (3-5), and the biochemical
characterization of purified restriction enzymes by Meselson & Yuan (6)
and Smith & Wilcox (7), it seemed likely (as first suggested by Arber) that
restriction enzymes could be used to digest DNA molecules into specific
fragments, just as specific proteolytic enzymes are used to fragment pro-
teins. If the genomes of DNA tumor viruses could be dissected in this way,
and if individual fragments of viral DNA could be isolated, one might be
able to determine by chemical mapping which segments of the genome
were responsible for the various biological activities of the virus, an ap-
proach analogous to that Shimura and I had taken earlier to determine the
location of genes along the RNA of a bacterial virus (8).
    I had already decided that the small papovavirus, Simian Virus 40
 (SV40) (9), was the most tractable tumor virus to work with. This virus is a
 non-enveloped, icosahedral particle with a diameter of about 40 nm (Fig. 1).
 Its genome is a ring of duplex DNA with only about 5000 nucleotide pairs
 (10)-equivalent to a few genes-present as a typical eukaryotic
 minichromosome (11, 12). Despite its paucity of genetic information, SV40
 seemed to have all the biological properties of immediate interest: it grew
 in the nucleus of monkey cells in culture (13), and it caused heritable
 changes in the growth of rodent cells, i.e., it “transformed” them to
 tumorigenicity (14). As an initial experiment, I planned to survey the known
 restriction endonucleases for their ability to cleave SV40 DNA. On my
 return to Baltimore in the summer of 1969, DNA in hand, our dissection of
 the SV40 chromosome began.

Cleavage of SV40 DNA by Restriction Endonucleases
For our initial survey of restriction endonucleases Stuart Adler, working
with me in the summer and fall of 1969, prepared restriction enzymes
from Escherichia coli strains B (17), K (6), and K(P1) (18), and he obtained
Hemophilus enzyme from Smith. To our delight, the E. coli B enzyme and
the P 1 enzyme each cleaved the SV40 DNA circle once, yielding full length

linear molecules, and the Hemophilus enzyme cleaved SV40 DNA several
times (19). However, the E. coli K enzyme did not attack SV40 DNA at all.
We tentatively concluded that SV40 DNA has no sequences recognized by
the K enzyme, that the B and Pl enzymes opened the SV40 circle at a
unique site specific for each enzyme, and the Hemophilus endonuclease cut
the viral DNA at several specific sites. Later we were surprised to find that
the Eco B* restriction endonuclease, a complex ATP and S-adenosylmeth-
ionine-dependent enzyme (17) (“Class I”enzyme), does not break SV40
DNA at a specific site, even though the enzyme cuts each molecule once
(20-22). Therefore, Eco B and similar enzymes would not be useful for our
purpose. However, Smith’s Hin d endonuclease, a structurally simpler
enzyme, not dependent on ATP or S-adenosylmethionine (23), was shown
by Kelly and Smith to break DNA at a specific nucleotide sequence (24),
and by Kathleen Danna and me to generate specific, electrophoretically
separable fragments from SV40 DNA (25) (see Fig. 2). Smith’s enzyme
turned out to be a mixture of two different restriction endonucleases (Hin

tic pattern of fragments from SV40 DNA. Subsequently, newly discovered
cleavage site-specific restriction enzymes of the Hemophilus type (“Class II”
enzymes), over one hundred of which are now known (28), were used to
cut SV40 DNA, each yielding its own distinctive digest pattern when the
fragments were visualized by electrophoresis in acrylamide or agarose gels.
Thus, digestion of DNA by Class II restriction enzymes followed by gel
electrophoresis appeared to yield homogeneous fragments derived from
specific regions of the genome.

Cleavage Map of the SV40 Chromosome
To use fragments generated by restriction of SV40 DNA for mapping viral
functions, we needed to locate the precise positions of restriction sites in
the viral DNA, i.e., to construct a “cleavage map” for each restriction
enzyme. This was accomplished by Danna and George H. Sack, who first
determined the size of fragments in a given digest and then their order in
the circular SV40 genome (2.5, 27). The size of each fragment was deter-
mined initially by its relative yield and/or by electron microscopic length
measurements, and later, by electrophoretic mobility relative to standards.
The order of fragments in the viral genome was determined by electro-
phoretic analysis of isolated partial digest products and by sequential
digestion with different restriction enzymes (Table 1). Our initial cleavage
map was based on sites of cleavage by Eco RI (29), Hin dII + III, and H p a
I + II (30) (Figure 3a). The single Eco RI site (22, 31) was designated the
zero coordinate, and map units were expressed as fractional genome
length from that site in an arbitrary direction around the cleavage map.
With this map as a reference, sites of cleavage of SV40 DNA by other
restriction enzymes have been localized in a number of laboratories, yield-
ing the detailed map shown in Figure 3b (32). As seen in the Figure, the
circular SV40 genome can be opened at any one of several different sites
by single-cut enzymes, and small or large fragments can be prepared from
virtually any part of the molecule.

maps made such an analysis feasible. Soon after our isolation of restriction
fragments of SV40 DNA, two groups became interested in carrying out
nucleotide sequence analysis of the fragments - S. M. Weissman’s laborato-
ry in New Haven and W. Fiers’ in Ghent. We were pleased to cooperate in
the initial phase of their important work. At the outset, RNA transcripts of
isolated fragments were used for sequencing. Later, with the development
of rapid DNA sequencing methods by Sanger and Coulson (33) and by
Maxam and Gilbert (34), direct sequencing of DNA fragments completed
the analysis much sooner than originally expected, to the benefit of all
investigators in this field. I am grateful to Sherman Weissman and Walter
Fiers for making their sequence data freely available as the work pro-
gressed. Their nucleotide sequence map (35, 36), consisting of 5226 nu-
cleotides, provides exact positions for each of the restriction sites in the
cleavage map, and allows precise localization of genes and signals in the
SV40 genome, as illustrated below.

Functional Map of SV40
The cleavage map and later the sequence map of the SV40 genome served
as a framework for identifying functional elements of the viral DNA, for
example, the origin and terminus of DNA replication, templates for viral
messenger RNA’s, and the positions of structural genes.
   The origin and terminus of SV40 DNA replication were localized with respect
to restriction sites in the DNA by pulse-labelling experiments (37) analo-
gous to those of Dintzis on the rate and direction of globin biosynthesis
(38), and by electron microscopic analysis of replicating SV40 DNA (39).
The pulse-labelling experiments were carried out by exposing SV40-infect-
ed cells to 3H-thymidine for a time period approximating that required
for one round of viral DNA replication. DNA molecules whose replication
was completed during this time interval were isolated and digested with a
restriction endonuclease, and the amount of radioactivity in each restric-
tion fragment determined. If there is a unique replication origin and
terminus, fragments derived from the segment of the molecule synthe-
sized last will be most highly labeled, and fragments derived from that
segment synthesized first will have the least radioactivity. From the results
(illustrated in Fig. 4) we could infer that SV40 DNA replication does
begin at a unique site, approximately at map coordinate 0.67, proceeds
bidirectionally around the circular genome, and terminates about 180”
from the origin at about map coordinate 0.17. Similar experiments carried
out with SV40 deletion mutants indicate that whereas the origin is at a
 fixed position and therefore must be determined by a structural feature of
 the DNA, the termination point is not fixed, but appears to represent the
junction of the two growing forks opposite the origin (40).
    Viral messenger RNA’s were mapped in collaboration with George Khoury
 and Malcolm Martin (41, 42) and by Sambrook et al (43) by hybridization
 to restriction fragments of SV40 DNA. In summary, viral mRNA present
 in infected cells prior to the onset of viral DNA replication (“early” RNA)

was derived from about half the genome (between map coordinates 0.17
and 0.67) by counterclockwise transcription. “Late” mRNA, i.e., the RNA
that appears after the onset of viral DNA replication, was derived from the
other half of the genome by clockwise transcription (Fig. 5a). Viral mRNA’s
from transformed cells were derived from the early genomic segment plus
adjacent late regions (44). A particularly intriguing finding was the position
of the replication origin between the start of the early and late genome
regions, suggesting a regulatory coupling between replication and tran-
scription (Fig. 5a).
   Recent major refinements in the analysis of mRNA (45,46) have allowed
much more precise mapping of individual SV40 messengers, down to the
nucleotide sequence level in some cases, including the nucleotide positions
of segments spliced out of initial transcripts (46). Some of these more
recent findings are summarized in the map shown in Fig. 5b, taken from a
paper of Weissman and his co-workers (46).
  To locate structural genes of SV40 on the cleavage map, Ching-Juh Lai
and I (48) and Mathei et al (49) determined the mutational sites of tem-
perature-sensitive (ts) mutants of SV40, isolated and characterized by

Tegtmeyer (50, 51) and Chou & Martin (52), by an adaptation of the
 “marker rescue” procedure devised for coliphage           174 (53, 54) (Fig.
6). In this method a single strand circle of mutant DNA is annealed with a
single strand restriction fragment derived from wild type SV40 DNA to
form a partial heteroduplex. Inside infected monkey cells the partial
heteroduplex is repaired to form a duplex circle that has a mismatched
base pair if the fragment overlaps the mutational site. By mismatch correc-
tion or replication a wild type genome is generated, and is scored by its
ability to grow into a plaque under conditions where the mutant virus does
not. By using a series of restriction fragments with each mutant to be
mapped, we could determine which fragment overlapped a given muta-
tional site. Since the position of each fragment in the cleavage map was
known, we could localize any given ts mutation, and hence the genes in
which the mutation resides, in the viral chromosome.
   Lai’s results are summarized in Fig. 5a. All of the tsA mutants (which
are defective in initiation of viral DNA replication and in transformation
(51, 52, 55, 56)) mapped in the early region of the genome between
coordinate 0.20 and 0.43; tsB, C, and BC mutants (which are defective in a
viral structural protein (50, 52, 57)) mapped between coordinates 0.94 and
0.17; and tsD mutants, (which are defective in a second viral structural
protein (58)), mapped between 0.86 and 0.94 map units. Extensive seg-
ments of the genome were mutationally “silent”. From the mapping of
viral mRNA’s and identification of their in vitro translation products (59-
62), and from an analysis of deletion mutants of SV40 (see below), it is now

known that the A gene codes for SV40 tumor or T antigen (also known as
the “A protein”), the B/C gene codes for the major virus structural protein
(VPl), and the D gene codes for the overlapping minor virion proteins (VP
2 and 3). As shown in Fig. 5b, nuclotide sequence data has subsequently
allowed precise localization of each of these genes, including overlapping
in phase “late” sequences coding for the two minor structural proteins and
overlapping in-phase “early” sequences coding for a second early protein,
the so-called small t antigen (35, 36).

In vitro Construction of SV40 Mutants
The mutants just described were isolated by classical genetic techniques,
namely by random mutagenesis and selection of desired phenotypes. As
indicated in Fig. 5a, they covered only about half of the SV40 genome.
With the advent of site-specific restriction endonucleases, it became possi-
ble to take a more active approach to mutational analysis of a DNA
genome by creating mutations in vitro at preselected sites in the molecule.
Site-selection is based on restriction enzyme cleavage of one or both
strands of the DNA, and mutations result from enzymatic or chemical
modification at or near restriction sites. From DNA thus modified, individ-
ual mutants can be isolated without the need for phenotype selection.
Given functional and chemical maps of the genome, interesting regions
can be selected for perturbation to determine the effect of such changes on
the function of genetic elements or gene products. In the case of SV40, to
which these methods have been applied most extensively, a series of
mutants has been generated with deletions or base substitutions at pre-
determined sites in the viral genome. These are proving useful in the
identification and characterization of gene products and of regulatory
signals in the DNA.

Constructed deletion mutants
In general, SV40 deletion mutants are constructed by enzymatic opening
of the circular genome to form slightly shortened linear molecules,
followed by transfection of cells with the linear DNA (63, 64). Fig. 7
illustrates some of the ways to form linear molecules missing a small
segment of the genome. When used to transfect cultured monkey cells,
such linear molecules form covalently closed circles within the cell that are
missing nucleotide sequences at the joint (Fig. 7). The cyclization pro-
cess itself (the enzymatic mechanism of which is not understood) leads to
variable loss of nucleotides from the ends of the transfecting molecule,
thus generating an array of “extended” deletion mutants (63). (To avoid
the formation of extended deletions, linear molecules can be cyclized
enzymatically in vivo prior to infection of cells). If the overall loss of DNA
does not remove a sequence essential for virus reproduction, deletion
mutants can be isolated simply by selecting individual virus plaques arising
in the infected cell monolayer (64). However, if the deletion of DNA leads
to unconditional loss of function, the mutant must be isolated and propa-

gated in the presence of a complementing “helper virus” (65, 66). Once a
mutant is cloned, i.e., isolated in homogeneous form, the position and
extent of the deletion in its DNA can be determined by restriction enzyme
analysis and subsequent nucleotide sequence determination.
   SV40 deletion mutants have been particularly useful in identifying struc-
tural gene products, e.g., the T antigens found in SV40-infected or-trans-
formed cells (67, 68); in locating non-essential parts of the DNA (69); in
more precise localization of the origin of replication (70, 71); and in
defining those regions required for cell transformation (72, 73, 74). Also
important in localizing functions along the SV40 genome are related
experiments on transformation by restriction fragments of SV40 DNA
(75) and on the activity of microinjected fragments (76), and the studies of
adeno-SV40 hybrid viruses containing SV40 DNA segments (77). As a
result of these various investigations it became clear that the early region
of the SV40 genome codes for the T antigens, as noted earlier, and that
this region (plus immediately adjacent sequences) is sufficient for viral
DNA replication and for cell transformation.
   SV40 mutants with base substitutions at p-e-selected sites. Mutants of SV40
with single base pair changes at pre-selected restriction sites have been
constructed by David Shortle, using local chemical mutagenesis, as illus-
trated in Fig. 8 (78). In this procedure, viral DNA is incised in one
strand with a restriction enzyme, the “nick” is converted to a small gap with
an exonuclease, and bases exposed by the gap are then modified by


510                      Physiology or Medicine 1978




reaction with a single-strand specific mutagen, such as sodium bisulfite,
which deaminates cytosine to uracil. When such a bisulfite-treated gap is
repaired either in vitro or inside a cell, a U-A pair is generated in place of
the original C-G pair. Thus, an entire base pair substitution occurs, and
the mutation cannot be reversed by cellular enzymes. If (as illustrated
in Fig. 8) there is only one site in the genome for the restriction enzyme
used to make the initial scission, the mutagenized, repaired DNA can be
exposed to the same enzyme to eliminate those molecules that have es-
caped mutagenesis within the restriction site. When such enzyme-resistant
molecules are used to infect cell monolayers, the majority of resulting virus
clones contain mutants that have lost the enzyme site (78). Recent exten-
sions of the local mutagenesis procedure have broadened the range of site
selection considerably, so that many parts of a DNA molecule can be
targeted for mutagenesis (79).

Constructed Regulatory Mutants of SV40
The local mutagenesis method just described has been used by Shortle and
by Daniel Di Maio to construct mutants with single base pair substitutions
within regulatory sequences of the viral DNA in and around the origin of
replication (81). In one set of experiments SV40 DNA was nicked with
restriction endonuclease Bgl I, which cuts the viral DNA once within a long
symmetric sequence or “palindrome” at about map coordinate 0.67 (35).
corresponding to the map position of the replication origin (Fig. 9). The
Bgl I-nicked DNA was then gapped and locally mutagenized to generate
Bgl I-resistant mutants. Nucleotide sequence analysis of several of these
mutants revealed, in each case, a single base pair substitution within the
palindrome (82) (Fig. 9). What is most interesting about these mutants is
the effect of each base pair change on the rate of viral DNA replication
(Table 2). A G/C to A/T change at position 5 16 1, which forms the axis of
symmetry of the palindrome, has no effect on the rate of DNA replication;

a G/C to A/T change at position 5162 causes a marked decrease in the
DNA replication rate; a C/G to T/A change at position 5 154 leads to a
“cold-sensitive” replication phenotype (i.e., reduced at low temperature);
and a C/G to A/T change at position 5 155 causes an increased rate of DNA
replication. Appropriate tests indicate that the replication-defective mu-
tants have abnormlities in a cis element controlling the rate of viral DNA
replication. The mutational alterations therefore serve operationally to
define the origin sequence.
   Our interpretation of the altered rates of mutant DNA replication is
based on previous evidence of the involvement of the SV40 T antigen in
initiation of viral DNA replication (51) and the preferential binding of this
protein to a segment of SV40 DNA including that shown in Fig. 9 (83).
The postulated first step in the replication of SV40 DNA is the specific
binding of T antigen to the origin signal (Fig. 10). From the properties of
origin mutants it appears that a single base pair change in the signal alters
the binding site, leading to a change in the amount of T antigen bound or
in the activity of the complex. In the cold-sensitive mutants, binding may
be less efficient at 32” that at higher temperatures either because of a

gen. Therefore, these revertants may be producing T antigens that recog-
nize the mutant origin sequence more efficiently than does the wild type T
antigen (Fig. 10). Such double mutants could represent new viral replicons
useful for biochemical investigations of T antigen functions.
   A striking feature of SV40 origin mutants is that many are conditionally
defective. Especially frequent is the cold-sensitive phenotype. This kind of
temperature-dependence of specific DNA-protein interactions is well
known from in vitro studies, e.g., in the case of bacterial RNA polymerase
binding to DNA promotor sequences (84), and may be a general property
of regulatory protein-nucleic acid interactions that could be exploited to
isolate mutants with sequence changes within many different controlling
elements in DNA or RNA.

Analysis of More Complex Chromosomes
The methods used to dissect the tiny genome of SV40 are directly applica-
ble to more complex DNA molecules that can be isolated in homogeneous
form (8.5): large viral chromosomes, plasmids, or DNA from cellular
organelles. Even certain genes in mammalian DNA, whose complexity is
some one million times that of the SV40 genome, have been mapped by
restriction enzyme cleavage, using the sensitive detection method devised
by Southern (86). However, the completely general application of restric-
tion enzymes to the analysis of cellular chromosomes depends on recom-
binant techniques for cloning and amplifying individual DNA fragments
from complex mixtures (87-91), and on the ability to introduce active
genes back into living cells (92-95). These advances have opened the
genome of every organism to the type of chemical and functional analysis I
have described for SV40. Interesting findings have already emerged, for
example the discontinuity of genes in eukaryotes (e.g., 96-98) and the
mobility of gene segments during development (99); and experiments are
underway to identify regulatory elements in cloned cellular DNA. In time
it should be possible to make out the basic regulatory mechanisms used by
plant and animal cells, and eventually to understand some of the complex
genetic programs that govern the growth, development, and specialized
functions of higher organisms, including man.
