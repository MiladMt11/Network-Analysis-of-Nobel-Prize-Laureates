The study of biology is partly an exercise            in natural esthetics. We derive
much of our pleasure as biologists from the continuing realization of how
economical, elegant and intelligent are the accidents of evolution that have
been maintained by selection. A virologist is among the luckiest of biologists
because he can see into his chosen pet down to the details of all of its mole-
cules. The virologist sees how an extreme parasite functions using just the most
fundamental aspects of biological behavior.
   A virus is a form of life with very simple requirements (1). The basic
needs of a virus are a nucleic acid to be transmitted from generation to gen-
eration (the genome) and a messenger RNA to direct the synthesis of viral
proteins. The critical viral proteins that the messenger RNA must encode are
those that coat the genome and those that help replicate the genome. One of
the great surprises of modern virology has been the discovery of the variety of
genetic systems that viruses have evolved to satisfy their needs. Among the
animal viruses, at least 6 totally different solutions to the basic requirements
of a virus have been found (2).
   If we look back to virology books of 15 years ago, we find no appreciation
yet for the variety of viral genetic systems used by RNA viruses (3). Since
then, the various systems have come into focus, the last to be recognized
being that of the retroviruses (“RNA tumor viruses”). As each new genetic
system was discovered, it was often the identification of an RNA or a DNA
polymerase that could be responsible for the synthesis of virus-specific
nuclei acids that gave the most convincing evidence for the existence of the
new system.
   Now that the life-styles of different types of viruses have been delineated
we can ask what relation there is between a virus’ multiplication cycle and
the disease it causes. In general, this question has no simple answer because
disease symptoms do not correlate with the biochemical class of the virus. For
instance, both poliovirus and rhinovirus are picornaviruses but one causes
an intestinal infection with paralysis while the other causes the common
cold. One class of RNA viruses, however, does have a unique symptom asso-
ciated with it: the biochemically-defined group of viruses called the retrovi-
ruses are the only RNA viruses known to cause cancer. For a virologist interest-
ed in cancer, the problem is to first understand the molecular biology of
retroviruses and then to understand how they cause the disease.
   In what follows, I will review my personal involvement in uncovering the
different genetic systems of RNA viruses, a story which leads to the recogni-
tion of the unique style of retroviruses.        I will then consider what is known

about the relationship between the biochemistry of retroviruses and their abil-
ity to be oncogenic.
   As I tell my story I will mention a few of the many co-workers, teachers and
students who have influenced my thinking or contributed their labors and
ideas to the products of my laboratory. To mention all of the people to whom
I am indebted would make too long a list; I can only say that the honors I re-
ceive are in large measure testaments to their accomplishments.

PICORNAVIRUSES
My work on the genetic systems of RNA viruses dates back to my graduate
school days. As part of my introduction to animal virology during a Cold
Spring Harbor course, I heard Richard Franklin describe his then-recent ex-
periments using autoradiography to show that Mengovirus, a picornavirus
and a close relative of poliovirus, could shut off the nuclear synthesis of cellu-
lar RNA early after infection and could later induce new RNA synthesis in
the cytoplasm which appeared to represent synthesis of viral RNA (4). I decid-
ed to go to the Rockefeller University as a graduate student with Richard
Franklin in order to work on the system he had developed.
   Before I began to study how picornavirus RNA was made, it was already
known from the work of Simon that picornavirus RNA synthesis was inde-
pendent of DNA synthesis (5). Furthermore, studies with actinomycin D had
shown that neither synthesis nor expression of cellular DNA was involved in
viral RNA synthesis (6). These results suggested that Mengovirus might
make a cytoplasmic RNA-dependent RNA synthesis system. The concept that
viruses induce synthesis of their own enzymes had strong precedents in bacte-
riophage systems - Seymour Cohen’s work had shown decisively that new vi-
rus-specified enzymes were found in infected bacteria (7).
   We approached the problem of the virus’ effect on intracellular RNA syn-
thesis as a question in enzymology. We first showed that the nuclei from
Mengovirus-infected cells were greatly reduced in their ability to carry out
cell-free DNA-dependent RNA synthesis compared to nuclei of uninfected
cells (8). Later, we showed that cytoplasmic extracts of Mengovirus - or
poliovirus-infected cells contained an RNA synthesis activity not evident in
uninfected cells and not inhibited by actinomycin D (9). When we learned
that the system made RNA of the size and structure of virion RNA (10), it
became clear that it represented the postulated viral RNA-dependent RNA
synthesis system.
   While there has been extensive further analysis of crude cytoplasmic sys-
tems ( 11, 12) and impressive enrichment of the RNA synthesis system has
been achieved (13),. no pure enzyme able to make picornavirus RNA has ever
been isolated so the detailed mechanism of viral RNA synthesis still remains
obscure. Most of our knowledge of how picornavirus RNA is made has come
from studies on the virus-specific RNA molecules in infected cells and their
kinetics of labeling by radioactive precursors. Such research has been carried
out in many laboratories ( 11, 12); my work in this area was done in associa-
tion with James Darnell and Marc Girard. Together we found and studied

the relations between the poliovirus double-stranded RNA, the poliovirus re-
plicative intermediate and the poliovirus           replication complex ( 14). Marc
Girard’s precise in vitro analysis of RNA synthesis capped this whole series
of experiments ( 15).
   A crucial part of the viral genetic system is the manner of translation of
the viral messenger RNA. While working on viral maturation, my first grad-
uate student, Michael Jacobson, and I began to realize that proteolytic clea-
vage was an important part of the process (16). Our work led us to suggest
that the whole 7500-nucleotide viral genome might be translated into a
single continuous polypeptide that we have called a polyprotein (17, 18). Re-
cently, this work culminated in the demonstration that poliovirus RNA can
be translated into this continuous polyprotein in a cell-free system and that
some of the cleavages that make the polyprotein into the functional proteins
appear to occur in extracts of uninfected cells (    19).
   The demonstration that the poliovirus genome RNA is the messenger
RNA for the synthesis of viral proteins,         coupled with the demonstration of
the infectivity of viral RNA (20),        implies that the poliovirus genetic system
is very simple. The existing evidence confirms this simplicity          - as seen dia-
grammatically in Figure 1:        it appears that the incoming “plus” strand          of

RNA synthesizes a “minus” strand which in turn synthesizes a series of plus
strands. This diagrammatic simplicity of poliovirus replication hides a fair
amount of as yet undeciphered complexity as shown by the work of Eckard
Wimmer and his colleagues as well as by work in my laboratory. For instance,
the 3’-ends of the virion RNA and messenger RNA are both poly(A), the 5’-
end of the minus strand is poly (U),       so we assume that they are templates for
each other (21). But these homopolymer stretches have very variable lengths
even in the progeny of a cloned virus; what then determines their length? The
poly (A) serves some obscure but necessary function in the life-cycle of the vi-
rus (22); what is this function? There is no triphosphate 5’-terminus, either
free or capped, on the virion RNA or messenger RNA (23, 24); how then is
the synthesis of these molecules initiated? The 5’-end of the virion RNA and
messenger RNA are different (24); what does this mean?



VESICULAR STOMATITIS VIRU S
Most of the work in my laboratory until 1969 centered on poliovirus. We had
assumed that all RNA viruses would be similar in their basic molecular biol-
ogy but during the 1960’s results emerging from various laboratories implied
that poliovirus, rather than being a model for all RNA viruses, used one out
of a collection of different viral genetic systems. Probably the first dramatic
demonstration of the variety in RNA viruses came from next door to Richard
Franklin’s laboratory at the Rockefeller Institute where Peter Gomatos and
Igor Tamm found that reovirus has double-stranded RNA as its genome (25).
The peculiarity of reovirus was underscored by the demonstration later that
an RNA polymerase in the virion of reovirus is able to a             symmetrically tran-
scribe the double-stranded RNA (26). Th is was the first virion-bound RNA-
dependent RNA polymerase ever found and followed after the finding of the
first nucleic acid polymerase in a virion - the DNA-dependent RNA polymer-
ase found by Rates and McAuslan and Munyon               et al in virions of vaccinia
virus (27).
   Another observation that suggested there were profound differences among
the RNA viruses was the finding that in cells infected by the paramyxovi-
ruses, Newcastle disease virus or Sendai virus, much of the virus-specific RNA
was complementary to the virion RNA (28). This result was in sharp con-
trast to what was found in poliovirus-infected cells where most of the virus-
specific RNA was of the same polarity as virion RNA (11) .
   We branched away from concentration only on poliovirus to include the
study of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) because of the lucky circumstances
that brought Alice Huang to my laboratory. She joined me first at the Salk
Institute and then we both came to M.I.T. in 1968. Alice had studied VSV as
her graduate work with Robert R. Wagner at Johns Hopkins. We decided
that the techniques developed for studying poliovirus should be applied to
VSV, hoping that the peculiar ability of VSV to spawn and then be inhibit-
ed by short, defective particles could be understood at the molecular level. A
graduate student, Martha Stampfer, joined in this work and together we


                               Viruses, Polymerase and Cancer                       219


found that we had bitten off an enormous problem because VSV induced
synthesis of so many species of RNA. In poliovirus-infected cells, only three
species of RNA are seen but we found at least 9 RNA’s in VSV-infected cells
and one of these RNA’s was clearly heterogeneous (29)           - later work showed it
had 4 components (30, 31). In our description of this work we said that 9
RNA species “seems exorbitant”           (29) but we soon realized that each RNA
had its place in the cycle of growth and growth inhibition of VSV.
   As we were beginning to unravel the multiple VSV RNA’s, Schaeffer              et al
 (32) published a paper showing that the major VSV-induced RNA’s in in-
fected cells, like those induced by Sendai and Newcastle disease viruses, were
complementary in base sequence to the virion RNA. We confirmed and ex-
tended that observation,        showing that the virus-specific RNA recovered
from the polyribosomes of infected cells (the viral messenger RNA) was all
complementary to virion RNA (33). This finding presented a pregnant para-
dox: if all viruses were like poliovirus and induced a new polymerase in the
infected cell how could a virus that carried as its genome the strand of RNA
complementary to messenger RNA ever start an infection? There seemed two
possible solutions: the RNA came into the cells and was copied by a cellular
enzyme to make the messenger RNA to initiate the infection cycle or the
RNA came into the cell carrying an RNA polymerase with it.
   Because no convincing evidence for RNA to RNA transcription existed
 (or exists) for any uninfected cell, the possibility of a polymerase with the
incoming RNA seemed attractive. This possibility implied that there might
be polymerase activity demonstrable in disrupted virions of VSV. Almost
as soon as the power of this reasoning was clear to us, we had shown the
existence of the virion RNA polymerase (34). The demonstration of this en-
zyme was the piece of evidence that led to the realization that there is a huge
class of viruses, now called negative strand viruses (35), that all carry the
strand of RNA complementary to the messenger RNA as their genome and
that carry an RNA polymerase able to copy the genome RNA to form multiple
messenger RNA’s,

RETROVIRUSES
The discovery of a virion polymerase in VSV led us to search for such en-
zymes in other viruses. Because Newcastle disease virus made a lot of comple-
mentary RNA after infection it seemed a logical candidate and after an ini-
tial failure (34), we found activity in virions of that virus (36). But a
more exciting possibility occurred to me; maybe by looking for a virion poly-
merase, light could be shed on the puzzle of how RNA tumor viruses multiply.
   In his Nobel lecture, Howard Temin has outlined how he was led to postu-
late a DNA intermediate in the growth of RNA tumor viruses (37). Al-
though his logic was persuasive, and seems in retrospect to have been flawless,
in 1970 there were few advocates and many skeptics. Luckily, I had no ex-
perience in the field and so no axe to grind    - I also had enormous respect for
Howard dating back to my high school days when he had been the guru of the
Summer School I attended at the Jackson Laboratory in Maine. So I decided


220                              Physiology or Medicine 1975


to hedge my bets - I would look for either an RNA or a DNA polymerase in
virions of RNA tumor viruses.
   To make the foray into tumor virology, I needed some virus. Peter Vogt
first sent me some Rous sarcoma virus and, although I later used it to good
advantage, I initially assayed for an RNA polymerase in this viral prepara-
tion and failed to find anything. Then George Todaro helped me utilize the
resources of the Special Virus Cancer Program of the National Cancer Insti-
tute to get some Rauscher mouse leukemia virus. Using that virus prepara-
tion I set out to look for a DNA polymerase activity. With little difficulty, I
was able to demonstrate that virions of Rauscher virus contained a ribonu-
clease-sensitive DNA polymerase activity and, after confirming the results
with Rous sarcoma virus, I knew that the machinery for making a DNA copy
of the RNA genome was wrapped up inside the virions of RNA tumor vi-
ruses (38). Simultaneously with my work, Temin and Mizutani discovered the
DNA synthesis activity in Rous sarcoma virus (39).

BIOCHEMISTRY OF REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE
Once the DNA polymerase activity had been demonstrated in the virions of
what we now call retroviruses, many laboratories began to study the enzyme. A
correspondent of Nature dubbed the enzyme “reverse transcriptase” (40) and
this romantic name has become common parlance. About 2 years after its dis-
covery, Howard Temin and I reviewed the literature on the enzyme (41).
That review and later compendia (42)            make a detailed rehash of the bio-
chemistry of retroviruses superfluous. So,       I will only present a brief sketch
of the picture we have today of how a retrovirus multiplies and how the
reverse transcriptase functions. I will not attempt to credit all of the people
who have helped to clarify this picture.
   There are two separate time-periods that can be distinguished after infec-
tion of a cell by a retrovirus (Fig. 2). The first period, which lasts a few
hours, involves reverse transcription and establishment of the DNA provirus
as an integrated part of the cellular DNA; the second period involves the ex-
pression of the integrated genome and synthesis of progeny virions.
   Analysis of the first period of retrovirus growth has focused on the types
of virus-specific DNA molecules that are produced. One important type of
DNA that has been found is a closed circular duplex DNA of about 5.7 x 10             6



daltons (43). This DNA can transfect cells with one-hit kinetics (44) and
therefore contains the total viral genetic information. Other DNA’s that may
be on the way to becoming the closed circular form are also evident (45). It
has been hard to get definitive evidence as to what DNA form integrates but
presumably it is the circular duplex DNA. Whatever the form that inte-
grates, the evidence is quite good for acquisition of proviral DNA by the chro-
mosomes of infected cells (46, 47).
   The second period in a productive retrovi rus growth cycle starts when the
integrated genome begins making viral RNA (48). Synthesis of viral pro-
teins and progeny virions ensues and the cell ever-after continues to make vi-
ral products except for variations imposed by the cell cycle (49). Among the

Figure 2. The life cycle of an RNA tumor virus.
Based on present knowledge (42), the life cycle of an RNA tumor virus can be separated
into two parts. In the first part the virion attaches to the cell and somehow allows its
RNA along with reverse transcriptase to get into the cell’s cytoplasm. There the reverse
transcriptase causes the synthesis of a DNA copy of the viral RNA. A fraction of the
DNA can be recovered as closed, circular DNA (43) and it is presumably that form.
which integrates into the cellular DNA. Once the proviral DNA is integrated into cellu-
lar DNA it can then be expressed by the normal process of transcription. The two types
of product which have been characterized are new virion RNA and messenger RNA.
Much of the messenger RNA which specifies the sequence of viral protein is of the same
length as the virion RNA but there may also be shorter messenger RNA’s (48). The vi-
rus-specific proteins have 2 known functions: one is the transformation of cells which
occurs when, for instance, a sarcoma virus infects a fibroblast, the second is to provide
the protein for new virion production. The transforming protein is shown here as acting
at the cell surface but that is only a hypothesis.




viral proteins made in the infected cell may be a product that changes the
growth properties of the cell (50);     in such a case the retrovirus becomes a tu-
mor virus.
   The second period of the infection cycle can be dissociated from the first
in a number of experimental systems. For instance, mammalian cells infected
by avian viruses can gain viral DNA but not express it (46). Also, cells can
have viral genomes that they inherited from their ancestors and such ge-
nomes are generally not being transcribed. Nonexpressed genomes can be acti-
vated: bromodeoxyuridine and iododeoxyuridine, for instance, stimulate the
expression of inherited, silent viral genomes (51). The exact mechanism of
activation of the genome for transcription,         initiation of the transcript and
termination of transcription are obscure,      as  are any processing events of the
initial transcript which may occur.

   It is evident that the key piece of machinery provided by the virus for this
unique life cycle is the reverse transcriptase. Purified reverse transcriptase has
the properties of most DNA polymerases:            it is a primer-dependent enzyme
that makes DNA in a 5’           3’ direction using deoxyribonucleoside triphos-
phates as substrates and taking the direction of a template for determining the
base sequence of the product. The enzyme differs from normal cellular DNA
polymerases by having a unique polypeptide structure, having an associated
ribonuclease H activity and being able to make copies of RNA templates as
readily as DNA templates (41) . Genetics has shown us that the avian leuko-
sis viral enzyme, at least, is encoded by viral RNA and needed only in the
first period of the infection cycle (52).
   The primer-dependence of the reverse transcriptase means that the enzyme
can only elongate nucleic acid molecules, it cannot initiate DNA synthesis         de
novo. How then does the enzyme initiate the copying of viral RNA? The an-
swer is that the genome RNA has attached to it a primer RNA molecule
which is, in the case of avian leukosis viruses, cellular tryptophan transfer
RNA (53). The avian leukosis virus reverse transcriptase has a high-affinity
binding site for that transfer RNA which the enzyme presumably uses for
precise initiation of reverse transcription (54).



RETROVIRUSES AND CANCER
The last 15 years of research in animal virology has allowed us to see the di-
versity of genetic systems used by the various types of RNA viruses and has
most recently shown us how distinct the retroviruses are from the others.
Rather than using an entirely RNA-dependent replication and transcription
machinery, the retroviruses have included the DNA provirus in their life-
cycle. Having a DNA intermediate does not make their mode of growth espe-
cially complicated - the DNA formally takes the place of the “minus” strand
in the picomavirus genetic system - but the DNA is probably the clue to why
retroviruses are the only ones able to cause cancer. The DNA provides the nec-
essary stability to the virus-cell interaction so that a viral gene product can per-
manently change the growth properties of an infected cell. Equally signifi-
cant, the DNA stage is probably important to the ease with which retrovi-
ruses carry out genetic recombination (55) ; it is quite possible that the recom-
bination system can bring together host cell genetic information with viral
information and that in this way non-oncogenic retroviruses become oncogen-
ic (56).
   So the inclusion of a proviral stage in the retrovirus life-cycle may provide
critical capabilities towards the development of an oncogenic potential. But
the actual transformation of cells by retroviruses is a highly selective process;
each type of oncogenic virus transforms a very limited range of cell types (57).
If we assume that all transforming genes of viruses are like those of                Rous
sarcoma virus, genes that are not necessary to the growth of the virus (50, 58),
then we can postulate that each type of transforming virus makes a specific
type of transforming protein. Such a protein, by this model, would not be

critically involved in the multiplication cycle of the virus. Isolation of such
transforming proteins and elucidation of their mechanism of action is the
present challenge of cancer virology. Not only will such work help us to
understand carcinogenesis, it may also be important to the study of develop-
mental biology because of the intimate relationship between the differentiated
state of cells and the type of virus able to transform them.
   Another implication of the occurrence of a proviral stage in the life-cycle of
retroviruses is that cells can harbor such viruses as genetically silent DNA mole-
cules. In fact, in most, if not all, animal species, the normal cells of the body
have DNA related to one or more types of retroviruses (59). They receive that
DNA by inheritance, not infection, and in favorable cases it can be as precisely
located in the chromosomes as any gene (60). What is the significance of
these genes that look like viruses?
   There have been three types of explanations for virus-related genes that are
inherited in the germ line of so many animal species:
   1) They are an aspect of the normal genetic complement of the animal and
they are virus-related because they are the progenitors of retroviruses. These
genes play some important role in the life of the animal and so are not dispens-
able. This explanation is basically the protovirus hypothesis put forward by
Howard Temin (37).
   2) They are genes inserted into the chromosome of some ancestral animal
by a retrovirus infection of the germ cells of that animal. Because once the
provirus is integrated it remains stably associated with the chromosome, the
viral genes are inherited by progeny of the original infected animal. There is
one force that can eliminate such genes from a species, the slow but inexorable
process of mutation. As part of this explanation of inherited viral genomes,
therefore, it has been suggested that the viral genes have some positive in-
fluence on the life of the animal and so are maintained by positive selection.
This explanation is closely related to the virogene-oncogene hypothesis (61)
   3) The previous explanation can be modified by the exclusion of any posi-
tive role for viral genes in the life of the infected animal. There are a number
of reasons why positive selection may be an unnecessary attribute to postulate.
For one thing, mutations are rare events and totally inactivating mutations are
much rarer. Also, the virus can be genetically invigorated by becoming a
replicating virus in the body of the animal and then reinfecting the germ line.
When the virus starts multiplying as an independent entity, the burden of
debilitating mutations it might have accumulated could be purged if a sufficient
number of generations intervened between the activation of the latent provirus
and its reintegration into the germ line. The reintegration might even replace
the original provirus (62). If the viral genes were not transcribed in most
cells that have the viral genome, as appears to be the case, the negative effect
of having one or a few integrated genomes would be slight and probably in-
sufficient to cause a serious negative selection against animals with inherited
proviruses.
   I would argue that the third explanation above is the one most likely to be

and cellular activities and does not require the       ad hoc postulation of beneficial
properties of viral products. It treats retroviruses like any other virus, as an
entity with its own life-style and its own accomodation with evolution.
   In summary, I have tried here to develop the view of retroviruses as one of
a number of solutions to the problem of creating a virus. Each virus directs
synthesis of two critical classes of proteins: proteins for replication and
proteins for constructing the virus particle. By encoding the reverse tran-
scriptase, retroviruses have evolved the ability to integrate themselves into the
cell chromosome as a provirus. This is a very sheltered environment in which
to live, only mutation interferes with the continual transmission of the virus
to the progeny of an animal that is infected in its germ cells. In this context,
the ability of some retroviruses to cause cancer is a gratuitous one. But it is
today the most challenging and important attribute of these retroviruses and
the one that will dominate future research efforts in this area.
