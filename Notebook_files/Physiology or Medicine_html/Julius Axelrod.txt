            Noradrenaline: fate and control of its
                       biosynthesis
                          Nobel Lecture, December 12, 1970


When I joined the National Institute of Mental Health in 1955, I began to
think of an appropriate problem on which to work. In reading the literature
I was surprised to learn that very little was known about the metabolism of
noradrenaline and adrenaline. In 1946 Von Euler1 isolated and identified nor -
adrenaline in the sympathetic nervous system and was later to develop sen-
sitive methods for measuring this catecholamine in tissues2. In 1954 I had been
working on the in vivo1 and in vitro1 metabolism of amphetamines and com-
pounds related in structure to catecholamines. Because of this background,
I decided to work on the metabolism of noradrenaline and adrenaline
                                                  5
   Just as this work was begun, Armstrong et al. identified 3-methoxy-4-
-hydroxymandelic acid in the urine of subjects with adrenaline-forming
 tumors. This observation immediately suggested that catecholamines might
 undergo an O-methylation reaction. Cantoni had shown that S-adenosyl-
 methionine formed enzymatically from ATP and methionine can donate its
 methyl group to the nitrogen of nicotinamides and it appeared possible that
 S-adenosylmethionine could donate its methyl group to one of the hydroxy
 groups of catecholamines. In the initial experiment, a rat-liver fraction was
incubated with ATP, methionine and Mg and adrenaline, and the disap-
                                             2+



pearance of the catecholamine was measured7. When these cofactors were ad-
 ded there was a marked disappearance of the catecholamine. When either co-
factor was omitted no metabolism took place. The requirement for both ATP
 and methionine suggested that the liver extract was making S-adenosylme-
 thionine. With S-adenosylmethionine instead of ATP and methionine, even
 greater metabolism of adrenaline occurred (Table 1). The O-methylated me-
tabolite was isolated by solvent extraction and identified as 3-methoxy-4-
hydroxyphenyl-2-methylamino ethanol (metanephrine) . Metanephrine
and normetanephrine were synthesized within two days after isolation by
 Senoh and Witkop at the NIH.
   Rat urine and tissues were then examined by solvent extraction and paper
chromatography for the normal occurrence of normetanephrine, meta-

brain, spleen and adrenal gland . Later, another O-methylated metabolite,
3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol, was identified. The administration of
noradrenaline, adrenaline or dopamine resulted in an elevated excretion of
O-methylated amines, acid and alcohol metabolites. As a result of these ex-
periments the scheme shown in Fig. 1 was proposed for the metabolism of
noradrenaline and adrenaline. Dopamine undergoes an analogous pathway.




The enzyme that O-methylates catecholamines was partially purified from
rat liver and its properties studieda. It requires Mg 2+ (Table 1), but other diva-
lent ions such as Mn2+, Co2+, Zn2+, Cd2+ and Ni2+ could be substituted. S-
Adenosylmethionine is necessary as the methyl donor. All catechols exam-
ined were O-methylated by the enzyme, including adrenaline, noradrenaline,
dopamine, dopa (Table 1), 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid, 3,4-dihydroxy -

   COMT is present in all mammalian species examined9 and exists also in
some plants17. Of all animal tissues, the liver and kidney exhibit highest ac-
tivity. Unequally distributed in different regions of the brain, the enzyme’s
highest activity is present in the area postrema, and lowest activity is in the
cerebellar cortex18. Catechol-O-methyltransferase occurs mainly in the sol-
                                                                              19
uble fraction of the cell, but small amounts are present in fat cell membranes
and in microsome20. COMT acts on catecholamines mainly outside the
neurone, whereas monoamine oxidase, the other major enzyme for catechol-
amine metabolism, is localized mainly within the neurone. However, small
amounts of COMT are present in the sympathetic nerves of the nictitating
membrane and the vas deferens22. COMT is involved mainly in the metabo-
lism of catecholamines released into the circulation23 and in the inactivation
of noradrenaline in tissues with sparse adrenergic innervation24. It also ap-
pears to be associated with an extraneural uptake mechanismas. Recently we
have observed that COMT is present within mammalian erythrocytes. This
provided an easily available tissue to examine this enzyme in man. The activ-
ity of COMT in erytkocytes is reduced in women with primary affective
disorders 27.
   The discovery of COMT led to the description of other methyltransferases
involved in biogenic amine metabolism: histamine-N-methyltransferase28,
hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase 29, phenylethanolamine-N-methyl-
transferase 30, and a nonspecific methyltransferase31.



              Uptake of noradrenaline by sympathetic nerves

Soon after the work on O-methylation was begun, the distribution of [3H]-
adrenaline in animal tissues was investigated. Fortunately, Seymour Kety ar-
ranged for the synthesis of tritiated noradrenaline and adrenaline of high spe-
cific activity labeled on a 7-position. This made possible the administration of
physiological amounts of the neurotransmitter and a study of the localization
and metabolism of the circulating catecholamine. In collaboration with
Weil-Malherbe and Whitby, specific methods for the measurement of
adrenaline, noradrenaline and its O-methylated metabolites in tissues were
developed. After the intravenous injection of [3H]adrenaline 32 or [3H]nor-
adrenaline 33 in cats, these catecholamines were rapidly and unequally distrib-
uted in tissues. The amines were selectively taken up in tissues heavily inner-
vated with sympathetic nerves (heart, spleen). Since negligible amounts of


448                        1970 JULIUS AXELROD

[3H]catecholamines were present in the brain, a blood-brain barrier to these
compounds was indicated. O-methylated metabolites, [3H]metanephrine
and [3H]normetanephrine, also occurred in tissues. When tissues were ex-
amined two hours following the administration of the catecholamines, long
after the physiological effects had disappeared, they were found to have al-
most the same levels of [3H]adrenaline and [3H]noradrenaline as those found
after two minutes. These experiments suggested that noradrenaline and
adrenaline were taken up and retained in tissues in a physiologically inactive
form. The selective binding of the catecholamines by tissues with a high
adrenergic innervation pointed to the sympathetic nerves as the sites of reten-
tion. To examine this possibility the superior cervical ganglia of cats were re-
moved unilaterally and sufficient time (7 days) was allowed to elapse for com-
plete degeneration of the sympathetic nerves fibers. [ 3H]Noradrenaline was
then given intravenously and the animals were killed one hour later and the
[3H]catecholamine content was examined in structures innervated by the
sympathetic cervical ganglia 34. There was a sharp reduction in the uptake of
[3H]noradrenaline in the chronically denervated structures (Table 2). These
results made it apparent that sympathetic nerve endings take up and retain the
circulating catecholamine.

  Right superior cervical ganglia were removed from 6 cats. After 7 days cats were given
  25      [3H]noradrenaline and the [3H]catecholamine assayed in innervated and dener-
  vated structures one hour later. In the acute denervation experiments right superior
  ganglia were removed 15 minutes before the administration of [3H]noradrenaline. Re-
                sults are expressed as    [3H]noradrenaline per g tissue34.

 To localize the intranenronal site of the noradrenaline retention, combined
 electron microscopy and autoradiography were carried out. [3H]Noradren-
 aline was injected; 30 minutes later the pineal was prepared for autoradiog-
 raphy and electron microscopy 3 5. The pineal gland was chosen because of

its rich sympathetic innervation. Electron microscopy showed a striking lo-
calization of photographic grains overlying non-myelinated axons which con-
 tained granulated vesicles of about 500 Å.
   With Potter attempts were made to isolate the dense core vesicles associ-
ated with the [3H] noradrenaline . Previously Von Euler and Hillarp had
                                    36,37



isolated a high-speed noradrenaline-containing granular fraction from bo-
vine splenic nerves38. Again, [3H] noradrenaline was injected in rats and sub-
cellular fractions of the heart and other tissues were separated in a continuous
sucrose gradient36. The predominant peak of the [ 3H]noradrenaline together
with the endogenous catecholamine coincided with the "microsomal band"
(Fig. 2). The noradrenaline containing particles had no pressor action unless
they were lysed in dilute acid, suggesting that the catecholamine was bound.
In addition to [3H] noradrenaline, the microsomal peak also contained large
amounts of                  - oxidase , the enzyme that converts dopamine to
                                      37



noradrenaline. Further attempts to purify noradrenaline containing vesicles
were unsuccessful.
    The ability to take up and store [3H] noradrenaline enabled Hertting and me
to label the neurotransmitter in the nerve endings of tissues and to study its
fate on liberation from sympathetic nerves39. Cats were given [3H]noradren-

were rapidly removed and homogenized in isotonic sucrose. A portion was layered on
an exponential sucrose gradient and centrifuged in a Spinco preparative centrifuge using
an SW39 rotor for 30 minutes36. Drops were collected with a needle through the bottom
             of the tube and assayed for 3H and endogenous noradrenaline.

aline; the spleen, containing nerve endings labelled with [3H]noradrenaline,
was perfused; the splenic nerve was stimulated, as described by Brown and
Gillespie 40; and the radioactive catecholamine and its metabolites were mea-
sured in the venous outflow. After each series of stimulations a marked in-
crease occurred in the concentration of [3H]noradrenaline in the venous out-
flow. There was also a small but measurable elevation of the O-methylated
metabolite, normetanephrine, but no increase in deaminated metabolites.
From these experiments we concluded that noradrenaline liberated from the
nerve terminals was inactivated by several mechanisms. Part is discharged
into the bloodstream; part is O-methylated by COMT, and part is taken up
by the nerve terminals. Reuptake of noradrenaline by sympathetic neurones
was examined in experiments performed with Rosell and Kopin41 using the
vascular bed of the dog gracilis muscle in situ. The sympathetic nerves of the
gracilis muscle were labeled by an infusion of [3H]noradrenaline, and the
discharge of [3H] noradrenaline measured after nerve stimulation. When the
vasomotor nerves were stimulated, an initial reduction in the outflow of
[3H]noradrenaline was followed by a rise in outflow of the radioactive cate-
cholamine (Fig. 3). The lag in the outflow was due to an increase in vascular
resistance. This observation indicates a reduced capacity of the vascular bed to
carry away the released noradrenaline. After the stimulus was ended, decline
in [3H]noradrenaline outflow and return of the peripheral resistance were
parallel. To block the constriction of the vascular bed, dogs were pretreated

 ing sympathetic nerve stimulation, before and after treatment with phenoxybenzamine.

with phenoxybenzamine, an adrenergic blocking agent shown to inhibit
reuptake of noradrenaline. Vasomotor stimulation resulted in an immediate
and larger increase in noradrenaline outflow. The larger and immediate out-
flow of noradrenaline was due to a blockade of noradrenaline reuptake by
phenoxybenzamine. It was concluded from this and other experiments that
reuptake by sympathetic nerves was a major mechanism for terminating the
actions of the neurotransmitter noradrenaline. Subsequent work by several
investigators, particularly Iversen
                                     4 2 , 4 3
                                               described the properties of the neuro-
nal uptake mechanism. It obeys saturation kinetics of the Michaelis-Menten
type: it is stereospecific for the Z-isomer of noradrenaline and requires Na + .
Many other amines structurally related to noradrenaline can be taken up and
stored in sympathetic nerves by a neuronal uptake process. The fate of nor-
adrenaline at the sympathetic nerve terminal and circulation is shown in Fig. 4.

COMT is catechol-O-methyltransferase; MAO is monoamine oxidase.

Noradrenaline can also be taken up by an extraneuronal process 44,45 which
has been shown46 to be similar to Iversen’s Uptake 2. This uptake is inhibited
by adrenergic blocking agents and normetanephrine25. Compounds such as
isoproterenol which have a low affinity for intraneural uptake and a high
affinity for extraneural uptake may be inactivated by the later process. Ex-
traneural uptake operates at all concentrations of catecholamines47 and serves

to transport amines into non-neuronal tissues in which they are subsequently
metabolized.



                            Effect of drugs on neuronal uptake

The ability of the sympathetic nerves to take up [3H]catecholamines provided
a relatively simple technique for studying the effect of a variety of drugs acting
on the sympathetic nervous system. In early experiments of this kind, mice
were treated with a variety of drugs and the rate of disappearance of [3H]-
adrenaline was measured48. A wide variety of drugs (imipramine, chlorprom-
azine, cocaine, reserpine, amphetamine, tyramine) increased the rate of dis-
appearance of the catecholamine. Such experiments suggested that these drugs
might increase the rate of metabolism by interfering with the binding and/or
uptake of the catecholamines, thus exposing them to enzymatic attack by
COMT or monoamine oxidase. This suggestion was supported by the ob-
servation that the catechol quercitrin markedly slowed catecholamine metab-
olism in vivo, presumably by inhibiting COMT.
    The experiments that followed were more direct. Cats were treated with
 cocaine, and then [3Hnoradrenaline was injected intravenously. One hour
 later, heart, spleen and adrenal gland were examined for [3H]noradrenaline 49.
 Cats pretreated with cocaine showed a dramatic decrease in tissue [3H]nor-
 adrenaline. In addition, there was a sharp elevation in plasma levels of [ 3H] -
noradrenaline in cocaine-treated animals. This experiment revealed that co-
caine markedly reduces the uptake of noradrenaline in tissues, presumably the
 sympathetic neurone. The inhibition of uptake by cocaine thus raised the ex-
traneural concentration of noradrenaline (as reflected by the elevated level in
 plasma catecholamine). By blocking uptake into the nerves, cocaine caused
an elevated concentration of noradrenaline to reach the receptor (Fig. 5), and
 this explains the effect of the drug and denervation of sympathetic nerves in
 producing supersensitivity.
     Experiments similar to those described with cocaine were carried out with
  other drugs50,51 . The following compounds lowered the concentration of
  [3H]noradrenaline in tissues: imipramine, chlorpromazine, tyramine, am-
  phetamine, guanethedine, reserpine and phenoxybenzamine. All of these drugs
 also elevated the initial blood level of the [3H]catecholamine. Such observa-
  tions indicate that these drugs also interfere with the uptake of noradrenaline
  into the adrenergic neurone.

   In addition to blocking uptake, these drugs could also prevent the storage
   or release of the bound [3H] noradrenaline. If a drug prevents noradrenaline
   uptake, it should lower the tissue levels of [3H] noradrenaline only when given
   before the [3H]catecholamine. If it reduces the concentration when given after
   [3H]noradrenaline, when the neurotransmitter is bound to tissue, then it re-
   leases the catecholamine. To distinguish between these two possibilities rats
   were given drugs before or after the intravenous injection of [ 3H]noradren-
   aline, and the amount of the [3H] catecho lamine in the heart was measured52.
   Reserpine, amphetamine and tyramine reduced the [ 3H]catecholamine after
   it was bound. Pretreatment with imipramine (Fig. 6) or chlorpromazine low-
   ered the concentration of cardiac [3H]noradrenaline only when given before
   [3H]noradrenaline, indicating that these drugs blocked uptake but did not

release the amine. Amphetamine caused a greater reduction when given be-
fore [3H]noradrenaline than after (Fig. 6), indicating that it not only blocks
uptake but also releases the catecholamine. Many of these observations were
confirmed and extended through direct visualization of the sympathetic
neurone by histofluorescent techniques53.
   [3H]Noradrenaline was also used to measure the effect of drugs in blocking
the spontaneous release of the neurotransmitter. Long-lasting ganglionic
blocking agents (chlorisondamine; Fig. 6) and bretylium inhibited the spon-
taneous release of [3H] noradrenaline from the rat heart54,55. Decentralization
of the superior cervical ganglion also slowed spontaneous release of [ 3H]nor-
adrenaline, again demonstrating that nerve impulses cause a release of the
[3H]noradrenaline 54.


        Uptake, storage, release and metabolism of [3H]noradrenaline
                                in the rat brain

In 1954 Vogt demonstrated the presence of noradrenaline in the brain and
showed that it was unequally distributed 5 6. Drugs such as amphetamine and
reserpine 56-58 lowered the tissue concentration of endogenous noradrenaline,
whereas monoaminoxidase inhibitors elevated the level of the catechol-
amine 58. In our earlier work we were unable to study the disposition of nor-
adrenaline in the brain because of its inability to cross the blood-brain bar-
rier 33. In 1964 Jacques Glowinski devised a technique for introducing [3H] -
noradrenaline into the rat brain via the lateral ventricle59. This provided a
means of labeling the brain stores of noradrenaline and enabled us to study the
fate of this compound in the brain and examine the effect of drugs. The initial
concern was whether this exogenously administered [3H]noradrenaline mixed
with the endogenous pool of brain catecholamines. We first examined the
distribution of the [3H]noradrenaline in various brain areas. After an intra-
ventricular injection, [3H]noradrenaline was selectively distributed in areas
which contained high concentrations of catecholamines, the highest levels
occurred in the hypothalamus and the lowest in the cerebral cortex and cere -
bellum60. However, considerable amounts of [3H]noradrenaline were present
in the corpus striatum, which normally contains high levels of dopamine and
little endogenous noradrenaline. In autographic studies intense labeling was
also found in the periventricular and ventromedial nuclei of the hypothalamus,
medial forebrain bundle, in specific tracts of the spinal cord and in the apical


                            NORADRENALINE,              BIOSYNTHESIS                        455
        dendritic layer of the hypocampus. Subcellular distribution studies, using con-
        tinuous sucrose gradients, showed the [3H] noradrenaline, after its intraven-
        tricular administration in the brain, was present in the synaptosomal layer
        (pinched off nerve endings) together with endogenous noradrenaline. These
        observations indicated that [3H]noradrenaline mixed to a considerable degree
        with the endogenous brain stores of the catecholamine. The [3H]noradrenaline
        persisted in the brain for long periods of time, indicating that it was stored
        and protected from metabolism. The radioactive metabolites formed were
        normetanephrine and O-methylated deaminated metabolites. The major
        product in the brain was [3H]3 -methoxy-4-hydroxyphenylglycol.
            Labeling of the brain stores of noradrenaline provided an opportunity to
         study the effects of drugs on the uptake, storage, release and metabolism of
         noradrenaline in the brain62. It was previously shown that imipramine and
         chlorpromazine blocked the uptake of [3H] noradrenaline in intact peripheral

methylimipramine and amitriptyline reduced the accumulation of [3H]nor-
adrenaline in the brain, but structurally related derivatives of imipramine
which are clinically inactive as antidepressants had no effect. Both monoamine
oxidase inhibitors and imipramine are antidepressant drugs and cause an in-
creased amount of physiologically active noradrenaline to react with the adren-
ergic receptors in the brain. Each of these compounds makes more nor-
adrenaline available in the brain by different mechanisms. Imipramine and
other tricyclic antidepressant drugs slow inactivation by reuptake into the
neurone, and monoamine oxidase inhibitors prevent metabolism of the cate-
cholamine. Amphetamine has multiple actions on the disposition of the cate-
cholamine in the brain62. Like tricyclic antidepressants, it blocks uptake into
the neurone, causes release of the catecholamine from its storage site, and in- .
hibits monoamine oxidase. Amphetamine administration results in an in-
creased formation of [3H] normetanephrine in brain, whereas reserpine causes
an increase in deaminated metabolites. These metabolic changes reflect a re-
lease from the neurone of physiologically active noradrenaline by amphet-
amine and a release of inactive metabolites by reserpine.
   Glowinski and Iversen performed a study on metabolism of noradrenaline
in different brain regions. They found that all areas of the brain except the
skiatum can convert dopamine to noradrenaline64. Amphetamine blocked
the reuptake of noradrenaline in all brain areas, whereas desmethylimipramine
inhibited uptake in cerebellum, medulla oblongata and hypothalamus, but
not in the corpus striatum . Rates of turnover of brain noradrenaline were
                             6 2



also examined by such different experimental approaches as measuring rates
of disappearance of endogenous noradrenaline after inhibiting catecholamine
biosynthesis, estimating rates of disappearance of [3H]noradrenaline formed
from [3H]dopamine, and determining rates-of disappearance of [3H]nor-
adrenaline after its intraventricular injection. These methods produced results
in close agreement with one another. Cerebellum had the fastest turnover and
the medulla oblongata and hypothalamus had the slowest turnover65. With
these techniques subsequent work has established that turnover of brain nor-
adrenaline is altered by a variety of stresses, temperature changes and sleep.

 nal. The final step is catalyzed by phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase
 (PNMT) and occurs almost exclusively in the adrenal medulla”. In the adrenal
 gland the biosynthetic enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase,                  -oxidase
 and phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase are confined almost entirely
 to the adrenal medulla.
    Noradrenaline in sympathetic nerves and catecholamines (noradrenaline
and adrenaline) in the adrenal medulla are in constant flux. They are continu-
ously being released, metabolized, and synthesized, yet they maintain a re-
markably constant level in tissues. Recent work in our laboratory and those
of others revealed several mechanisms that regulate the biosynthesis of cate-
                               -
cholamines, involving long -term    hormonal controls as well as short- and
long- term neural regulation.

In species such as dogfish, where the chromaffin tissue is located outside the
adrenal gland, little or no adrenaline occurs 7 0. In species where the medulla is
completely contiguous with the cortex (human and rat) almost all of the
catecholamine content is adrenaline. This suggested to Wurtman and me71
that the adrenal cortex might affect the activity of the adrenaline forming

enzyme phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase. I had been working on
the properties of this enzyme and developed a sensitive and specific assay for
its measurement30. In the initial experiment we measured the effect of hypo-
physectomy on the phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase in the adrenal
gland 71. The hypophysectomized rats showed steady fall of the adrenaline-
forming enzyme until about 20 percent of the initial concentration remained
(Fig. 8). The da i l y administration of either ACTH (Fig. 8) or dexamethasone
for 21 days restored enzyme activity to normal levels in hypophysectomized

rats. To examine whether the corticoid-induced rise in PNMT was due to
increased synthesis of new enzyme protein, dexamethasone was given to rats
whose RNA-dependent protein synthesis had been inhibited by puromycin
or actinomycin D. Both inhibitors of protein synthesis prevented the rise of
enzyme activity caused by dexamethasone. However, repeated administra-
tion of ACTH or dexamethasone to intact rats failed to elevate adrenal
PNMT activity above normal levels.

    In view of the effect of hypophysectomy on the adrenal PNMT activity,
the effect on other catecholamine biosynthetic enzymes was examined. After
hypophysectomy there was a fall of adrenal-gland tyrosine hydroxylase72.
(Fig. 8). Enzyme activity was reduced 25 percent in 5 days (Fig. 8) and to
about half in 10 days. Repeated administration of ACTH restored tyrosine
hydroxylase activity to normal values in hypophysectomized rats (Fig. 8). In
contrast to PNMT, dexamethasone did not elevate tyrosine hydroxylase ac-
tivity in hypophysectomized rats. Again repeated doses of large amounts of
ACTH did not increase adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase in normal rats.
                            (the enzyme that converts dopamine to noradren-
 aline) activity was also examined in hypophysectomized rats73. This enzyme
 decreases to about 30 percent of normal values after 21 days (Fig. 3). Adminis-
 tration of ACTH for 5 days caused                  -oxidase activity to increase,
 but full activity was not reached in this period of time. These observations in-
 dicate that the normal maintenance of the catecholamine biosynthetic en-
 zymes in the adrenal glands requires ACTH.



                       Neural regulation

The biosynthesis of catecholamines in the sympathetic nerves and the adrenal
gland is under precise control by nervous mechanisms, one of which is rapid
and the other slower. After prolonged stimulation of the splanchnic nerve the
sum of the amount of catecholamines released together with the amount re-
maining in the gland is greater than that initially present in the gland 74. This
indicated that nerve impulses increases the biosynthesis of catecholamines.
Weiner and his coworkers using an isolated preparation of the hypogastric
nerve of the vas deferens showed that stimulation resulted in an increased syn-
thesis of [14C]noradrenaline from [14C]tyrosine, but not from [14C]dopa 75.
They also found that addition of noradrenaline prevented an increase in [14C] -
catecholamine formation from [14C]tyrosine. However, stimulation of the
vas deferens did not change the total amount of noradrenaline or tyrosine
hydroxylase in vitro. The fact that noradrenaline is capable of inhibiting the
conversion of [14C]ty rosine to noradrenaline indicated a rapid feedback in-
hibition at the tyrosine hydroxylase step.
  Another type of regulation of catecholamine biosynthesis was uncovered in
an unexpected manner. Tranzer and Thoenen76 reported that 6-hydroxydop-
amine selectively destroyed sympathetic nerve terminals. Thoenen decided


460                       1970 JULIUS AXELROD

to spend a sabbatical year in my laboratory, and together with Mueller we
examined the effect of chemical destruction of sympathetic nerve terminals
by 6-hydroxydopamine on the biosynthetic enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase.
As expected, the enzymes completely disappeared within two days after the
administration of 6- hydroxydopamine7 7. However, when the adrenal gland
was examined a marked increase in tyrosine hydroxylase was observed. Since
6- hydroxydopamine lowers blood pressure, the increase in enzyme activity
caused by this compound might be due to a reflex increase in sympathetic
adrenal activity. Consequently we examined the effect of reserpine, which is
known to reduce blood pressure and increase preganglionic neuronal activity.
Reserpine produced a marked increase in tyrosine hydroxylase activity over
several days in theadrenal gland of the rat and several other species, in the supe-
rior cervical ganglion (Fig. 9) and in the brainstem of the rabbit78,79. The
adrenergic blocking agent phenoxybenzamine also caused a reflex increase in
sympathetic adrenal activity. And again the administration of this compound
resulted in an elevation in tyrosine hydroxylase activity in the adrenal gland.
To examine whether the increased enzyme activity is due to the formation of
new enzyme molecules, protein synthesis was inhibited prior to the adminis-

crease in enzyme activity might be a blood-borne factor, as in the induction
of PNMT by ACTH, or an increase in the activity of the preganglionic neu-
rones. To examine the latter possibility, we cut unilaterally the splanchnic
nerve supplying the adrenal gland81 and preganglionic fibers to the superior
cervical ganglion and then administered reserpine78. This drug caused the ex-
pected rise in tyrosine hydroxylase in the innervated side but the increase in
tyrosine hydroxylase on the denervated side was completely prevented (Fig.
9). These results indicate that the increase in tyrosine hydroxylase is due to a
transsynaptic induction of the enzyme. Studies on the molecular mechanisms
that cause this induction across nerves have thus far proved unsuccessful. The
neuronaliy-mediated induction of tyrosine hydroxylase after reserpine is also
observed in the nerve terminals as well as the cell body. However, the increase
in tyrosine hydroxylase in the nerve terminals lags behind the ganglia by two
or three days82. Experiments with inhibitors of protein synthesis point to a
local formation of induced tyrosine hydroxylase in the nerve terminals rather
than the peripheral movement of the completed enzyme.
    Similar studies on the induction of               -oxidase, an enzyme pres-
ent in the noradrenaline storage granule, were undertaken with the collabo-
ration of Molinoff, Weinshilboum and Brimijoin83. These experiments were
made possible because a very sensitive assay for                             was
 developed. This enzyme could be measured where it never has been found
before. Repeated administration of reserpine caused a marked rise in dop-
                     in rat stellate and superior cervical ganglia (Fig. 9) in the
nerve terminals as well as in the adrenal medulla. The elevation of dopamine-
   -oxidase in sympathetic ganglia was blocked by protein synthesis inhibitors
 or by surgical decentralization (Fig. 9). Recently we have found that dop-
                     is present in the plasma of man and other mammalian spe-
 cies84. Preliminary experiments indicate that the circulating                   -
 oxidase comes from sympathetic nerve terminals. The activity of PNMT in
 the adrenal gland also increased after reserpine and this elevation in enzyme
was blocked by interrupting the splanchnic nerve85.
    Because of the increasing implications of catecholamines in behavioral
 changes we examined the effects of psychosocial deprivation and stimulation
 on the biosynthetic enzymes tyrosine hydroxylase, and PNMT86. One group
 of mice was isolated to prevent visual contact and another was exposed to in-


462                      1970 JULIUS AXELROD

creased social stimulation by a specially designed cage system. After six
months a marked decrease in adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT activ-
ity occurred in the deprived mice and an increase in both these enzymes was
found in the stimulated mice. In related experiments in Kopin’s laboratory it
was also observed that prolonged forced immobilization in rats also produced
a rise in adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT activities, and this elevation
was abolished by interrupting the splanchnic nerve to the adrenal87. All these
results suggest that the increase in the catecholamine-forming enzymes in
sustained stress may be neuronally mediated and that this response is not im-
mediate, as in the case of a sudden discharge of noradrenaline and adrenaline
in states of anger, fear or aggression.



            Noradrenaline as a neurochemical transducer in the pineal gland

 The pineal gland is exceedingly rich in sympathetic nerve fibers which origi-
 nate in the superior cervical ganglia88. This organ has the unique capacity to
 synthesize the hormone melatonin (5 -methoxy-N-acetyltryptamine)as fol-
 lows: tryptophan        5 - hydroxytryptophan      serotonin + N-acetylsero-
 tonin      melatonin89. A year before the discovery of melantonin by Lerner90
 we found an O-methylating enzyme, COMT7. This stimulated a search for
 the enzyme that O-methylates indoles to form melatonin. Such an enzyme
 was found in the pineal gland and named hydroxyindole-O-methyltrans-
 ferase 29. The enzyme O-methylates N-acetylserotonin to form melatonin,
 S-adenosylmethionine serving as the methyl donor. At about the same time
 the enzyme (N-acetyltransferase) that acetylates serotonin to N-acetylsero-
 tonin was desdribed91. The latter enzyme subsequently proved to be critical
 in the control of melatonin by the adrenergic nervous system. That environ-
 mental lighting had something to do with the pineal was suggested by Fiske92
 in 1961 when she found that continuous light changed the weight of the organ.
 Consequently rats were placed in continuous darkness or light and activity of
 the melatonin forming enzyme hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase in the
 pineal was measured93. In constant darkness the hydroxyindole-O-methyl-
 transferase activity in the pineal was more than twice as great as that in con-
 stant light. Removal of the superior cervical ganglia abolished this difference
in enzyme activity94. Since noradrenaline is the neurotransmitter of the sym-
 pathetic nerves, it might be the agent involved in controlling melatonin syn-
 thesis. This possibility was reinforced by the demonstration that levels of nor-

  adrenaline in the pineal are markedly influenced by environmental lightin gas.
  A possible approach to an examination of the mechanism whereby the neuro-
  transmitter could influence the synthesis of melatonin (which occurs outside
  the neurone) was to use pineals in organ culture. Mainly through the efforts
  of Shein, we succeeded in growing pineal gland in organ culture. The pineal
  in organ culture was capable of carrying out all the steps in the formation of
  melatonin from tryptophan . Inhibition of protein synthesis completely

  stopped the conversion of tryptophan to melatonin, indicating that new en-
  zyme protein was being formed. Addition of noradrenaline to the culture
  medium resulted in a sharp increase of melatonin, but not serotonin forma-
  tion97 from tryptophan over a period of 24 h (Fig. 10). However, noradren-




  tubes of pineal gland of rats were incubated with [ 14C]tryptophan in the absence or
  presence of noradrenaline (3 · 10-4 M). After 24 h the pineal cultures were assayed for
                          [14C]serotonin and [14C]melatonin 97.

 aline had only a marginal effect on the hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase
 activity. Klein et al. examined the enzyme that converts serotonin into N-
 acetylserotonin in pineal organ culture. He found that noradrenaline causes
 remarkable increase in the activity of this enzyme98. When protein synthesis
 was blocked, noradrenaline no longer stimulated the N-acetyhransferase ac-
 tivity. These results show that noradrenaline released from sympathetic
 nerves stimulates the formation of the pineal hormone melatonin by specifi-
 cally increasing the synthesis of new N-acetyltransferase molecules.



                          Concluding remarks

Since the demonstration by Otto Loewi99 that sympathetic nerves exert their
effects by the release of a chemical substance, numerous advances have oc-

curred. The neurotransmitter has been identified as noradrenaline and its bio-
synthesis, metabolism and inactivation elucidated. Although the complexities
of the storage, release and regulation of noradrenaline and adrenaline have
been partially unravelled, much remains to be done. Our understanding of
central adrenergic mechanisms is still at the early stages but shows great prom-
ise for rapid development. Drugs therapeutically effective in the treatment
of affective disorders and neurological and cardiovascular diseases have also
been shown to influence the uptake, storage, release, formation and metabo-
lism of catecholamines. These findings implicating the peripheral and central
synpathetic nervous system have provided insight into the causes and treat-
ment of mental depression , Parkinson’s disease and hypertension .
