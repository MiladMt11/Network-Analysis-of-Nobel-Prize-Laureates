              1. THE NEUROTRANSMITTER RELEASE ENIGMA

              Synapses have a long history in science. Synapses were first functionally demon-
              strated by Emil duBois-Reymond (1818–1896), were morphologically identified
              by classical neuroanatomists such as Rudolf von Kölliker (1817–1905) and San-
              tiago Ramon y Cajal (1852–1934), and named in 1897 by Michael Foster (1836–
              1907). Although the chemical nature of synaptic transmission was already sug-
              gested by duBois-Reymond, it was long disputed because of its incredible speed.
              Over time, however, overwhelming evidence established that most synapses use
              chemical messengers called neurotransmitters, most notably with the pioneer-
              ing contributions by Otto Loewi (1873–1961), Henry Dale (1875–1968), Ulf
              von Euler (1905–1983), and Julius Axelrod (1912–2004). In parallel, arguably
              the most important advance to understanding how synapses work was provided
              by Bernard Katz (1911–2003), who elucidated the principal mechanism of syn-
              aptic transmission (Katz, 1969). Most initial studies on synapses were carried
              out on the neuromuscular junction, and central synapses have only come to the
              fore in recent decades. Here, major contributions by many scientists, including
              George Palade, Rodolfo Llinas, Chuck Stevens, Bert Sakmann, Eric Kandel, and
              Victor Whittaker, to name just a few, not only confirmed the principal results
              obtained in the neuromuscular junction by Katz, but also revealed that synapses

      exhibit an enormous diversity of properties as well as an unexpected capacity
      for plasticity.
           Arguably, the most important property of synaptic transmission is its speed.
      At most synapses, synaptic transmission lasts for only a few milliseconds. This
      amazing speed is crucial for the overall workings of the brain—how else could a
      goalkeeper react to a shot in less than a second, or a ballerina pirouette without
      crashing to the floor? Synapses differ dramatically from each other in properties
      such as strength and plasticity, but always operate by the same canonical prin-
      ciple to achieve this speed, as first elucidated by Bernard Katz. When an action
      potential travels down an axon, it depolarizes the nerve terminals and opens
      presynaptic Ca2+-channels. The in-flowing Ca2+ then triggers neurotransmitter
      release in less than a millisecond, with a delay of possibly less than 100 micro-
      seconds (Sabatini and Regehr, 1996). Amazingly given this speed, presynaptic
      neurotransmitter release is mediated by membrane traffic. Presynaptic termi-
      nals are chock-full with synaptic vesicles—uniformly small organelles with a 35
      nm diameter—that contain high concentrations of neurotransmitters. Release is
      triggered when Ca2+ induces the rapid fusion of these vesicles with the presyn-
      aptic plasma membrane at a specialized region, the so-called active zone. The
      active zone is located exactly opposite the postsynaptic density containing the
      neurotransmitter receptors; as a result, neurotransmitters are released directly
      onto their receptors (Fig. 1).
           The active zone is the organizing principle that ensures the speed and preci-
      sion of synaptic transmission. The active zone recruits and docks synaptic vesicles
      at the release sites, transforms synaptic vesicles into a fusion-competent ‘primed’
      state that is responsive to Ca2+-triggering of release, and tethers Ca2+-channels
      next to the docking sites (Südhof, 2012). By co-localizing Ca2+-channels and
      primed vesicles at the synaptic cleft, the active zone enables the tight coupling
      of neurotransmitter release to an action potential and directs neurotransmitter
      release to the synaptic cleft. After exocytosis, synaptic vesicles recycle by differ-
      ent pathways, including fast endocytic mechanisms that are sometimes referred
      to as ‘kiss-and-run’ (Ceccarelli et al., 1973), as well as slower endocytic mecha-
      nisms involving clathrin-coated pits (Heuser and Reese, 1973; Fig. 1).
           Compared to presynaptic neurotransmitter release, postsynaptic neu-
      rotransmitter reception is conceptually more straightforward since it is largely
      mediated by transmitter binding to ligand-gated ion channels. Postsynaptic
      ionotropic receptors are highly developed molecular machines that are clus-
      tered opposite to the presynaptic active zone, and quickly convert an extracel-
      lular neurotransmitter signal into an intracellular ionic signal (Fig. 1). The ap-
      parent simplicity of postsynaptic mechanisms, however, is deceptive because

              cycle in presynaptic terminals that mediates neurotransmitter release. Step 1, vesicles are
              replenished from endosomes or by recycling after exo- and endocytosis, and are filled
              with neurotransmitters (NT); Step 2, vesicles are transported to the active zone of the pre-
              synaptic plasma membrane, where they reside in a cluster ready to be recruited for exo-
              cytosis; Step 3, vesicles are tethered to the presynaptic active zone in a ‘docking’ reaction
              that depends on the synaptic vesicle proteins Rab3/27 and the active zone protein RIM
              (see Fig. 14); Step 4, vesicles are ‘primed’ to render them competent for Ca2+-triggered
              fusion; Step 5, Ca2+ triggers fusion-pore opening, releasing the neurotransmitters; Steps
              6–8, vesicles recycle locally immediately after fusion-pore opening (6, ‘kiss-and-stay’), by
              endocytosis via a rapid pathway that is likely clathrin-independent (7, ‘kiss-and-run’), or
              by a clathrin-dependent pathway that involves an endosomal intermediate (8). Note that
              most of the recycling pathways were worked out in classical studies by Heuser and Reese
              (1973), Ceccarelli et al. (1973), and Zimmermann and Whittaker (1977). Drawing was
              adapted from Südhof and Jahn (1991) and Südhof (2004).



              postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors are subject to complex regulatory
              processes, including vesicular trafficking, that are incompletely understood.
              Moreover, postsynaptic signal-transduction pathways are organized in a sophis-
              ticated and compartmentalized manner that differs between various types of
              synapses. Considering the simple yet complex canonical design of a chemical
              synapse, one cannot but marvel at the ingenuity of this design that enables the
              requisite speed and plasticity of synaptic transmission using specialized pre-
              and postsynaptic machineries.

          When I started my laboratory in 1986, neurotransmitter release had been
      described in exquisite physiological detail. However, there was no mechanistic
      understanding, not even a hypothesis, of how synaptic vesicles might fuse, how
      Ca2+ could possibly trigger such fusion so rapidly, and how the release machin-
      ery is organized by the presynaptic active zone. No molecular component of the
      release machinery had been characterized, and no conceptual framework was
      available to explain the extraordinary plasticity and precision of Ca2+-triggered
      release. I focused on these questions, as opposed to studying postsynaptic neu-
      rotransmitter reception, because I was mesmerized by the apparent incompre-
      hensibility of the speed of Ca2+-triggered release, and intrigued by the general
      implications of understanding release for other membrane-trafficking reactions,
      such as hormone secretion.
          In the following, I will provide a brief personal overview of what we found.
      I will present our work in the context of that of others which was indispensable
      for our progress, but given space constraints I will not be able to do justice to
      the many important contributions made by others. We performed our studies as
      part of a larger scientific community working on this problem, and I will try to
      provide as balanced an account of the field as I can within my space allowance.


      2. MOLECULAR ANATOMY OF THE PRESYNAPTIC TERMINAL

      When we started, we chose a simple approach to the understanding of neu-
      rotransmitter release: to isolate and clone all major proteins of presynaptic ter-
      minals. Largely in collaboration with Reinhard Jahn, we first focused on synap-
      tic vesicles because they could be obtained at high yield and purity (Whittaker
      and Sheridan, 1965; Südhof and Jahn, 1991). Later on, we expanded this ap-
      proach to the presynaptic active zone. With these initial experiments, we aimed
      to assemble a molecular catalogue of presynaptic proteins as a starting point for
      a functional dissection of release.
           The first synaptic vesicle proteins we purified and cloned were synapto-
      physin (Südhof et al., 1987), cytochrome b561 (Perin et al., 1988), synapsins
      (Südhof et al., 1989a), synaptobrevins (Südhof et al., 1989b; also independently
      cloned by R.H. Scheller and named vesicle-associated membrane protein
      [VAMP]; Trimble et al., 1988), proton pump components (Südhof et al., 1989c;
      Perin et al., 1991), and synaptotagmins (Perin et al., 1990; Geppert et al., 1991;
      Li et al., 1995). In addition, we found that Rab3 proteins, the brain’s most abun-
      dant GTP-binding proteins originally identified as ras-homologous sequences
      (Touchot et al., 1987), are associated with synaptic vesicles (von Mollard et al.,

              Figure 2. Diagram of synaptic vesicle proteins involved in neurotransmitter release as seen
              in 1991. At the beginning of the effort to map the molecular anatomy of synaptic vesicles,
              five major classes of synaptic vesicle proteins were identified: the synapsins that were at
              that time thought to be major candidates for regulating neurotransmitter release (Süd-
              hof et al., 1989a), Rab3 proteins (von Mollard et al., 1990), synaptophysins (Südhof et
              al., 1987), synaptotagmins (Perin et al., 1990), and synaptobrevins/VAMPs (Südhof et
              al., 1989b). Of these proteins, three classes (Rab3, synaptotagmins, and synaptobrevins)
              turned out to be crucial for release in subsequent studies (reproduced from Südhof and
              Jahn, 1991).



              1990), and that Rab3 proteins cycle on and off synaptic vesicles during exocyto-
              sis (von Mollard et al., 1991).
                   Thus, in the beginning of the 1990s a fairly comprehensive characterization
              of the synaptic vesicle as an organelle had emerged (Südhof and Jahn, 1991; Fig.
              2). Subsequently, we and others cloned a series of additional vesicle proteins, in-
              cluding SVOP (Janz et al., 1998) and SCAMPs (Fernandez-Chacon et al., 2000).
              Furthermore, we expanded our attempts to molecularly characterize the release
              machinery to the active zone, and identified Munc18s (Hata et al., 1993), com-
              plexins (McMahon et al., 1995), Munc13s (Brose et al., 1995), CASK (Hata et al.,
              1996), RIMs (Wang et al., 1997), RIM-BPs (Wang et al., 2000), and ELKS (Wang
              et al., 2002; independently described by Ohtsuka et al., 2002). These studies were
              complemented by those of others identifying as active-zone proteins α-liprins

      1999; Fenster et al., 2000).
           After having elucidated the primary structures of a growing number of syn-
      aptic proteins, we faced the challenge of determining their functions. We decided
      to examine these molecules broadly in an un-biased manner as systematically
      as possible, and used a combination of methods ranging from biochemistry and
      cell biology to structural biology, mouse genetics, and electrophysiology.
           As I will describe in the following account, these studies enabled a new un-
      derstanding of neurotransmitter release. However, not all efforts were produc-
      tive, and not all abundant and conserved synaptic proteins were found to be im-
      portant. For example, prominent proteins such as synapsins and synaptophysins
      turned out to have only ancillary roles in the synaptic vesicle cycle that may be
      important for the overall organism, but are not essential for the basic process of
      synaptic vesicle exo- and endocytosis (e.g., Rosahl et al., 1993 and 1995; Janz et
      al., 1999).
           In the following description, I will divide neurotransmitter release into three
      processes, membrane fusion as the basic mechanism that mediates release by
      synaptic vesicle exocytosis, Ca2+-triggering as the key event that enables fast
      synaptic transmission, and the spatial organization of the release machinery by
      the active zone that allows precise coupling of a presynaptic action potential to
      a postsynaptic response.



      3. MECHANISM OF SYNAPTIC MEMBRANE FUSION

      SNARE Proteins in Fusion
      The first insights into how synaptic vesicles fuse with the presynaptic plasma
      membrane during neurotransmitter release came from studies of tetanus and
      botulinum toxins. These neurotoxins, which as disease agents cause tetanus and
      botulism but also have great therapeutic value, are among the most powerful
      neurotoxins known (Grumelli et al., 2005). Tetanus and botulinum toxins are
      metalloproteases that block neurotransmitter release at nanomolar concentra-
      tions by arresting the fusion of synaptic vesicles with the presynaptic plasma
      membrane.
          In 1992, studies in Cesare Montecucco’s, Heiner Niemann’s, and Reinhard
      Jahn’s laboratories—to which we contributed—showed that tetanus toxin and
      botulinum B toxin block synaptic vesicle fusion by proteolytic cleavage of Syn-

              two other presynaptic membrane proteins, SNAP-25 and Syntaxin-1 (Blasi et
              al., 1993a and 1993b; Schiavo et al., 1993). Moreover, we demonstrated that a
              ubiquitously distributed synaptobrevin isoform (Cellubrevin) is also a tetanus
              toxin substrate, suggesting that the inhibition of vesicle fusion by tetanus toxin-
              dependent cleavage of Synaptobrevin-2 reflects a general function of synapto-
              brevin-like molecules in membrane fusion (McMahon et al., 1993). Together,
              these findings provided the first, and arguably still most compelling evidence
              that Synaptobrevin-2, SNAP-25, and Syntaxin-1 are essential components of the
              presynaptic membrane fusion machinery. As we will see now, evidence about
              how these proteins, later named SNARE proteins (for ‘soluble NSF-attachment
              protein receptors’), might work came from parallel studies in James Rothman’s
              laboratory.
                   Rothman had been studying membrane fusion by biochemically reconstitut-
              ing vesicular traffic between compartments of the Golgi apparatus (Balch et al.,
              1984). Using this assay, Rothman isolated an N-ethyl maleimide-sensitive factor
              (referred to as NSF) and NSF-adaptor proteins that attach NSF to membranes
              (referred to as SNAPs, an unfortunate coincidence of acronyms with SNAP-25).
              Both NSF and SNAPs were essential for in vitro fusion in Rothman’s assay, and
              were found to be homologous to yeast genes involved in secretion, suggesting
              a fundamental function in membrane traffic (Wilson et al., 1989; Clary et al.,
              1990). In a crucial study, Rothman’s laboratory then used immobilized NSF
              and SNAPs as an affinity matrix to purify SNAP ‘receptors’ (i.e., SNAREs) from
              brain because brain was the richest source of such receptors. He isolated Syn-
              aptobrevin-2, Syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25, just as these proteins were revealed to
              be tetanus and botulinum toxin substrates (Söllner et al., 1993a). Subsequently,
              Rothman went on to show in collaboration with Richard Scheller that Synap-
              tobrevin-2, Syntaxin-1, and SNAP-25 formed a complex with each other, and
              that this complex is dissociated by NSF which acts as an ATPase (Söllner et
              al., 1993b). This brilliant experiment provided an explanation for how these
              proteins might work in fusion, although it took many more years to formulate
              a compelling mechanism for their fusion function. Collaborating with Heiner
              Niemann, we found that SNARE complexes are SDS-resistant and extremely
              tight, and that only the SNARE complex but not individual SNARE proteins
              binds to SNAPs and NSF, while only free SNARE proteins but not SNARE pro-
              teins in the complex are substrates for botulinum and tetanus toxins (Hayashi et
              al., 1994; McMahon et al., 1995a).
                   Viewed together, these studies suggested to us that formation of SNARE
              complexes between the synaptic vesicle and presynaptic plasma membranes
              may mediate fusion, but the mechanism of fusion was unclear. One hypothesis

      was that NSF and SNAPs are the actual fusion proteins, and that SNARE pro-
      teins ensure the specificity of the fusion reaction mediated by NSF and SNAPs
      by acting as their receptors after SNARE complexes have assembled (Söllner
      et al., 1993a and 1993b). An alternative idea that we favored was motivated by
      the botulinum and tetanus toxin data, and stated that SNARE proteins, espe-
      cially synaptobrevin, are actually directly involved in fusion, although we did
      not know by what mechanism (Südhof et al., 1993).
          Two subsequent key experiments clarified the question whether NSF/
      SNAPs or SNAREs are the actual membrane-fusion proteins. First, Bill Wick-
      ner’s laboratory elegantly showed in yeast vacuole fusion assays that yeast NSF
      does not function in fusion, but is only required to activate SNARE proteins for
      fusion and to recycle the SNARE machinery after fusion (Mayer et al., 1996).
      Second, in a seminal experiment Reinhard Jahn and John Heuser demonstrated
      that SNARE complexes assemble in a parallel manner, such that SNARE-com-
      plex assembly forces the C-terminal transmembrane regions of SNARE proteins
      into close proximity (Hanson et al., 1997). This key observation by Heuser and
      Jahn provided an immediate model for how SNARE proteins may mediate fu-
      sion, namely by zippering up in an N- to C-terminal direction, thereby forcing
      membranes that contain their C-terminal transmembrane regions into close
      proximity. This model was quickly confirmed using biophysical studies and
      crystallography (Lin and Scheller, 1997; Poirier et al., 1998, Sutton et al., 1998),
      and further elaborated by Rothman and others using in vitro reconstitution ex-
      periments with liposomes (Weber et al., 1998). It is now the standard model of
      the field.


      SM proteins are obligatory SNARE partners in membrane fusion
      In 1993, just at the time at which SNARE proteins were being discovered as
      membrane fusion proteins, we searched for other components of the fusion ma-
      chinery using affinity chromatography on immobilized Syntaxin-1 (Hata et al.,
      1993). We isolated a 65 kDa protein that we named Munc18-1 because of its
      sequence homology to the C. elegans unc18 gene (Fig. 3A). Sidney Brenner had
      isolated unc18-mutants because the mutant worms did not move properly (were
      ‘uncoordinated’), but the function of the unc18 gene was unknown (Brenner,
      1974). However, because Munc18 bound to the SNARE membrane-fusion ma-
      chinery and because C. elegans unc18 was essential for movement, we hypoth-
      esized that Munc18-1 was an intrinsic component of the fusion machinery, and
      co-operates with SNARE proteins in fusion (Fig. 3A).

                   Further analyses revealed that Munc18-1 was also homologous to sec1,
              which was the first gene isolated by Peter Novick and Randy Schekman in
              screens for secretory yeast mutants, but whose function, like that of the previ-
              ously described unc18, was unknown (Novick and Schekman, 1979). In fact,
              this homology led some investigators to refer to Munc18-1 as n-sec1 or rb-sec1
              (Garcia et al., 1994, Pevsner et al., 1994). Multiple additional homologs of Sec1p
              and Munc18 were subsequently described, and the whole gene family is now
              referred to as Sec1/Munc18-like proteins (SM proteins; Rizo and Südhof, 2012).
                   After the discovery of Munc18-1, considerable confusion reigned about its
              function, fueled by paradoxical observations. On the one hand, in yeast sec1
              mutations blocked fusion (Novick and Schekman, 1979), in Drosophila dele-
              tion of the Munc18-1 gene (rop) abolished synaptic transmission (Harrison
              et al., 1994), and in mice knockout of Munc18-1 ablated neurotransmitter re-
              lease (Verhage et al., 2000; Fig. 3B). These results suggested an essential role for
              Munc18-1 in fusion itself, a hypothesis that was further supported by Novick’s
              elegant studies demonstrating that yeast Sec1p binds to assembled SNARE com-
              plexes (Carr et al., 1999), and acts downstream of SNARE-complex assembly
              (Grote et al., 2000). On the other hand, we found that outside of the SNARE
              complex, Syntaxin-1 assumes a ‘closed’ conformation in which its N-terminal
              Habc-domain folds back on its SNARE-motif, and that Munc18-1 specifically
              binds to this closed conformation of Syntaxin-1 (Dulubova et al., 1999). Habc-
              domains are a conserved feature of syntaxins, and account for half of their se-
              quences, while the SNARE motifs of synaxins form SNARE complexes by as-
              sembling with similar SNARE motifs in synaptobrevins and SNAP-25 or their
              homologs into a four-helical bundle (Fig. 3C; Fernandez et al., 1998; Sutton et
              al., 1998). As a result, the intramolecular interaction in the closed Syntaxin-1
              conformation of the N-terminal Habc-domain with the SNARE motif prevents
              Syntaxin-1 from assembling into SNARE complexes, suggesting that Munc18-1
              may be a negative regulator of SNARE-complex assembly. Thus, paradoxically at
              this junction Munc18-1 seemed to be at the same time essential for fusion itself
              and preventing fusion by blocking SNARE-complex assembly.
                   We found a resolution to this apparent contradiction when we observed
              in collaboration with Josep Rizo that both in vertebrates and in yeast, the SM
              protein involved in vesicular transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the
              Golgi apparatus (Sly1) binds to its cognate syntaxins (Syntaxin-5 and -18 in
              vertebrates, and Sed5p and Ufe1p in yeast) via a short, conserved N-terminal
              peptide (the ‘N-peptide’; Yamaguchi et al., 2002; Figs. 3C and 3D). We also
              found that the same mechanism applies to another SM protein—Vps45—that

              is involved in endosome and trans-Golgi fusion, and that binds to its cognate
              Syntaxin-16 (Tlg2p in yeast) again via a very similar N-peptide sequence (Du-
              lubova et al., 2002). Owing to this binding mechanism, these SM proteins could
              remain associated with their cognate syntaxins throughout SNARE-complex
              assembly, consistent with Novick’s studies on Sec1p (Grote et al., 2000; note,
              however, that the details of Sec1p binding in yeast to the SNARE complex may
              differ). We observed that the vertebrate plasma membrane syntaxins contain an
              extremely similar conserved N-terminal sequence (Fig. 3D), prompting us to
              search for a similar binding mode of Munc18-1 to Syntaxin-1.

              homologous sequences present in synaptobrevins and SNAP-25 or their homologs, and
              a C-terminal transmembrane region (TMR). Outside of the SNARE complex, syntaxins
              spontaneously form a ‘closed’ conformation in which the N-terminal Habc-domain folds
              back onto the SNARE motif, thereby occluding this motif and hindering SNARE-com-

              ing the full N-terminal sequence of Syntaxin-1 were analyzed alone (black and blue
              traces, respectively), or Munc18-1 was analyzed together with SNARE complexes con-
              taining either the full N-terminal Syntaxin-1 sequence (red trace) or N-terminally trun-
              cated Syntaxin-1 lacking 8 residues (green trace). Note that in the presence of SNARE
              complexes containing full-length Syntaxin-1, most Munc18-1 co-elutes with SNARE
              complexes, whereas in the presence of SNARE complexes containing N-terminally trun-
              cated Syntaxin-1, no Munc18-1 co-elutes with the SNARE complexes (reproduced from
              Dulubova et al., 2007).

          Indeed, we found that Munc18-1 bound tightly to assembled SNARE com-
      plexes in a manner that depended on the Syntaxin-1 N-peptide (Fig. 3E; Du-
      lubova et al., 2007). The Munc18-1/SNARE-complex assembly was stable dur-
      ing size-exclusion chromatography, but disrupted by deletion of the N-peptide
      from Syntaxin-1 (Fig. 3E; note that James Rothman’s laboratory simultaneously
      made similar observations [Shen et al., 2007]). Fusing as little as a Myc-epitope
      to the N-peptide of Syntaxin-1 impaired this binding mode, whereas binding of
      Munc18-1 to the monomeric closed conformation of Syntaxin-1 did not require
      the Syntaxin-1 N-peptide.
          Viewed together, these results showed that Munc18-1 binds to Syntaxin-1
      in two sequential modes that involve different Syntaxin-1 conformations (Fig.
      4): an exocytosis-specific binding mode in which Munc18-1 binds to ‘closed’
      Syntaxin-1 independent of the N-peptide (Dulubova et al., 1999), and a general




      Figure 4. Conformational changes of SNARE and SM proteins mediating synaptic vesicle
      fusion. Prior to fusion, Syntaxin-1 assumes a default ‘closed’ conformation that binds
      Munc18-1 via an interaction which does not require the Syntaxin-1 N-peptide (Du-
      lubova et al., 1999). In Reaction A, Syntaxin-1 is ‘opened’ (probably by Munc13-medi-
      ated catalysis; Ma et al., 2011) to initiate synaptic vesicle priming. In Reaction B, SNARE
      complexes partially assemble via N- to C-terminal zippering (Hanson et al., 1997), while
      Munc18-1 stays associated with Syntaxin-1 during SNARE-complex assembly via its
      binding to the Syntaxin-1 N-peptide (Khvotchev et al., 2007). In Reaction C, Ca2+-trig-
      gers fusion-pore opening by stimulating the completion of SNARE-complex assembly;
      Munc18-1 contributes to this process and is required for fusion-pore opening during this
      step because the continuing association of Munc18-1 with SNARE-complexes is essential
      for fusion-pore opening (Zhou et al., 2013a). After fusion, vesicles are endocytosed (see
      Fig. 1), and SNARE complexes are disassembled by the NSF ATPase and its SNAP pro-
      tein adaptor (no relation to the SNARE protein SNAP-25). Munc18-1 remains associated
      with Syntaxin-1, and reverts to the heterodimeric interaction with ‘closed’ Syntaxin-1.
      Thus, there are two major conformational transitions during exocytotic membrane fu-
      sion: opening of Syntaxin-1 with rearrangement of the mode of Munc18-1 binding, and
      folding of SNARE proteins into SNARE complexes.

              binding mode shared with some other SM protein/SNARE complex interactions
              in which Munc18-1 binds to ‘open’ Syntaxin-1 assembled into SNARE com-
              plexes via the Syntaxin-1 N-peptide, and additionally interacts with other parts
              of the SNARE complex (Dulubova et al., 2007).
                   What are the functions of the two Munc18-1 binding modes to SNARE pro-
              teins, and which of the two modes is more important for fusion? Initial peptide
              competition experiments in the calyx-of-Held synapse showed that displac-
              ing the Syntaxin-1 N-terminus from Munc18-1 impairs synaptic vesicle fusion
              (Khvotchev et al., 2007). Further studies described that mutations in Munc18-1
              which decrease Munc18-1 binding to the Syntaxin-1 N-terminal sequences also
              decrease fusion (Deak et al., 2009). It should be noted that in a later study in
              which this result was disputed using similar but weaker mutations (Meijer et
              al., 2012), the Munc18-1 mutations caused only a partial decrease in binding to
              the Syntaxin-1 N-peptide. In these studies, all physiology was performed with
              a high degree of overexpression, which could have easily compensated for the
              decrease in binding affinity. Furthermore, elegant experiments in C. elegans re-
              vealed that the Syntaxin-1 N-peptide was essential for fusion, but that it did not
              actually need to be on Syntaxin-1 in order to function, as long as it was posi-
              tioned close to SNARE complexes (Rathore et al., 2010). Finally, we showed that
              in mammalian synapses, the Syntaxin-1 N-peptide was also required for fusion
              under physiological conditions (Zhou et al., 2013b).
                   These experiments show that binding of Munc18-1 to ‘open’ Syntaxin-1
              within the SNARE complex is essential for fusion, and validate the function of
              Munc18-1—analogous to that of Sec1p—as an intrinsic component of the fu-
              sion machine. What then is the role of Munc18-1 binding to ‘closed’ Syntaxin-1?
              To test this role, we created knock-in mice in which Syntaxin-1 was rendered
              constitutively ‘open’ (Syntaxin-1Open), and thus binding of Munc18-1 to ‘closed’
              Syntaxin-1 was suppressed (Gerber et al., 2008). In these mice, both Munc18-1
              and Syntaxin-1 were destabilized and decreased in levels, consistent with other
              evidence suggesting that the complex of Munc18-1 with the closed conforma-
              tion of Syntaxin-1 stabilizes both proteins (Verhage et al., 2000). The decreased
              levels of Syntaxin-1 and Munc18-1 in Syntaxin-1Open synapses resulted in de-
              creased vesicle priming, presumably because fewer slots for vesicle fusion were
              available (Gerber et al., 2008; Acuna et al., 2014).
                   Nevertheless, the probability of Ca2+-triggered neurotransmitter release
              was dramatically enhanced in Syntaxin-1Open synapses, and fusion was acceler-
              ated. Even the fusion of individual vesicles, as judged by the kinetics of single
              miniature release (‘mini’) events, was faster in Syntaxin-1Open than in wild-type
              synapses (Acuna et al., 2014). These data, together with the finding that the

      Habc-domain of Syntaxin-1, different from its N-peptide, is not essential for
      fusion (Zhou et al., 2013a) demonstrate that Munc18-1 binding to the closed
      conformation of Syntaxin-1 is not required for fusion, whereas binding to ‘open’
      Syntaxin-1 in the SNARE complex is essential for fusion. Binding of Munc18-1
      to closed Syntaxin-1 appears to serve two other functions that are not directly
      part of fusion itself: to stabilize both proteins in the complex, and to ‘gate’
      SNARE-complex assembly mediating fusion, i.e., to regulate the rate of fusion.


      How do SNARE and SM proteins mediate fusion?
      In principle, SNARE proteins act in fusion via a simple mechanism: SNARE
      proteins are attached to both membranes destined to fuse, and form a trans-
      complex that involves a progressive zippering of the four-helical SNARE-com-
      plex bundle in an N- to C-terminal direction, forcing the fusing membranes
      into close proximity and destabilizing their surfaces. This opens a fusion pore,
      whose expansion then converts the initial ‘trans’-SNARE complexes into ‘cis’-
      SNARE complexes which are subsequently dissociated by the NSF and SNAP
      adapter proteins, thereby allowing a recycling of the vesicles and the SNARE
      proteins for another round of fusion (Fig. 4).
          However, at least two major questions arise at this point. First, do SNARE
      proteins primarily act as force-generators to pull membranes together (which
      may be sufficient for inducing in vitro fusion), or do SNARE proteins actually
      open the fusion pore? Second, what is the precise function of SM proteins in
      fusion—why are they required?
          In vitro, the transmembrane regions of synaptobrevin and Syntaxin-1 inter-
      act with each other in the plane of the membrane. The SNARE motifs of these
      proteins form a continuous, rigid a-helix with their transmembrane regions,
      suggesting that the SNARE protein transmembrane regions may actively con-
      tribute to the fusion pore (Stein et al., 2009). However, in recent experiments
      we found that Synaptobrevin-2 and Syntaxin-1 still mediate fusion when both
      are attached to their resident membranes via lipid anchors, not transmembrane
      regions, demonstrating that SNARE transmembrane regions are not essential
      components of the fusion machine (Zhou et al., 2013b). These results support
      the notion that SNARE proteins act as force generators, and that their trans-
      membrane regions do not act as fusion catalysts.
          What then do SM proteins do in fusion? The fact that SM proteins are re-
      quired continuously during SNARE-complex assembly argues for a role either
      in organizing proper SNARE-complex assembly and in preventing dead-end

              inappropriate SNARE complexes, or in catalyzing lipid mixing during fusion.
              At present, no conclusive data argue one way or the other, and this question will
              clearly keep many of us busy for years to come.


              SNARE chaperones are essential for maintaining the integrity of the presynaptic
              terminal
              Neurons fire action potentials often in bursts or trains, with high frequencies,
              sometimes exceeding 100 Hz. Each neurotransmitter release event involves the
              folding and unfolding of reactive SNARE proteins, exposing the presynaptic cy-
              tosol to potentially deleterious misfolding of SNARE proteins and formation of
              inappropriate complexes by reactive SNARE motifs. It is thus not surprising that
              neurons express specialized chaperones which help proper folding of SNARE
              proteins, and that deletion of these chaperones leads to neurodegeneration.
                   We identified two classes of such chaperones, CSPα (for cysteine-string
              protein-α, so named because it contains an eponymous string of cysteine resi-
              dues that are palmitoylated to attach CSPα to the synaptic vesicle membrane;
              Gundersen et al., 1994), and synucleins (so named because it was initially
              thought that these presynaptic proteins may also be in the nucleus; Maroteaux
              et al., 1988).
                   Our discovery that these proteins function as SNARE chaperones was pure
              serendipity. We found that deletion of CSPα in mice leads to massive neuro-
              degeneration that kills affected mice in 3-4 months and is caused by an im-
              pairment in SNARE-complex formation (Fernandez-Chacon et al., 2004). Sur-
              prisingly, this neurodegeneration was suppressed by modest overexpression
              of α-synuclein (Chandra et al., 2005). Following up on these observations, we
              showed that CSPα—which contains a DNA-J domain and forms a catalytically
              active, ATP-dependent chaperone complex with Hsc70 and the tetratricopep-
              tide-repeat protein SGT (Tobaben et al., 2000)—catalyzes the proper folding
              of SNAP-25, rendering SNAP-25 competent for SNARE-complex assem-
              bly (Sharma et al., 2011a, 2011b, and 2012). In CSPα KO mice, misfolding of
              SNAP-25 impaired SNARE-complex assembly which then caused neurodegen-
              eration. α-Synuclein rescued this neurodegeneration by independently promot-
              ing SNARE-complex assembly via a non-classical, ATP-independent chaperone
              activity (Burre et al., 2010).
                   Although these observations uncovered a potentially interesting facet of
              SNARE protein biology, we do not yet understand how the physiological ac-
              tivities of α-synuclein relate to its neurotoxic role in Parkinson’s disease. One

      attractive hypothesis is that α-synuclein aggregation in Parkinson’s disease may
      deplete neurons of all available functional α-synuclein, and thus cause SNARE
      protein misfolding that is then deleterious, but alternative hypotheses, such as
      a direct neurotoxic non-physiological activity of α-synuclein oligomers, are

      4. Ca 2+ -TRIGGERING OF FUSION: SYNAPTOTAGMINS AND MORE

      At the same time as our work on synaptic membrane fusion was progressing, we
      were studying a related question: how is neurotransmitter release by synaptic
      membrane fusion triggered by Ca2+? Ever since I was a graduate student in Vic-
      tor Whittaker’s laboratory in Göttingen, I had been fascinated by this question.
      The central importance of Ca2+-triggered neurotransmitter release for brain
      function intrigued me, its improbable speed and plasticity puzzled me, and the
      similarity of Ca2+-induced synaptic vesicle exocytosis to other types of Ca2+-
      induced exocytosis, such as those underlying hormone secretion, mast cell de-
      granulation, or fertilization, suggested to me that understanding Ca2+-triggered
      neurotransmitter release may be generally relevant for cellular signaling pro-
      cesses. Although some key discoveries about synaptotagmins were made at the
      same time as those about SNARE and SM proteins, the work on synaptotagmins
      extended over a longer time period to satisfy even the most stringent critics, and
      some of the most important observations are quite recent.


      Discovery of Synaptotagmin-1: identification of C2-domains as versatile Ca2+-binding
      domains
      During our studies of the molecular anatomy of synaptic vesicles, we searched
      for a candidate Ca2+-sensor that might mediate Ca2+-triggering of synaptic ves-
      icle exocytosis. When we purified and cloned Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1)—which
      had been described earlier as a synaptic vesicle protein using a monoclonal anti-
      body raised against synaptosomes (Matthew et al., 1981)—we were intrigued by
      its primary structure because Syt1 included two C2-domains that were anchored
      on the vesicle membrane by a transmembrane region (Perin et al., 1990; Figs. 2
      and 5A). At that time, nothing was known about C2-domains except that they
      represented the “2nd constant sequence” in classical protein-kinase C (PKC) iso-
      zymes (Coussens et al., 1986). Since classical PKC isozymes are Ca2+-regulated
      and interact with phospholipids, we speculated that the synaptotagmin C2-
      domains may represent Ca2+-binding modules that interact with phospholip-
      ids, and that Syt1 may be a Ca2+-sensor for neurotransmitter release (Perin et

              The Molecular Machinery of Neurotransmitter Release275


              al., 1990). In pursuing this hypothesis over two decades, we showed that Ca2+-
              triggering of neurotransmitter release is mediated by Ca2+-binding to Syt1 and
              other synaptotagmins, and that different synaptotagmin isoforms additionally
              perform similar Ca2+-sensor functions in other types of Ca2+-dependent exocy-
              tosis in neuronal and non-neuronal cells.
                   The first challenge after describing Syt1 was to test whether the Syt1 C2-
              domains were indeed a novel type of Ca2+/phospholipid-binding domain. We
              found that the Syt1 C2-domains bound to phospholipids (Perin et al., 1990),
              that such binding was mediated by purified brain Syt1 in a Ca2+-dependent
              manner (Brose et al., 1992), and that a single C2-domain of Syt1—the first ‘C2A-
              domain—constituted an autonomously folded domain that bound Ca2+ and
              phospholipids in a ternary complex (Davletov and Südhof, 1993 and 1994; Fig.
              5B). In addition, we and others observed that the Syt1 C2-domains also bind to
              Syntaxin-1 and to SNARE-complexes as a function of Ca2+ (Li et al., 1995a and
              1995b; Chapman et al., 1995). In collaboration with Steven Sprang and Josep
              Rizo, we obtained atomic structures of the C2-domains of Syt1, and defined
              the architecture of their Ca2+-binding sites (Sutton et al., 1995; Shao et al., 1996
              and 1997; Ubach et 1998 and 2001; Fernandez et al., 2001; Fig. 5A). Our struc-
              tural studies demonstrated that the Syt1 C2-domains are composed of stable
              β-sandwiches with flexible loops emerging from the top and bottom, and that
              Ca2+ exclusively binds to the top loops of the C2-domains with incomplete co-
              ordination spheres (Figs. 5A and 5C). As a result, intrinsic Ca2+-binding to Syt1
              C2-domains exhibited low affinity, but was dramatically enhanced by binding
              of phospholipids which complete the Ca2+-coordination spheres (Davletov and
              Südhof, 1993 and 1994; Ubach et al., 1998 ; Fernandez et al., 2001).
                   The biochemical and structural definition of the Syt1 C2A-domain as an au-
              tonomously folded Ca2+-binding module − the first for any C2-domain—proved
              paradigmatic for all C2-domains, which are now known to represent a common
              Ca2+-binding motif found in many proteins (Rizo and Südhof, 1998; Corbalan-
              Garcia and Gómez-Fernández, 2014). However, not all C2-domains bind Ca2+.
              Some C2-domains are Ca2+-independent phospholipid-binding modules (e.g.,
              the PTEN C2-domain; Lee et al., 1999), while others are Ca2+-independent pro-
              tein interaction domains (e.g., the N-terminal C2-domain of Munc13 that binds
              to RIMs as discussed below; Dulubova et al., 2005; Lu et al., 2006). Even C2-do-
              mains that bind Ca2+ are functionally diverse. For example, different from Syt1
              C2-domains, some C2-domains exhibit a high intrinsic Ca2+-affinity also in the
              absence of phospholipids (e.g., the central C2-domain of Munc13-2; Shin et al.,
              2010). Thus, C2-domains are versatile protein modules that most often are Ca2+/
              phospholipid-binding domains but can adopt multifarious other functions.

              The Molecular Machinery of Neurotransmitter Release277


              Demonstration that Syt1 is a Ca2+-sensor for exocytosis
              After the biochemical studies had established that Syt1 binds Ca2+, the next
              challenge was to show whether Syt1 constitutes Katz’s long-sought Ca2+-sensor
              for neurotransmitter release. Initial experiments in C. elegans and Drosophila
              disappointingly indicated that at least some neurotransmitter release remained
              after deletion of Syt1, even though release was significantly reduced (Littleton
              et al., 1993; DiAntonio et al., 1993; Nonet et al., 1993). Our electrophysiological
              analyses of Syt1 knockout mice in which higher resolution measurements of re-
              lease were possible then revealed that Syt1 is selectively and absolutely required
              for fast synchronous synaptic fusion in forebrain neurons, whereas it is dispens-
              able for other, slower forms of Ca2+-induced release (Fig. 6; Geppert et al., 1994;
              Maximov and Südhof, 2005). These experiments, carried out in collaboration
              with Chuck Stevens at the Salk Institute, accounted for the Drosophila and C.
              elegans phenotypes, and established that Syt1 is essential for fast Ca2+-triggered
              release, but is not required for fusion as such—is not even necessary for all Ca2+-
              triggered fusion. Moreover, deletion of Syt1 increased spontaneous ‘mini’ re-
              lease in some synapses, suggesting that Syt1 normally contributes to clamping
              spontaneous synaptic vesicle exocytosis (Maximov and Südhof, 2005; Xu et al.,
              2009).
                  The Syt1 knockout analyses thus supported the ‘synaptotagmin Ca2+-sensor
              hypothesis’, but did not exclude the possibility that Syt1 positions vesicles next
              to voltage-gated Ca2+-channels (a function now known to be mediated by RIMs
              and RIM-BPs [Kaeser et al., 2011]). Such a ‘positioning function’ would enable
              another ‘real’ Ca2+-sensor to do the actual Ca2+-triggering, consistent with the
              remaining Ca2+-induced release in Syt1 knockout synapses—an alternative hy-
              pothesis that was widely discussed (Penner and Neher, 1994), but could not ac-
              count for why Syt1 itself binds Ca2+.

              residues.

      neurons cultured from newborn littermate wild-type (WT, left) and Syt1 knockout mice
      (right). Synaptic responses were induced by isolated action potentials; two different
      scales are shown under (i) and (ii) as indicated by the calibration bars. Note that the
      Syt1 knockout completely ablates fast synchronous response, but not slow asynchronous
      responses (reproduced from Geppert et al., 1994a).


          To directly test whether Ca2+-binding to Syt1 actually triggers neurotrans-
      mitter release, we introduced into the endogenous mouse Syt1 gene a point mu-
      tation (R233Q) that decreased the Syt1 Ca2+-binding affinity during phospho-
      lipid binding ~2-fold, but had no detectable effect on Ca2+-dependent Syntaxin-1
      binding (Figs. 7A and 7B; Fernandez-Chacon et al., 2001). Electrophysiological
      recordings, carried out in collaboration with Christian Rosenmund, revealed
      that the R233Q mutation converted synaptic depression during stimulus trains
      into synaptic facilitation, consistent with a decrease in release probability (Fig.
      7C). Importantly, this decrease in release probability was revealed to be caused
      by a ~2-fold decrease in the apparent Ca2+-affinity of neurotransmitter release,
      formally proving that Syt1 is the Ca2+-sensor for release (Fig. 7D).
          In subsequent studies, we extended this analysis, and introduced into
      knock-in mice other point mutations, including a mutation (D232N) that

              increased the Ca2+-dependent interaction of Syt1 with SNARE proteins (Fig.
              7E; Pang et al., 2006a). We found that this mutation increased neurotransmit-
              ter release accordingly. We showed in a detailed comparison of the R233Q and
              D232N point mutations, which decrease or increase the apparent Ca2+-affinity
              of Syt1, respectively, that they have corresponding opposite effects on the appar-
              ent Ca2+-affinity of release (Figs. 7F and 7G). Moreover, in parallel experiments
              in chromaffin cells performed in collaboration with Erwin Neher, we found that
              Syt1 also functions as a Ca2+-sensor for endocrine granule exocytosis (Voets
              et al., 2001; Sorensen et al., 2002), although here the Syt1 deletion causes only
              a very small impairment in Ca2+-triggered exocytosis because Syt1 function is
              largely redundant with that of Syt7 in chromaffin cells (Schonn et al., 2008; see
              discussion below).
                  Together, these studies proved that Syt1 functions as a Ca2+-sensor in syn-
              aptic vesicle exocytosis. We next wondered whether Ca2+-binding to both of
              the C2-domains of Syt1 contributes to triggering release. Initial studies in Dro-
              sophila demonstrated that the C2B-domain Ca2+-binding sites of Syt1 are es-
              sential for release (Mackler and Reist, 2001). A similar study suggested that the
              C2A-domain Ca2+-binding sites are dispensable (Robinson et al., 2002), but the
              signal-to-noise ratio of this study was too low to rule out a significant contri-
              bution of the C2A-domain. Using systematic rescue experiments to perform a
              direct quantitative comparison of the Ca2+-triggering activities of Syt1 mutants
              lacking either C2A- or C2B-domain Ca2+-binding sites, we found that in addi-
              tion to the C2B-domain Ca2+-binding sites, the C2A-domain Ca2+-binding sites
              significantly contribute to release (Shin et al., 2009). Moreover, we observed that
              in the absence of the C2A-domain Ca2+-binding sites, Ca2+-triggered release ex-
              hibited a significantly decreased apparent Ca2+-cooperativity, documenting that
              Ca2+-binding to the C2A-domain of Synaptotagmin-1 directly participates in
              the Ca2+-triggering of fast release.


              Diversity of synaptotagmins in fast Ca2+-triggered neurotransmitter release
              Mammalian genomes encode 16 synaptotagmins (defined as double C2-domain
              proteins with an N-terminal transmembrane region). The C2-domains of 8 syn-
              aptotagmins (Syt1-Syt3, Syt5-Syt7, Syt9, and Syt10) bind Ca2+, whereas those of
              the other 8 synaptotagmins do not. The 8 Ca2+-binding synaptotagmins com-
              prise two classes which lack (Syt1, Syt2, Syt7, and Syt9) or contain N-terminal
              disulfide bond that covalently dimerizes the respective synaptotagmins (Syt3,
              Syt5, Syt6, and Syt10).

              The Molecular Machinery of Neurotransmitter Release281


                  When the diversity of synaptotagmins emerged (e.g., see Geppert et al.,
              1991; Li et al., 1995), it was surprising that the Syt1 knockout produced a dra-
              matic phenotype because at least some of these other synaptotagmins are co-ex-
              pressed with Syt1. However, using systematic rescue experiments we found that
              only three of the eight Ca2+-binding synaptotagmins—Syt1, Syt2 and Syt9—me-
              diate fast synaptic vesicle exocytosis (Xu et al., 2007). These synaptotagmins ex-
              hibit distinct kinetics, with Syt2 triggering release faster, and Syt9 slower than
              Syt1. Most forebrain neurons express only Syt1, accounting for the dramatic
              Syt1 knockout phenotype. Syt2 is the Ca2+-sensor of fast synapses in the brain-
              stem and the neuromuscular junction (Pang et al., 2006b; Sun et al., 2007; Figs.
              8A and 8B), while Syt9 is primarily present in the limbic system (Xu et al., 2007).
              Thus, the kinetic properties of Syt1, Syt2, and Syt9 correspond to the functional
              needs of the synapses containing them.
                  In the initial Syt1 KO studies (Geppert et al., 1994), we observed that al-
              though fast release was ablated in Syt1-deficient synapses, a slower form of Ca2+-
              triggered release remained (Fig. 6). We thus sought to biophysically define the



                D. The R233Q-mutation decreases the apparent Ca2+-affinity of neurotransmitter
              release approximately 2-fold similar to its effect on the apparent Ca2+-affinity of phos-
              pholipid binding (see A), which accounts for the decrease in release probability in C.
              Data show normalized amplitudes of synaptic responses as a function of extracellular
              Ca2+-concentration.
                 E. Another single amino-acid substitution in the Syt1 C2A-domain (D232N) has a
              distinct effect on the Ca2+-binding properties of Syt1: it increases Ca2+-dependent bind-
              ing of Syt1 to SNARE complexes. Data show measurements of Ca2+-dependent binding
               of wild-type and D232N-mutant endogenous Syt1 to SNARE complexes in brain homog-
               enates from knock-in mice solubilized with Triton X-100. SNARE complexes were im-
               munoprecipated at the indicated concentrations of free Ca2+, and immunoprecipiates
              were analyzed by quantitative immunoblotting for Syt1 (top graph), Munc18-1, and and
              complexins (bottom graphs). Note that Munc18-1 and complexin constitutively co-im-
              munoprecipitate with SNARE complexes whereas the co-IP of Syt1 is dramatically en-
              hanced at increasing Ca2+-concentrations.
                 F & G. Direct comparisons of the effects of D232N- and R233Q-knock-in muta-
              tions in Syt1 demonstrate that these two mutations that have opposite effects on the Ca2+-
               binding properties of Syt1 produce opposite shifts in the apparent Ca2+-affinity of release.

              contribution of the ‘fast’ synaptotagmin-dependent form of release, and to de-
              scribe the properties of the slower remaining form. To do so, we used the calyx-
              of-Held synapse as a model system because it allows simultaneous patching of
              pre- and postsynaptic compartments, providing an unparalleled resolution of

              rotransmitter release; only a slower form of release remained (Fig. 8B). In the

              during high-frequency stimulus trains, different from what we observed in Syt1

              leased by flash photolysis. The amount of release was measured postsynaptically by mon-
              itoring the EPSC and then calculating the number of vesicles released at a given time
              (release rate). Simultaneously, the presynaptic Ca2+-concentration was measured by mi-

              ity at high Ca2+-concentrations (~5 Ca2+-ions). KO of Syt2 selectively ablates the high
              Ca2+-cooperativity release phase, decreasing the release rates at physiological Ca2+-con-
              centrations nearly 100-fold without significantly affecting Ca2+-triggered release at low
              Ca2+-concentrations. Data show summary graph of EPSC peak release rates as a function

        A & B. In cultured hippocampal neurons, suppression of Syt7 expression by knock-
      down (KD) has no major effect on neurotransmitter release evoked by a high-frequency
      stimulus train in wild-type synapses (A). However, suppressing Syt7 expression in Syt1-
      deficient neurons (Syt1 KO) impairs most of the slow and facilitating Ca2+-triggered re-
      lease that remains after the Syt1 KO (B). Data show representative traces of IPSCs evoked
      by a 10 Hz stimulus train obtained in control neurons and neurons expressing four dif-
      ferent Syt7 shRNAs to assure reproducibility. Note that in hippocampal neurons, the
      high-frequency stimulus train induces in Syt1 KO neurons a strongly facilitating form of
      asynchronous release, such that the amount of total release during the train is similar in
      Syt1 KO and wild-type neurons. By contrast, in Syt2 KO calyx synapses no such facilita-
      tion of the residual release is observed (see Fig. 8B).
        C & D. In acute slices, suppression of Syt7 expression by itself also has no significant ef-
      fect on release, but here again suppression of Syt1 expression ablates only the initial fast phase
      of release but retains a strongly facilitating asynchronous form of release that is severely

              (Sun et al., 2007).
                  We then analyzed the Ca2+-dependence of neurotransmitter release in ca-
              lyx synapses from wild-type and littermate Syt2 KO mice using flash-photolysis
              of caged-Ca2+. We performed simultaneous measurements of the postsynaptic
              response (which allows precise calculations of synaptic vesicle exocytosis) and
              of presynaptic Ca2+-levels by microfluorometry, an approach that had been pio-
              neered by the Sackmann, Schneggenburger, and Neher laboratories (Bollmann
              et al., 2000; Schneggenburger and Neher, 2000). We found that as described
              previously (Bollmann and Sakmann, 2000), release triggered by physiological
              Ca2+-concentrations exhibited an apparent Ca2+-cooperativity of 5, similar to
              the number of Ca2+-ions bound to synaptotagmins (Figs. 8C and 8D). However,
              the small amount of remaining Ca2+-triggered release in Syt2 KO calyx synapses
              exhibited an apparent Ca2+-cooperativity of only 2, suggesting that this release
              was mediated by a different Ca2+-sensor that at least in the calyx of Held synapse
              has properties distinct from those of Syt1, Syt2, and Syt9 (Sun et al., 2007).

              Which Ca2+-sensor induces the remaining release in Syt1 and Syt2 KO syn-
              apses, and could this release be mediated by one of the other 5 Ca2+-binding
              synaptotagmins? The remaining release in Syt1 KO neurons exhibits distinct,
              synapse-dependent properties. Whereas in Syt2-deficient calyx-of-Held syn-
              apses the remaining release remains small and constant even at high stimula-
              tion frequencies (Fig. 8B), in Syt1-deficient hippocampal and cortical synapses
              the remaining ‘asynchronous’ release is massively facilitating at high stimula-
              tion frequencies (Fig. 9A). As a result, in the latter synapses the total amount of
              Ca2+-triggered release induced by high-frequency stimulus trains is similar in
              wild-type and Syt1-deficient synapses, even though the initial rate of fast release
              differs more than 10-fold (Maximov and Südhof, 2005; Xu et al., 2012).

          To define the Ca2+-sensor for the remaining release in Syt1-deficient hippo-
      campal neurons, we focused on Syt7. We had found earlier that Syt7, similarly
      to Syt1, functions as a Ca2+-sensor for exocytosis in chromaffin and other neu-
      roendocrine and endocrine cells (Sugita et al., 2001; Gustavsson et al., 2008 and
      2009; Schonn et al., 2009), and Paul Brehm had observed a role for Syt7 in re-
      lease at the neuromuscular junction (Wen et al., 2010). We found that although
      Syt7 loss-of-function did not produce a major change in neurotransmitter re-
      lease in Syt1-containing wild-type neurons (Maximov et al., 2008), it impaired
      most of the remaining slow Ca2+-triggered release in Syt1 knockout neurons
      (Bacaj et al., 2013; Fig. 9). The Syt7 loss-of-function phenotype in Syt1-deficient
      neurons could be rescued only by Syt7 containing functional Ca2+-binding sites,
      suggesting that Syt7 functions as a Ca2+-sensor. Different from Syt1 in which
      the C2B-domain Ca2+-binding sites were more important than the C2A-domain
      Ca2+-binding sites, blocking the Syt7 C2B-domain Ca2+-binding sites of Syt7
      had no effect on rescue. However, blocking the Syt7 C2A-domain Ca2+-binding
      sites abolished its rescue activity (Bacaj et al., 2013). This result indicates that the
      mechanisms of action of Syt1 and Syt7 partly differ from each other.
          Viewed together, these observations suggest that Syt7—like the other syn-
      aptotagmins of its class (Syt1, Syt2, and Syt9)—functions as a Ca2+-sensor for
      exocytosis, but exhibits a slower kinetics than Syt1, Syt2, and Syt9. The relatively
      slow action of Syt7 normally occludes its function in many wild-type synapses
      in which the faster Syt1 or Syt2 probably outcompetes the slower Syt7. Although
      the function of Syt7 was not immediately apparent at most normal synapses (Fig.
      9), paired recordings showed that Syt7 does contribute physiologically to release
      during stimulus trains even in the presence of Syt1 (Bacaj et al., 2013). There-
      fore four synaptotagmins (Syt1, Syt2, Syt7, and Syt9) together account for nearly
      all neurotransmitter release at a synapse. The different speed of action of Syt1
      and Syt7 may be related to their localizations because Syt7 has been consistently
      found to be absent from synaptic vesicles (Sugita et al., 2002; Maximov et al.,
      2008), even though it is present on endocrine granules, suggesting that it is slow
      because it is not as close to the site of Ca2+-triggered fusion as Syt1.


      Complexins support synaptotagmin-dependent Ca2+-triggering of fusion
      We identified complexins as small proteins bound to SNARE complexes but not
      to individual SNARE proteins (McMahon et al., 1995; also later independently
      identified by Ishizuka et al., 1995). The crystal structure of complexin bound to
      the SNARE complex, obtained in collaboration with Josep Rizo, revealed that
      complexin contains a central α-helix that nestles in an antiparallel orientation

              into the groove formed by the Syntaxin-1 and Synaptobrevin-2 SNARE motifs
              (Chen et al., 2002). The central α-helix of complexin is N-terminally preceded
              by an accessory α-helix and a short unstructured sequence, and C-terminally
              followed by a longer unstructured sequence. Analysis of complexin-deficient
              neurons showed that complexin represents a co-factor for synaptotagmin that
              functions physiologically both as a clamp and as an activator of Ca2+-triggered
              fusion (Reim et al., 2001; Tang et al., 2006; Huntwork and Littleton, 2007; Maxi-
              mov et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2010). Complexin-deficient neurons exhibited a
              milder phenocopy of Syt1-deficient neurons, with a partial suppression of fast
              synchronous exocytosis and an increase in spontaneous exocytosis, suggesting
              that complexins and synaptotagmins are functionally interdependent.
                  Some confusion developed regarding complexin function because in vitro
              fusion assays suggested that complexins act only as a clamp of fusion (Giraudo
              et al., 2006), whereas in analyses of synaptic transmission in autapses (in which
              isolated neurons form synapses with themselves for want of a better partner),
              complexins acted only as an activator of Ca2+-triggered fusion (Reim et al.,
              2001). Subsequent studies in cultures of dissociated neurons readily uncovered
              both complexin activities in that the loss-of-function of complexin produced a
              large increase in spontaneous ‘mini’ release (interpreted as unclamping) and a
              major impairment in evoked release (interpreted as a lack of activation; Fig. 10

           How does a small molecule like complexin, composed of only ~130 resi-
      dues, act to activate and clamp synaptic vesicles for synaptotagmin action? The
      central complexin α-helix that is bound to the SNARE complex is essential for
      all complexin function (Fig. 10; Maximov et al., 2009). The accessory α-helix
      is required only for the clamping but not the activating function of complexin,
      demonstrating that clamping is not a prerequisite for the activation function of
      complexin (Yang et al., 2010). The flexible N-terminal sequence of complexin,
      conversely, mediates only the activating but not the clamping function of com-
      plexin (Xue et al., 2007; Maximov et al., 2009). Recent results indicate that the
      activating function of complexin is unexpectedly complex (no pun intended) in
      that complexin also contributes to the priming of synaptic vesicles, but that for
      this facet of its activating function the C-terminal sequence is required (Yang et
      al., 2010; Kaeser-Woo et al., 2012).
           Based on these studies, our current model posits that complexin binding to
      SNAREs activates the SNARE/SM protein complex, and that at least part of com-
      plexin competes with synaptotagmin for SNARE-complex binding and clamps
      the complex to prevent its complete assembly (Tang et al., 2006). Ca2+-activated
      synaptotagmin displaces this part of complexin, thereby enabling fusion-pore
      opening (Fig. 11). However, it is likely that the clamping function of complexin
      is relatively less important than its activation function. Even though a 10-fold
      increase in the rate of spontaneous mini release induced by loss of complexin
      function is significant, it is very small on a per synapse basis. If one considers
      that each neuron receives thousands of synaptic inputs, the increased mini rate
      still translates into only one release event or less per synapse and per minute
      (Yang et al., 2013). Moreover, some complexin isoforms that are generally ex-
      pressed at low levels (complexin-3 and -4) do not exhibit a clamping function
      (Kaeser-Woo et al., 2012), and the function of complexin in Ca2+-triggered exo-
      cytosis of IGF-1 containing vesicles (see below) does not involve clamping (Cao
      et al., 2013). Thus, it is likely that complexin primarily functions as an activator
      of exocytosis, and that its clamping function is either an epiphenomenon, or a
      more minor fine-tuning activity in synaptic transmission.

                  Sketching the atomic structures of SNARE proteins, complexin and synap-
              totagmin into the context of a docked and primed synaptic vesicle in an in-
              scale drawing reveals a crowded space in which all partners are placed into
              close proximity, allowing for rapid interactions (Fig. 11A). When we consider
              how sequential interactions of SNARE and SM proteins with complexin and
              synaptotagmin may mediate Ca2+-triggered fusion, the most plausible model is
              that complexin and synaptotagmin act on top of the two sequential major con-
              formational changes involved in SNARE/SM protein complex assembly (Fig.
              11B; see also Fig. 4). Specifically, after docked and tethered vesicles are primed
              for fusion by opening up the closed conformation of Syntaxin-1 and by partial
              trans-SNARE-complex assembly (Priming I, Fig. 11B), complexin binds to the
              partially assembled trans-SNARE complex to ‘superprime’ it and to energize the
              vesicles for Ca2+-triggered fusion (Priming II). Synaptotagmins probably also
              constitutively bind to assembling SNARE complexes independent of Ca2+, and
              the complexin- and synaptotagmin-binding may contribute to ‘freeze’ the partly
              assembled SNARE complex and thus ‘clamp’ it. Ca2+ then triggers fusion-pore
              opening by binding to synaptotagmin, which in turn binds to phospholipids
              and changes its interaction with the trans-SNARE complex to partly displace
              complexin. It is likely that synaptotagmin and complexin constitutively interact
              with the SNARE/SM protein complex in a Ca2+-independent manner to form a
              single prefusion complex, and that Ca2+ does not cause an all-or-none binding
              of synaptotagmin to the SNARE complex as it does for binding of synaptotag-
              min to phospholipids, but instead causes a rearrangement of the prefusion com-
              plex (e.g., see Shin et al., 2003).
                  The simplest mechanism by which Ca2+-binding to synaptotagmin could
              open the fusion pore would be by pulling on the SNARE/SM protein complex,
              a pulling action that could be induced by Ca2+-triggered binding of synaptotag-
              min to phospholipids. After fusion-pore opening, the pore expands, and NSF
              and SNAPs are recruited to the assembled cis-SNARE complex. NSF then dis-
              sociates the cis-SNARE complex, the Munc18-1/SNARE complex assembly is
              transformed into the heteromeric Munc18-1/Syntaxin-1 complex, and synaptic
              vesicles recycle via one of several forms of endocytosis (see Fig. 1).

      relative to the synaptic vesicle, illustrating the space constraints of the collaboration be-
      tween Syt1 and the SNARE complex/complexin assembly. Munc18-1 is also bound to the
      SNARE complex at the same time (see Figs. 3D and 4) but is not shown since no structure
      of Munc18-1 bound to the SNARE complex is available. The direction of the force pro-

              The Molecular Machinery of Neurotransmitter Release291


              dimers? Recent studies revealed that one of these synaptotagmins, Syt10, also
              acts as a Ca2+-sensor in exocytosis, but in a form of exocytosis that differs from
              synaptic vesicle and neuroendocrine granule exocytosis. Specifically, we found
              that Syt10 functions in olfactory neurons as a Ca2+-sensor for specialized vesicles
              containing IGF-1 (Cao et al., 2011). These vesicles differ from neuropeptide-
              containing vesicles present in the same neurons (which are more like neuroen-
              docrine granules and contain Syt1; Cao et al., 2013). Among others, these exper-
              iments demonstrated that even in a single neuron, different synaptotagmins act
              as Ca2+-sensors for distinct Ca2+-triggered fusion reactions (Fig. 12). Moreover,
              these observations indicated that Ca2+-triggered exocytosis generally depends
              on synaptotagmin Ca2+-sensors, and that different synaptotagmins contribute
              to the specificity and differential properties of distinct exocytosis pathways.
                  Interestingly, complexin not only supports synaptotagmins acting in neu-
              rotransmitter release, but also Syt10-dependent IGF1 secretion, despite the dif-
              ferent covalent structures of Syt1 and Syt10 (Cao et al., 2013). Thus, complexin
              likely is a general co-factor for all synaptotagmins in regulated exocytosis. This
              hypothesis is supported by the fact that complexin is ubiquitously present in all
              cells (McMahon et al., 1995), and is also central for the postsynaptic insertion
              of AMPA-type glutamate receptors during LTP (Ahmad et al., 2012), suggesting
              that complexins are general cofactors for regulated exocytosis.


                
                   B. Schematic diagram of the action of synaptotagmins and complexins in the
              SNARE/SM protein cycle. The SNARE/SM protein cycle is composed of the assembly of
              the SNARE proteins Synaptobrevin/VAMP, SNAP-25, and Syntaxin-1 into complexes
              whose full formation forces fusion-pore opening; the SM protein Munc18-1 remains as-
              sociated with Syntaxin-1 throughout the cycle and is essential for fusion-pore opening.
              After fusion, the chaperone ATPase NSF and its SNAP adaptors catalyze SNARE-com-
              plex dissociation. Complexin binds to partially assemble SNARE complexes during
              priming, and serves as an essential adaptor that enables synaptotagmin to act as a Ca2+-
              sensor in triggering fusion-pore opening (bottom limb of the cycle). Note that synapto-
              tagmin likely constitutively interacts with the SNARE/SM protein complex in a Ca2+-in-
              dependent manner to form a single prefusion complex prior to Ca2+-triggering of
              exocytosis, and that Ca2+ does not cause an all-or-none binding of synaptotagmin to the
              SNARE complex as it does for binding of synaptotagmin to phospholipids, but instead
              causes a rearrangement of the prefusion complex. However, this is not shown in the dia-
              gram due to difficulties of representing these multifarious three-dimensional interac-
              tions in a two-dimensional format. Both synaptotagmins and complexins additionally
              clamp spontaneous release, probably via their Ca2+-independent constitutive binding to
              partly assembled SNARE complexes. Three vesicular synaptotagmins act as Ca2+-sensors
              for fast exocytosis (Syt1, Syt2, and Syt9); in addition, Syt7 that is not present on synaptic
              vesicles but probably localizes to the presynaptic plasma membrane (Sugita et al., 2001)
              mediates slower forms of Ca2+-triggered exocytosis (Syt7 is only shown in the top over-
              view for simplicity). Drawing was modified from Südhof (2013).

      larger than LDCVs and utilize Syt10 as a Ca2+-sensor (Cao et al., 2011 and 2013). Note

      cytosis, it is absent from synaptic vesicles but present on LDCVs, and is thought that act
      more slowly in neurotransmitter release because of its different localization. Diagram

      5. ORGANIZING THE RELEASE MACHINERY AT THE ACTIVE ZONE

      In a presynaptic terminal, synaptic vesicles dock and fuse at the active zone of the
      presynaptic plasma membrane. The active zone is a specialized area that appears
      dense in electron microscopy pictures of fixed tissue and is localized precisely
      opposite postsynaptic receptor clusters (Fig. 1). The first specific active zone
      protein we identified was Munc13-1 (Brose et al., 1995). Munc 13-1 was named
      like Munc18-1 (no relation!) after a homologous gene in C. elegans (unc13) that
      is essential for coordinated worm movements but whose function was unknown
      (Brenner, 1974). Based on this homology, the ‘uncoordinated’ worm phenotype,
      and its localization to the active zone, we speculated that Munc13-1 may be
      a component of the neurotransmitter release machinery (Brose et al., 1995).

              The Molecular Machinery of Neurotransmitter Release293


              This supposition was confirmed when we analyzed knockout synapses lacking
              Munc13-1, which exhibited a dramatic loss of synaptic vesicle priming (Augus-
              tin et al., 1999).
                  Quickly after Munc13-1, we identified a series of additional active zone pro-
              teins such as CASK (Hata et al., 1996), RIMs (for Rab3-interacting molecules;
              Wang et al., 1997), RIM-BPs (Wang et al., 2000), and ELKS (Wang et al., 2002;
              see also Ohtsuka et al., 2002), while others identified additional active zone pro-
              teins such as α-liprins (Zhen and Jin, 1999), bassoon (tom Dieck et al., 1998),
              and piccolo (Wang et al., 1999; Fenster et al., 2000). Interestingly, most of these
              proteins directly or indirectly bind to each other, forming a protein network at
              the active zone (Südhof, 2012). Specifically, RIMs bind to Munc13-1, to RIM-
              BPs, to ELKS (although it is not clear whether this binding is physiologically
              important) and to α-liprins, suggesting that RIMs are the central hub of this
              network, while additional interactions connect some of the other proteins with
              each other (Wang et al., 2000 and 2003; Betz et al., 2001; Schoch et al., 2002).
              Clearly, many questions about the active zone are still unanswered, most im-
              portantly what mechanisms position the active zone precisely opposite a post-
              synaptic specialization. Nevertheless, we now have a plausible view of how the
              active zone performs its three main functions, namely the tethering (‘docking’)
              of synaptic vesicles at the plasma membrane, the priming of such vesicles for fu-
              sion, and the recruitment of Ca2+-channels next to docked and primed vesicles.


              Tethering (‘docking’) of synaptic vesicles to the active zone
              As in other membrane-trafficking processes, synaptic vesicle tethering involves
              Rab proteins, small GTPases that are distantly related to ras proteins. The cen-
              tral role of Rab proteins in membrane traffic was discovered in Novick’s studies
              on Sec4p (Salminen and Novick, 1987). Following up on Novick’s work, we ob-
              served in 1992 in collaboration with Reinhard Jahn that Rab3, the most abun-
              dant Rab protein in brain, is highly enriched on synaptic vesicles at rest but
              dissociates from the vesicles during exocytosis, suggesting a role in neurotrans-
              mitter release (von Mollard et al., 1990 and 1991). Subsequent mouse genetic
              analyses of the four different Rab3 isoforms (Rab3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D) confirmed
              that Rab3 plays a central role in neurotransmitter release (Geppert et al., 1994b;
              Schlüter et al., 2004 and 2006). Moreover, single Rab3 isoforms did perform
              essential functions on their own in that deletions of Rab3A or Rab3B caused
              major but distinct changes in short- and long-term forms of presynaptic plastic-
              ity (Geppert et al., 1994b; Schlüter et al., 2004 and 2006; Tsetsenis et al., 2011).

           In our search for a mechanism of action for Rab3s, we initially tested the
      functional role of rabphilin, the first putative Rab3-effector identified by Yo-
      shimi Takai (Shirataki et al., 1993). However, rabphilin deletions produced only
      minor changes in release, suggesting that is it not a major player (Schlüter et al.,
      1999; Deak et al., 2006).
           We then searched for additional Rab3-effector proteins, defined by the
      GTP-dependent binding to Rab3 but not other major Rabs. We identified RIMs
      (for ‘Rab3-interacting molecules’), a family of large multi-domain active zone
      proteins that are evolutionarily conserved (Wang et al., 1997 and 2000). In
      mammals, four RIM-related genes are expressed, of which only two (RIMS1
      and RIMS2) produce proteins that contain the Rab3-binding domain (Wang
      et al., 2000 and 2002). The RIMS1 and RIMS2 genes, however, include mul-
      tiple independent promoters, resulting in five principal forms (RIM1α, RIM1β,
      RIM2α, RIM2β, and RIM2γ) that are further diversified by extensive alternative
      splicing.
           Subsequent studies extending over 15 years revealed that RIMs perform
      multiple functions in the active zone which extend far beyond their role as
      Rab3-effectors. As we will see below, RIMs are critical not only for tethering/
      docking synaptic vesicles, but also for recruiting Ca2+-channels to the active
      zone, for mediating short- and long-term presynaptic plasticity, and for activat-
      ing the priming function of Munc13 proteins. As regards the tethering/dock-
      ing function of RIMs that was suggested by their active zone localization and
      Rab3-binding, this function was first validated in C. elegans, which contains
      only a single RIM gene (referred to as unc10; Koushika et al., 2001; Gracheva et
      al., 2008). However, in mice deletions of single RIM isoforms, including that of
      the predominant RIM1α, did not detectably alter vesicle docking as analyzed by
      conventional electron microscopy (Schoch et al., 2002), but double conditional
      knockouts that deleted all isoforms produced by the RIMS1 and RIMS2 genes
      exhibited a dramatic decrease in vesicle docking (Kaeser et al., 2011; Han et al.,
      2011). Based on these studies, it is plausible that synaptic vesicles are tethered
      (‘docked’) to active zones via a GTP-dependent binding of active zone RIM pro-
      teins to synaptic vesicle Rab3/27 proteins.
           It should be noted that no other proteins besides RIMs were found to be es-
      sential for synaptic vesicle docking when such docking was analyzed in electron
      micrographs of chemically fixed and traditionally stained sections. However, a
      completely different picture emerges when electron microscopy is performed
      on unfixed, rapidly frozen tissue—now, a large number of additional genes were
      found to be essential for ‘docking’. In such preparations, even the single RIM1α

              knockout exhibits a docking phenotype. However, it is implausible that so many
              proteins tether vesicles without redundancy, and these phenotypes may more
              closely reflect priming than docking. Thus, although multiple molecules can
              contribute to the stable attachment of synaptic vesicles to the active zone, only
              RIMs appear to be truly required for docking. It should also be noted that ‘dock-
              ing’ of secretory granules in chromaffin cells behaves differently from docking
              of synaptic vesicles at the active zone. For example, the Syt1 KO blocks secretory
              granule docking (de Wit et al., 2009) but not synaptic vesicle docking (Geppert
              et al., 1994). However, the Syt1 KO has only a small effect on Ca2+-triggered exo-
              cytosis in chromaffin cells in contrast to its large effect on synaptic exocytosis,
              probably because Syt1 is fully redundant with Syt7 in chromaffin exocytosis but
              not in synaptic exocytosis (Xu et al., 2007; Schonn et al., 2008). This discrepancy
              between docking and exocytosis suggests that different from synapses, docking
              may not even be essential for exocytosis in chromaffin cells.


              Priming vesicles for fusion
              Priming is thought to transfer vesicles into a readily-releasable pool (RRP) of
              vesicles that are then competent for Ca2+-triggered fusion. A large number of
              proteins have been implicated in priming. In addition to those proteins that are
              involved in fusion itself (e.g., SNARE and SM proteins) and to complexin, the
              most important priming factors are probably Munc13 and RIMs that bind to
              each other.
                  Analyses largely carried out in Nils Brose’s and Josep Rizo’s laboratories re-
              vealed that Munc13 is essential for vesicle priming, probably because it cata-
              lyzes SNARE-complex assembly via its MUN domain (Augustin et al., 1999;
              Varoqueaux et al., 2002). The purified MUN domain can facilitate the open-
              ing of ‘closed’ Syntaxin-1 for subsequent SNARE-complex assembly, providing
              a mechanism for the phenotypes observed in mutant mice (Ma et al., 2011).
              A striking observation is that Munc13 function is tightly regulated by multi-
              ple signaling pathways. Among others, neuronal Munc13 isoforms contain a
              C1-domain N-terminal to the central Ca2+-binding C2-domain. The Munc13
              C1-domain binds diacylglycerol physiologically, and is activated pharmacologi-
              cally by phorbol esters (Betz et al., 1998). Diacylglycerol binding to the Munc13
              C1-domain regulates synaptic function since mouse mutants lacking phorbol
              ester binding to Munc13-1 exhibit a dramatic impairment in priming and short-
              term plasticity (Rhee et al., 2002). The Ca2+-binding C2-domain of Munc13s is
              equally important since it also significantly contributes to short-term plasticity

      of synapses (Shin et al., 2010). Finally, Munc13s bind to calmodulin which ad-
      ditionally modulates its function (Lipstein et al., 2013).
           Deletions of RIMs also cause a major impairment in priming (Schoch et
      al., 2002; Koushika et al., 2001). The mechanism of this impairment, however,
      seems to be indirect because RIMs bind to Munc13s and activate Munc13 func-
      tion (Deng et al., 2011). Specifically, the N-terminal sequence of RIMs includes a
      zinc-finger motif that avidly binds to the N-terminal Ca2+-independent C2-do-
      main of Munc13 (Dulubova et al., 2005; Lu et al., 2006). Without such binding,
      the Munc13-1 C2-domain forms a constitutive homodimer; upon RIM zinc-
      finger binding, the homodimer is converted into a RIM-Munc13 heterodimer.
      Strikingly, we found that the priming impairment in RIM-deficient synapses
      can be at least partly suppressed by overexpression of an N-terminally trun-
      cated Munc13-1 mutant that lacks the N-terminal C2-domain and no longer
      homodimerizes, whereas overexpression of wild-type Munc13-1 has no effect
      (Deng et al., 2011). These observations portray at least one mechanism by which
      RIMs regulate the priming function of Munc13, consistent with an overall cen-
      tral function of RIMs in all active zone activities.


      Recruiting Ca2+-channels to the active zone
      In order to achieve fast synchronous neurotransmitter release that is precisely
      coupled to an action potential, the most important requirement is that Ca2+-
      channels are localized at the active zone adjacent to docked and primed synaptic
      vesicles. Only such an arrangement produces the short Ca2+-diffusion pathways
      required for the requisite speed of a synapse, and only a short Ca2+-diffusion
      path can explain how the extremely brief presynaptic Ca2+-transient triggers
      release—after all, the Ca2+-sensors for neurotransmitter release and neuroen-
      docrine exocytosis are the same, even though the latter are much slower than
      the former.
          A molecular mechanism that explains how synapses achieve the required
      arrangement of Ca2+-channels and synaptic vesicles emerged with the demon-
      stration that RIMs collaborate with their binding partners RIM-BPs to recruit
      Ca2+-channels to release sites (Kaeser et al., 2011; Fig. 13). Since RIMs are also
      the tethering agents for synaptic vesicles and contribute crucially to vesicle
      priming, RIMs are thus the central elements in the organization of the active
      zone that enable the amazing properties of neurotransmitter release. This simple
      architecture of the active zone, whereby a single protein is the central agent in
      assembling all components at one location, is at the same time parsimonious
      and effective (Fig. 14).

      Figure 14. Schematic diagram of the RIM, RIM-BP, and Munc13 protein complex that
      binds simultaneously to Rab3/27 on the synaptic vesicle and to Ca2+-channels on the plasma
      membrane, thereby mediating the tethering (‘docking’) of vesicles at release sites, the prim-
      ing of vesicles for release (arrow with dotted line), and the recruitment of Ca2+-channels
      adjacent to tethered vesicles. RIM, RIM-BP, and Munc13 are multidomain proteins that
      form a tight complex which mediates three essential functions of active zones: recruit-
      ment of Ca2+-channels to enable tight coupling of action potentials to release by localiz-
      ing Ca2+-influx next to the Ca2+-sensor synaptotagmin; docking of vesicles at the release
      site; and Munc13-dependent priming of the fusion machinery composed of the SNARE
      syntaxin, SNAP-25, synaptobrevin/VAMP, and Munc18-1. Spheres denote Ca2+-ions; of
      the domains shown, only C2-domains are specifically labeled. Other active zone proteins
      bind to the RIM/Munc13/RIM-BP complex such as α-liprins and ELKS, and contribute
      to release but are not shown. Modified from Kaeser et al. (2011) and Südhof (2012).




          We found that RIMs directly and selectively bind to Ca2+-channels expressed
      in presynaptic active zones. Similar to the identification of the role of RIMs in
      vesicle tethering/docking, however, identification of the role of RIMs in recruit-
      ing Ca2+-channels to the active zone only became possible when we deleted all
      RIM isoforms from presynaptic terminals (Kaeser et al., 2011). We found that
      deletion of RIMs causes a decrease of presynaptic Ca2+-influx, a loss of pre-
      synaptic Ca2+-channels, and a loss of the tight coupling of a presynaptic action
      potential to release (Fig. 13; Han et al., 2011; Kaeser et al., 2011 and 2012). RIMs
      perform their functions by forming a large complex with the Ca2+-channels,
      with other active zone proteins such as RIM-BPs (which in turn also bind to
      Ca2+-channels) and Munc13-1, and with synaptic vesicles. The role of RIMs and
      RIM-BPs in recruiting Ca2+-channels and docking vesicles to active zones is

              evolutionarily conserved (Liu et al., 2011; Graf et al., 2012), and represents a
              fundamental mechanism underlying synaptic transmission.


              6. PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER

              The three levels of release that we have been studying—membrane fusion, Ca2+-
              triggering of fusion, and the organization of the Ca2+-controlled fusion machin-
              ery at the active zone—form a hierarchy of interdependent processes. Like a
              Russian doll, these three levels are nestled into each other, with membrane fu-
              sion as the inner core, and the scaffolding organizing the various components
              into a single machine as the outer layer. Our work, together with that of others,
              uncovered a plausible mechanism explaining how the synaptic vesicle mem-
              brane and the plasma membrane undergo rapid fusion during neurotransmitter
              release, how such fusion is triggered by Ca2+, and how those processes are spa-
              tially organized in the presynaptic terminal, such that opening of Ca2+-channels
              by an action potential allows rapid translation of the entering Ca2+ signal into a
              fusion event.
                   Together, the neurotransmitter release machinery that we uncovered ac-
              counts for the astounding speed and precision of Ca2+-triggered release. More-
              over, the overall design of this machinery and the identification of regulatory
              domains in it suggest mechanisms to explain the dramatic short- and long-term
              plasticity of release that plays a central role in determining circuit properties.
              Nevertheless, many crucial questions remain. For example, what are the physi-
              cochemical mechanisms underlying membrane fusion, how precisely do SNARE
              and SM proteins work, what is the role of the fusion machine as outlined here in
              disorders like Parkinson’s disease, how do presynaptic terminals undergo long-
              term structural changes during plasticity, and what is the role of plasticity in
              long-term memory? Moreover, what mechanisms render various types of syn-
              apses different from each other—why do inhibitory synapses for example often
              exhibit a higher release probability than excitatory synapses, and what mecha-
              nisms confer distinct forms of plasticity onto different types of synapses? How is
              the presynaptic active zone precisely aligned with the postsynaptic density, and
              how is the size of a synapse regulated? Much remains to be done, and I hope to
              see at least some of these intriguing questions addressed in my lifetime!
