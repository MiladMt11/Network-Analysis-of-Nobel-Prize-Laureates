          Adrenergic neurotransmitter functions
                      Nobel Lecture, December 12, 1970



Chemical neurotransmission as a concept is generally attributed to Elliott1
(1904) who emphasized the similarity between the action of adrenaline and
sympathetic nerve stimulation. The experimental proof was not provided
until 1921, however, by the classical experiments of Loewi 2 and by Cannon
and Uridil3. Loewi, working on frogs, correctly concluded that the active-
principle in this case was adrenaline. However, he could hardly suspect at that
time that the adrenergic neurotransmitter in this species was an exception
rather than the rule, and it was only some 25 years later that it became clear
that the active substance which serves this function in mammals and most
other animals was the nonmethylated homologue of adrenaline (Von Euler4,5
1946, 1948). A study of extracts of adrenergic nerves, such as the spenic nerves,
and of organs supplied by such nerves, revealed certain differences be-
tween the active compound in this material and adrenaline, and with the aid of
pharmacological tools and by noting certain chemical characteristics it could
be identified as noradrenaline. This primary amine, which was synthesized by
Stolz 6 in 1904, was independently found in extracts of the suprarenal gland by
Holtz et al.7 (1944/1947).
   Systematic studies soon revealed that it was present in almost all organs and
tissues, with the notable exception of the placenta, which is nerve-free. This
suggested that its occurrence in tissues and organs depends on the presence of
nerves. Section of the adrenergic nerves to the heart and some other organs
and subsequent degeneration caused the noradrenaline content to fall to very
low values, or to disappear, which also indicated that it was normally bound
to the nerves in the organs. This concept was further supported by the finding
that on regeneration of the previously sectioned nerves to the heart the nor-
adrenaline content again rose to approximately normal values (Goodall 8).
From these observations it became apparent that the noradrenaline content of
an organ or a tissue might afford an estimate of its adrenergic nerve supply.
This contribution of physiology to anatomy was not entirely of a confirma-
tory character, since the methods available in the early fifties hardly allowed a
reliable measure of the extent of sympathetic innervation to an organ or part


        ADRENERGIC NEUROTRANSMITTER FUNCTIONS                                  471
 of an organ. By utilizing the chemical transmitter in the adrenergic nerves as
 a fluorogenic substance Falck and Hillarp subsequently discovered a way to
 visualize the individual fibres (cf. Falck and Torp9).
    While it was hardly surprising that the heart or the spleen should contain con-
 siderable amounts of noradrenaline in view of their relatively rich sympathetic
 nerve supply, it was ofinterest to note that the lungs contained only a fraction
 of this amount and the skeletal muscle still much less (Table 1). On the other
 hand we found surprisingly large amounts of noradrenaline in the vas de-
 ferens and in the vesicular gland of the bull, suggesting either chromaffin cells
 or a 5-10 times richer adrenergic nerve supply than in the heart. Some years
 later, Sjöstrand in our laboratory in collaboration with Owman in Falck’s
 laboratory showed the exceedingly rich adrenergic innervation to these or-
 gans (Owman and Sjöstrand10, 1965), apparently built for sudden and vig-
 orous contractions. This is in contrast to the testicle which almost totally lacks
 the sympathetic neurotransmitter.




It soon became necessary to find methods for differentiation of adrenaline
and noradrenaline in a mixture. This could be done in a simple and for most
purposes satisfactory way by measuring the biological activity of the purified
extracts on two test preparations with different activity quotients for the two
amines, such as the cat’s blood pressure and the hen’s rectal caecum. From the
assay results against standards the amounts of each amine could be readily cal-
culated. These studies showed that almost every organ contained, in addition
to noradrenaline, a small amount of adrenaline, which for several reasons was
assumed to occur in chromaffin cells.
  Using the same technique it was possible to demonstrate the large variations


472                        1970 U. S. VON EULER

in the relative noradrenaline and adrenaline contents in the suprarenals of dif-
ferent species, from almost no noradrenaline in the rabbit to very high pro-
portions in the whale.
   In later experiments (Folkow and Von Euler11) it was shown that hypothal-
amic stimulation caused a release of different proportions of the two amines
from the adrenal glands, depending on the site of stimulus. The presence of
specific noradrenaline and adrenaline cells in the adrenal medulla had previ-
ously been shown by Hillarp and Hökfelt12.
   At about the same time Goodall8, working in our laboratory, discovered
dopamine in extracts of the bovine suprarenal medulla and also in the heart,
where it is located to the sinus node region (Angelakos, Fuxe and Torchianai13).
The physiological importance of this amine as a specific agent in certain parts
of the basal ganglia in the C N S has since been amply demonstrated.
   After having obtained an overall picture of the distribution of the adrener-
gic neurotransmitter in the organism it appeared desirable to study its release,
particularly since its appearance in urine, observed independently by Holtz
et al.7, seemed to afford a means of following this process by measuring its se-
cretion.
   During and after an intravenous infusion of adrenaline and noradrenaline,
the proportion excreted in urine was small but relatively constant (Von Euler
and Luft14). Urinary excretion of the catecholamines was therefore measured
in a number of physiological and pathological conditions. It soon appeared
that the noradrenaline could be used as an approximate measure of adrenergic
nerve activity, whereas the adrenaline found in urine reflected the secretion
from the adrenal medulla and other adrenaline-producing chromaffin cells.
   The low excretion of noradrenaline during night hours and the immediate
rise in the morning after standing up, as well as the maintained high level
during the day suggested that the shift from horizontal to vertical position
elicited increased adrenergic activity, presumably via the blood pressure ho-
meostatic mechanisms. This was directly proven by subsequent studies (Sun-
     15
din ). Muscular work was found to evoke a high activity in the adrenergic
system, partly by the same mechanism (Von Euler and Hellner16).
  It was therefore of interest to note that in postural hypotension the nor-
adrenaline excretion was low (Luft and Von Euler17), whereas it was fre-
quently increased in hypertensive states. A special condition was represented
by catecholamine-producing tumours (phaeochromocytoma). The greatly
increased catecholamine excretion in urine in these cases became frequently
used as a method of diagnosis (Engel and Von Euler 18).

    I shall not go further into the many clinical conditions in which catechol-
 amine excretion in urine has been measured, but I will take this opportunity
 to recognize with gratitude the valuable co-operation of my clinical col-
leagues.
     Before leaving the subject of catecholamine secretion in the body I would
 like to touch briefly on their liberation during stress conditions. By utilizing
 the methods of urine catecholamine analysis, greatly furthered by the intro-
 duction of fluorimetric technique (cf. Ehrlén 19), it became evident that a
 variety of stressful situations is accompanied by increased excretion of cate-
 cholamines, which even may serve as an indication of the degree of stress to
 which an individual is exposed.
    In many stress situations, particularly the various kinds of emotional stress
connected with pain, anxiety or apprehension, the urinary excretion pattern
indicates increased adrenal medullary secretion (Bloom, Von Euler and Fran-
kenhaeuser 20) (Fig. 1). This field has been successfully extended by Franken-
haeuser and by Levi and their co-workers. During exposure to cold the main
reaction of the organism, at least in many animals, is a greatly increased secre-
tion of noradrenaline as shown in our laboratory by Leduc 21.

Analysis of noradrenaline content of various organs revealed a remarkable
constancy of these values. This finding raised the question as to how it was
stored in the nerves. A comparison of the noradrenaline content in an organ
like the spleen and in the splenic nerves indicated that the noradrenaline - as-
suming that it was solely confined to the nerves - must be accumulated some-


474                        1970 U. S. VON EULER

where in these. The approximate values of 10         noradrenaline per g nerve
and 2      noradrenaline per g tissue would otherwise mean that 20 per cent of
the spleen tissue should consist of nerves which is obviously not the case.
 Since the intrasplenic nerves did not deviate much from the extrasplenic nerves
in their noradrenaline content it was assumed that the amine was concentrated
in the nerve endings. After the pioneering work of Hillarp22 it was known that
the terminal portions of the adrenergic nerves had a beaded appearance, show-
ing a series of swellings. We assumed therefore that these varicosities, to use
the term employed by Hillarp, contained the transmitter in a high concentra-
tion. If this hypothesis was correct it appeared plausible that the transmitter
should be bound to some specific structure since it was hard to believe that it
should occur in a free form, in which case it was likely to diffuse out or be-
come inactivated.
   At this time two research groups (Hillarp et al.23, Blaschko et al.24) had in-
dependently produced evidence to show that the adrenal medullary catechol-
amines were bound to subcellular particles. This might possibly be the case
also for the adrenergic neurotransmitter. We therefore set out to study this
question, and it could be shown that after homogenization of adrenergic
nerves and various organs a small particle fraction rich in noradrenaline could
                                     25
be isolated (Von E uler and Hillarp ). In electron microscopic pictures the par-
ticles appeared as granular bodies of about 300 to 1 500 Å in diameter covered
by 70 Å membrane (Fig. 2). The identification of what we believed were the
specific storage structures for the adrenergic neurotransmitter seemed to pro-
vide new approaches to the problems of formation, storage and release of the
transmitter. At about the same time the introduction of highly labelled cate-
cholamines and the discovery of inactivation of the transmitter by methyla-
tion and later the reuptake phenomenon by Axelrod26 provided new tools
and concepts and induced a rapid progress in the field of adrenergic neuro-
transmission. This was further enhanced by important discoveries concerning
the action of some drugs on the amine stores (Brodie et al.27, Carlsson and
Hillarp 28).
   Since sympathetic ganglia as well as the nerve trunk contained the trans-
mitter we assumed that the storage granules were present - although in dif-
ferent dispersity - from the cell soma down to the terminal swellings. How
did they reach the terminals ? Our early suggestion (Von Euler29) that they
might be transported by the axoplasmic flow has received strong support by
the ingenious experiments by Dahlström and Häggendal30. The storage par-
ticles are apparently loaded with transmitter all along the axon. Synthesis is

not confined to the presumed origin in the perikaryon, however, but proceeds
at a high rate also in the axon terminals, requiring the presence of the particles
for the final formation of noradrenaline from dopamine (Stjärne and Lishaj -
k o31 ) .
    One of our early findings was that vigorous stimulation of the adrenergic
 nerves to the spleen did not appreciably lower the noradrenaline content of
 the organ in spite of considerable release (Von Euler and Hellner-Björk-
 man32). From this finding we concluded that resynthesis is not only a rapid
 process but also that it must be regulated with great precision. We did not at
 that time consider the possibility of an efficient reuptake of liberated trans-
 mitter which might explain the maintenance of the stores. However, later ex-
 periments have indicated that reuptake alone could not be the cause of the un-
 diminished stores. By administering a synthesis inhibitor, such as the boron
 hydride decaborane, we found that the vasoconstrictor effect of stimulating
 the lumbar sympathetics in the rabbit soon became greatly reduced in con-
 trast to the effect in the untreated animal, but recovered after a period of rest
 (Bygdeman and Von Euler33) (Fig. 3). Synthesis was therefore necessary for
 the maintenance of the stimulation effects.

electric stimulation of lumbar sympathetic trunk, 20/sec, for 30 sec, 2-min intervals.
        Partial recovery after prolonged interval. (Bygdeman and Von Euler33)

Inhibition of transmitter synthesis consequently would be expected to cause
depletion of the stores, as shown e.g. for decaborane. This raised the question
of possible refilling of the stores by administration of exogenous noradrenal-
ine. It proved not only possible but also occurred with remarkable ease. After
an intravenous dose of noradrenaline the storage particles rapidly regained
their normal content of transmitter (Von Euler and Lishajko34) (Fig. 4), ex-
cept in the brain, to which the entrance was prevented by the blood-brain
barrier.

The next goal was to obtain some insight in the properties of the storage
particles and how they bind and release the transmitter. Since preparation of
reasonably pure terminal storage particles proved very difficult we resorted
to nerve trunk particles which might provide some information of value.
Aided by the skill and patience of my co-worker F.Lishajko it has been pos-
sible to obtain some knowledge about their properties. As source of the par-
ticles we have used bovine splenic nerves which after homogenization and
differential centrifugation yielded a preparation largely consisting of storage
particles.
   On incubation in phosphate buffer these were found to give off their nor-
adrenaline at rates which depended on pH, temperature and the transmitter
concentration in the medium. When bound to the particles, the noradrenaline
was unaffected by oxidants like ferricyanide, indicating a complex binding by
which the oxidation-sensitive groups were blocked. At low temperature re-
lease was negligible, whereas at 37ºC the release was rapid with a half-time of
a few minutes (Von Euler and Lishajko 35) (Fig. 5). The high temperature de-
pendence suggested a metabolically regulated release from the complex bind-
ing. Support for this assumption was obtained by studying the effect of vari-
ous metabolic inhibitors which either blocked or enhanced the release.

With the aid of radioactively labelled noradrenaline it could be shown that
uptake of transmitter occurred in the particles concomitantly with the release.
This reuptake increased with increasing concentration of noradrenaline in the
medium. After previous partial emptying of the amine content in the par-
ticles, a net uptake could be demonstrated during incubation with noradren-
aline. Reuptake and net uptake were greatly enhanced by addition of adeno-
sine 5’-triphosphate which again pointed at a role of this compound since it
had been shown to be a natural component of the particles (Schümann 36).
   The uptake ability is not restricted to noradrenaline since adrenaline is taken
up to the same extent, and α-methyl noradrenaline even more. Dopamine,
on the other hand, is not specifically stored as such in the noradrenaline par-
ticles.
   A large number of drugs have been found to interfere with uptake as well
as release. These drugs belong to many various groups in the pharmacological
arsenal, such as adrenergic blocking agents, sympathomimetic amines and
psychotropic drugs, to mention a few in addition to metabolic inhibitors (Von
Euler and Lishajko37) (Fig. 6).
   The mechanisms by which the nerve impulse causes the release of the ad-
renergic transmitter into the receptor area of the effector cell are still incom-
pletely understood and it remains for further work to elucidate the processes
at the terminal axon membrane by which this is achieved, and at which stage
the storage particles come into play, a problem studied especially by Stjärne 38

in our laboratory. Our present concept may be illustrated by the following
tentative scheme (Fig. 7). The fundamental discoveries by Katz39 on the cho -
linergic neurotransmission in striated muscle may provide important clues
also for the adrenergic system, as may also deeper insight in the physico-
chemical shifts in the state of the membrane associated with the nerve impulse
(cf. Nachmansohn40) and the possible interaction with acetylcholine (Burn
and Rand41).
