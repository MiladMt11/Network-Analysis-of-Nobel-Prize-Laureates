I. INTRODUCTION
Your Majesty, fellow scientists, ladies and gentlemen: It is a great honor for
me to be here today to discuss the DNA provirus and RNA-directed DNA
synthesis, and it has been a pleasure for my family and me to be here in
Stockholm this week. The Nobel Prize is an honor not only for me but also for
all those who have been working with avian RNA tumor viruses. The Nobel
Prize is also an honor for the American people, whose tax dollars and private
contributions have supported my work.
   The genetic information in RNA is transferred to DNA during the repli-
cation of some viruses, including some that cause cancer. This transfer of
information from the messenger molecule, RNA, to the genome molecule,
DNA, apparently contradicted the “central dogma of molecular biology”, for-
mulated in the late 1950’s. This mode of information transfer was first postu-
lated and established for the replication of Rous sarcoma virus, a strongly
transforming avian C-type ribodeoxyvirus. (Ribodeoxyviruses are RNA vi-
ruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate.)
   In this lecture, I shall discuss the experiments that led to the formulation of
the DNA provirus hypothesis; the experiments that established the DNA pro-
virus hypothesis and, therefore, the existence of RNA-directed DNA synthe-
sis; some aspects of the present status of our knowledge of the mechanism of
formation of the DNA provirus; and, finally, some implications of this work
for the questions of the origin of animal viruses, how cancers may be caused
by viruses, and how the majority of cancers, which do not involve infectious
viruses, are caused.
   The majority of the ideas I shall discuss today came from experiments
with Rous sarcoma virus (RSV), the prototype RNA tumor virus. Rous sar-
coma virus was originally described by Peyton Rous in 1911. He stated, “A
transmissible sarcoma of the chicken has been under observation in this lab-
oratory for the past fourteen months, and it has assumed of late a special in-
terest because of its extreme malignancy and a tendency to wide-spread me-
tastasis. In a careful study of the growth, tests have been made to determine
whether it can be transmitted by a filtrate free of the tumor cells . . . Small
quantities of a cell-free filtrate have sufficed to transmit the growth to sus-
ceptible fowl.” (Rous, 1911) .
   Although Rous and his associates carried out many experiments with
RSV, as the virus is now called, and had many prophetic insights into its be-
havior, they and other biologists of that time did not have the scientific

concepts or the technical tools to exploit his discovery. And in about 1915 Rous
himself stopped work with RSV.
   The major scientific concepts required to understand the behavior of RSV
were that genetic information was contained in and transferred from nucleic
acids, developed especially by Avery, MacLeod and McCarthy (1944), and by
Watson and Crick (1953), as well as the concept that viral genomes could be-
come part of cell genomes, developed especially by Lwoff (1965). The major
technical tools required were those of quantitative virology and of the study
of animal viruses in cell culture, developed especially by Delbrück (Cairns,
Stent, and Watson, 1966), Enders, Robbins, and Weller (1955), and Dulbecco
(1966).
   My first contact with RSV was in 1956 when, as a graduate student at the
California Institute of Techonology, I was asked by Dr. Harry Rubin, a post-
doctoral fellow in Professor Dulbecco’s laboratory, to try and make more quan-
titative the observations of Manaker and Groupé (1956) that discrete foci
of altered chicken embryo cells were associated with Rous sarcoma virus in
tissue culture (see also Rubin, 1966; Temin, 1971c).

II. ASSAY FOR ROUS SARCOMA VIRUS
I soon found that addition of RSV to cultures of chicken embryo cells in a
sparse layer, rather than in a crowded monolayer as then used for the assay of
other animal viruses, led to the appearance of foci of transformed cells (Fig-
ure 1). The number of these foci was proportional to the concentration of
virus, and the foci resulted from altered morphology and altered control of
multiplication of the infected cells (Temin and Rubin, 1958). The foci were
cell culture analogs of tumors in chickens.
   This assay allowed RSV to be studied like other viruses, leading to the
demonstration that RSV-infected cells could produce virus and divide (Te-
min and Rubin, 1959) and to the demonstration by Crawford and Crawford
 (1961) that the genome of RSV was RNA. The assay for RSV was also a
model for the assay of other transforming viruses, such as polyoma virus, as
discussed by Dr. Dulbecco ( 1976).
   Further observation of RSV-induced foci revealed that some of the foci
contained long fusiform cells rather than the rounded cells seen in the focus
in Figure 1 (Temin, 1960). Virus produced by these fusiform foci caused the
formation of further foci of long fusiform cells, that is, the virus from these
foci was a genetic variant.
   These and other observations indicated that viral genes controlled the
morphology of transformed cells and led to the hypothesis that transformation
is the result of the action of viral genes, that is, transformation is a con-
version analogous to lysogenic conversion. This hypothesis has been amply
confirmed for RSV by the isolation of variant viruses temperature-sensitive
for transformation or defective for transformation (Martin, 1970; Vogt,
1971; Kawai and Hanafusa, 1972).
  These observations also led to the study of differences between trans-
formed and normal cells. At least two important results came from these stud-

workers of increased production by transformed cells of an activator of a se-
rum protease (Reich, 1975).

III. THE PROVIRUS HYPOTHESIS
In 1960 I studied the kinetics of mutation of the viral genes controlling cell
and focus morphology, the effects of mutation in these viral genes on the
morphology of infected cells, and the inheritance of these genes in cells infect-
ed with two different Rous sarcoma viruses (Temin, 1961). These studies
demonstrated that these viral genes mutated at a high rate, that mutation in a
viral gene present in an infected cell often led to change in the morphology
of that infected cell, that two different viruses infecting one cell were stably
inherited, and that the intracellular viral genomes were probably located at
only one or two sites in the cell genome.
   These observations led to the provirus hypothesis (Figure 2) - infection
of chicken cells by RSV leads to the formation of one or two copies of a regu-
larly inherited structure with the information for progeny virus and for cell
morphology. (Svoboda et al. (1963) from studies of RSV-infected rat cells in-
dependently postulated the existence of a provirus in RSV-infected cells.)




Figure 2. The provirus hypothesis. Virus information (P) is contained in infected cells in one
or two copies of a regularly inherited structure with the information for progeny virus and
for cell morphology.



The provirus hypothesis was a genetic hypothesis and contained no state-
ment about the molecular nature of the provirus. However, the regular inher-
itance of the provirus led me to postulate that the provirus was integrated
with the cell genome.
   The provirus hypothesis was further supported by the behavior of converted
RSV-infected chicken cells that were not producing infectious virus (Te-
min, 1962). (Analysis of similar cells by others led to the concept of defec-
tiveness of some strongly transforming RNA tumor viruses (Hanafusa, Hana-
fusa, and Rubin, 1963; Hartley and Rowe, 1966) .)

IV. THE DNA PROVIRUS HYPOTHESIS
At the time of my formulation of the provirus hypothesis in 1960, the general
rules for information transfer in living systems were being clearly established
in what was called “the central dogma of molecular biology”, that is, genetic
information is transferred from DNA to RNA to protein. RNA viruses were


                                The DNA Provirus Hypothesis                           249


an apparent exception to this “dogma”. Studies with the newly discovered
RNA bacteriophage and with animal RNA viruses, especially using the anti-
biotic actinomycin D, indicated that RNA viruses transferred their infor-
mation from RNA to RNA and from RNA to protein and that DNA was not
directly involved in the replication of these RNA viruses (Reich et al.,
1962).
   Although I was unable to reconcile the regular inheritance of the provirus
with its being RNA, I still tried in 1962, after I had arrived at the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin-Madison, to use actinomycin D to isolate the provirus of
Rous sarcoma virus, just as David Baltimore and others were using actino-
mycin to study the intermediates in the replication of other animal RNA vi-
ruses (Franklin and Baltimore, 1962).
   However, when actinomycin D was added to Rous sarcoma virus-producing
cells, it inhibited virus production (Figure 3). Control experiments dem-
onstrated that this inhibition was neither of early events in infection (as
was found by Barry, Ives, and Cruickshank (1962) with influenza virus) nor
of the ability of the treated cells to support replication of other animal RNA
viruses. These results indicated to me that the provirus was DNA.

ducing RSV were exposed to 0, 0.1       or 10 µg (γ)/ml of actinomycin D. After 8 hours, the
medium was removed, the cells were      washed, and fresh medium was added. At the indi-
cated times, the medium was harvested   and assayed for focus forming units of RSV. (Taken
from Temin, 1963.)


   I carried out further experiments that indicated that new DNA synthesis
was required for RSV infection and that new RSV-specific DNA was found in
infected chicken cells (Temin, 1964a,b; see also Bader, 1965).
   Based on the results of these experiments, I proposed the DNA provirus hy-
pothesis at a meeting in the Spring of 1964 (Temin, 1964c) - the RNA of
infecting RSV acts as a template for the synthesis of viral DNA, the provi-
rus, which acts as a template for the synthesis of progeny RSV RNA (Figure
4).

   At this meeting and for the next 6 years this hypothesis was essentially ig-
nored.
   My co-workers and I tried in 1964 and 1965 to obtain direct molecular evi-
dence for the DNA provirus by looking for RNA-directed DNA polymerase
activity in cells soon after infection, for infectious DNA in infected cells,
and for better systems of nucleic acid hybridization. These initial efforts
were unsuccessful (Temin, 1966).
   I then developed systems with better controlled cells to study RSV infec-
tion - at first, synchronized cells, and later stationary cells (Temin, 1967a,
1968a). Experiments with these cells indicated that a normal replicative cell
cycle was needed for initiation of RSV production.
   With this knowledge, I performed experiments that demonstrated more
clearly a requirement for new non-S phase DNA synthesis for RSV infection
 (Temin, 1968b; see also Murray and Temin, 1970), and I demonstrated that
this new DNA synthesis was virus-specific (Temin, 1970a). Finally, using
infection of stationary cells, we demonstrated that the newly synthesized viral
DNA could be labeled with 5-bromodeoxyuridine and inactivated by light
(Figure 5) (Boettiger and Temin, 1970). However, our attempts at this time

multiplicities of infection (0.15 or 3.0 focus forming units per cell), incubated in medium
containing 5-bromodeoxyuridine, exposed to light, and plated on rat cells to determine
the number of focus forming cells surviving. (Taken from Boettiger and Temin, 1970.)

to isolate the bromodeoxyuridine-labeled viral DNA were unsuccessful (Boet-
tiger, 1972).

V. RSV VIRION DNA POLYMERASE
In 1969 Dr. Satoshi Mizutani came to my laboratory. He demonstrated that
no new protein synthesis was required for the synthesis of viral DNA during
RSV infection of stationary chicken cells (quoted in Temin, 1971a), and,
therefore, that the DNA polymerase that synthesized viral DNA existed before
the infection of the chicken cells. This work was never published completely
for, in December, 1969, we decided that the experiments indicated that RSV
virions contain a DNA polymerase, and we decided to look for the virion po-
lymerase first.
   There were precedents for virion polymerases. In 1967 Kates and McAus-
lan, and Munyon, Paoletti, and Grace had found a DNA-directed RNA po-
lymerase in poxvirus virions, and in 1968 Borsa and Graham, and Shatkin and
Sipe had found an RNA-directed RNA polymerase in virions of reovirus.
(The conclusion that RSV virions contain a DNA polymerase could have
been deduced in 1967 or 1968 from the DNA provirus hypothesis and the exis-
tence of these virion polymerases, but it was not (but see Baltimore, 1976).)
   RSV virions contain an endogenous DNA polymerase activity with the
following characteristics (Figure 6). The virion polymerase activity incor-

tractions, and the incorporation of label was measured.

porates deoxyribonucleoside monophosphates into DNA and requires all four
deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates, a divalent cation, and a detergent to dis-
rupt the virion envelope. Furthermore, the polymerase activity is inactivated
by heat, which denatures the polymerase, and by ribonuclease, which destroys
the template, and it is partially resistant to actinomycin D. (All but one of
these characteristics, actinomycin D resistance (McDonnell et al., 1970),
were presented in our original paper (Temin and Mizutani, 1970), which
was published together with the paper of Dr. Baltimore (Baltimore, 1970).)
We call this virion enzyme activity “endogenous RNA-directed DNA polym-
erase activity”.
   The avian RNA tumor virus DNA polymerases are stable and easy to solu-
bilize and study (see Temin and Baltimore, 1972). Numerous workers have
purified these enzymes, especially from avian myeloblastosis virus, and this
DNA polymerase has become a standard reagent for molecular biologists. It is
especially useful because it has no deoxyribonuclease activity, but it does have
ribonuclease H activity. (Ribonuclease H activity degrades the RNA strand
of an RNA . DNA hybrid molecule, but not single-stranded RNA.)

VI. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE DNA PROVIRUS HYPOTHESIS
Although the discovery of the RSV virion DNA polymerase immediately pro-
vided convincing evidence for the DNA provirus hypothesis, actual proof of
the existence of a DNA provirus depended upon later work involving nucleic
acid hybridization and infectious DNA experiments.
   Neiman (1972) was the first to demonstrate convincingly increased hybridi-
zation of labeled RSV RNA to DNA of infected chicken cells. We have con-
firmed his results with another avian RNA virus that replicates through a
DNA intermediate, spleen necrosis virus, which gives a clearer and cleaner
result (Figure 7). (Others have also confirmed Neiman’s results (for example

    I-labeled RNA from spleen necrosis virus (SNV) was incubated for different times with
a large excess of DNA from uninfected chicken (Ch) or Peking duck (P. Du) cells or from
spleen necrosis virus-infected chicken (Ch(SNV)) cells, and the percentage of RNA that
was ribonuclease-resistant was determined (Kang and Temin, 1974).

Varmus, Heasley, and Bishop, 1974; Shoyab, Baluda, and Evans, 1974).)
Therefore, the DNA of ribodeoxyvirus-infected cells contains new nucleotide
sequences complementary to the RNA of the infecting ribodeoxyvirus.
   To a virologist an even more satisfying proof for the existence of the DNA
provirus was the demonstration, first by Hill and Hillova (1972), of infec-
tious DNA for RSV. We, as well as others, have repeated and extended their
work, making it more quantitative (Table 1). Rous sarcoma virus-infected
cells, but not uninfected cells, contain a nucleic acid with the information
for RSV (the provirus). This information is contained in DNA as shown by
its inactivation by deoxyribonuclease, its resistance to alkali, ribonuclease,
and Pronase, and its density in equilibrium cesium chloride density gra-
dient centrifugation. A single molecule of about 6X10 6 daltons of double-
stranded DNA is sufficient to cause infection, and the efficiency of infec-
tion is similar to that of the DNA isolated from animal small DNA viruses
(Cooper and Temin, 1974).

VII. STATUS OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE MECHANISM OF FORMA-
TION OF THE DNA PROVIRUS AT THE PRESENT TIME (NOVEM-
BER, 1975)
The existence of a DNA provirus for RSV has been established. In addition,
some knowledge has been gained of the details of the molecular mechanisms
for the formation of the RSV provirus. Especially notable has been the work
of Bishop and Varmus and their colleagues at the University of California-
San Francisco Medical School (Bishop and Varmus, 1975).
   After infection of susceptible cells by RSV, the virion DNA polymerase
synthesizes a DNA copy of the viral RNA, probably using a cellular transfer
RNA molecule associated with the viral RNA as a primer for the DNA synthe-
sis. After the formation of the RNA DNA hybrid molecule, there is synthe-
sis of a second strand of DNA, perhaps after degradation of the viral RNA

by the ribonuclease H activity of the virion DNA polymearse. Double-strand-
ed closed circular viral DNA appears. Viral DNA becomes integrated with
host DNA. However, neither the mechanism for integration nor whether vi-
rion-associated enzymes (Mizutani et al., 1971) are involved in integration
is known.
   We have been studying the formation of the provirus of spleen necrosis vi-
rus (SNV), a cytopathic member of a species of avian ribodeoxyviruses dis-
tinct from the avian leukosis viruses like RSV. Some interesting contrasts, as
well as similarities, have been found.
   Instead of using only a pre-formed primer for DNA synthesis, spleen necro-
sis virus may at times synthesize an RNA primer de novo (Mizutani and Te-
min, 1975). The virions of spleen necrosis virus contain an RNA polymerase
activity as well as a DNA polymerase activity (Mizutani and Temin, 1976)
 (Figure 8). This RNA polymerase activity can initiate synthesis of new RNA
chains, and its product RNA, a small molecule, is hydrogen-bonded to viral
RNA. Thus, SNV virions contain both DNA polymerase and RNA polym-
 erase activities-the only virions so far reported to contain both of these
 enzyme activities.

(2 µg protein) of SNV were incubated in a complete system with the indicated additions,
subtractions, or pretreatments, and the incorporation of label was measured. (Taken from
Mizutani and Temin, 1976.)

   We have also studied the kinetics of formation of infectious SNV DNA
 (Fritsch and Temin, 1976) (F igure 9). After infection of chicken cells by
SNV, infectious viral DNA appeared in an unintegrated form, found in the
supernatant of a Hirt extract (Hirt, 1967), shortly before it appeared in an
integrated form, found in the pellet of a Hirt extract. Surprisingly there were
large further increases in the amounts of both unintegrated and integrated vi-
ral DNAs, and some unintegrated viral DNA persisted for over a week after
infection. In contrast to these results with dividing cells, little infectious vi-

and pellet fractions were assayed for infectivity. (Taken from Fritsch and Temin, 1976.)



ral DNA was formed in stationary cells exposed to SNV. This result indicates
that a normal replicative cell cycle is required for formation of infectious vi-
ral DNA (also see Humphries and Temin, 1974).
   The forms of unintegrated infectious viral DNA were analyzed by agarose
gel electrophoresis (Figure 10). Three forms were found, reminiscent of the
three forms of DNA in papovavirus virions (see Tooze, 1973). The majority
of the infectious viral DNA was in linear molecules, but there were minor
components of closed circular and nicked infectious SNV DNA.
   Thus, the early events in ribodeoxyvirus infection are complex, and much
remains to be learned before we can describe the formation of the provirus in
molecular detail.

assayed for infectivity. (Taken from Fritsch and Temin, 1976.)

VIII. ORIGIN OF RIBODEOXYVIRUSES
Avian RNA tumor viruses undergo a great amount of genetic variation (see
Temin, 1971b; 1974a). This variation is the result of both mutation and re-
combination. Recombination takes place not only between viruses, but also
between viruses and cells.
   The recombination between viruses and cells does not appear to be ran-
dom, but is primarily with specific cellular genes. These genes are called en-
dogenous ribodeoxyvirus-related genes and are, of course, part of the normal
cellular DNA.
   Endogenous avian leukosis virus-related genes were first recognized about
10 years ago by the presence and Mendelian inheritance of a Rous sarcoma
virus virion antigen in some uninfected chicken cells (Dougherty and DiStef-
ano, 1966; Payne and Chubb, 1968). Later an avian leukosis virus virion
envelope protein was found in some uninfected chicken cells, and, finally,
nucleotide sequences of avian leukosis virus RNA were found in the DNA of
all uninfected chicken cells (see Tooze, 1973; Temin, 1974a). (Similar re-
sults have been found with mammalian leukemia viruses and cells.)
   Study of the phylogenetic distribution of the endogenous avian leukosis
virus-related nucleotide sequences revealed (Table 2) a relationship between
the amount of these sequences in cell DNA from a particular species of bird
and the closeness of the relationship of that species to chickens; for example,
more avian leukosis virus nucleotide sequences were found in pheasant DNA
than in duck DNA (Kang and Temin, 1974; see also Benveniste and To-
daro, 1974).




   This distribution is consistent with an hypothesis (the protovirus hypothe-
sis) I originally proposed in 1970 to explain the origin of ribodeoxyviruses-
ribodeoxyviruses evolved from normal cellular components (Temin, 1970b,
1974d). The normal cellular components are the endogenous ribodeoxyvirus-
related genes. These genes are involved in normal DNA to RNA to DNA in-


                                The DNA Provirus Hypothesis                         257


formation transfer. This normal process of information transfer in cells could
not exist only for its ability to give rise to viruses. It must exist as a result of its
role in normal cellular processes, for example, cell differentiation, antibody
formation, and memory (Temin, 1971d).
   One prediction of this protovirus hypothesis is that there are relationships
between ribodeoxyvirus and cell DNA polymerases. We have demonstrated
such relationships by an antibody blocking test (Mizutani and Temin,
1974). In this test, for example, the activity of an antibody against avian leu-
kosis virus DNA polymerases was blocked by incubation with chicken cell
DNA polymerases or a DNA polymerase from an otherwise unrelated avian
ribodeoxyvirus.
   Therefore, certain predictions of the protovirus hypothesis for the origin
of ribodeoxyviruses have been verified. But, obviously, much further work
must be done to establish or disprove this hypothesis.

IX. FURTHER IMPLICATIONS OF THESE STUDIES
The protovirus hypothesis can explain the origin of ribodeoxyviruses, but it
does not help in understanding the origin of other animal viruses. The pres-
ence of an RNA polymerase activity in virions of spleen necrosis virus might,
however, present a clue to the origin of the other animal enveloped RNA
viruses. As Dr. Baltimore has described, many animal enveloped RNA viruses
contain an RNA polymerase activity (Baltimore, 1976). If there were genetic
changes so that the SNV RNA polymerase activity synthesized a complete copy
of SNV RNA rather than only a small molecule, the first step in the synthesis
of a viral RNA intermediate would occur (Figure 11) Further genetic changes
leading to copying of the newly synthesized RNA strand would complete the
replication of the viral RNA. Therefore, I propose that other animal enveloped
RNA viruses evolved from ribodeoxyviruses. (The recent reports of DNA
intermediates in carrier cultures of some animal enveloped RNA viruses
 (Zhdanov, 1975; Simpson and Iinuma, 1975) could indicate a vestige of the
origin of these viruses from ribodeoxyviruses.)

X. SUMMARY
I have discussed the observations and experiments that led to the formulation
and establishment of the provirus hypothesis and the DNA provirus hypothe-
sis, which includes RNA-directed DNA synthesis for the formation of the
provirus.
   I have also discussed some aspects of the present status of our knowledge of
the mechanism of formation of the DNA provirus both to point out the work
remaining to be done and to illustrate hypotheses for the origins of ribodeoxy-
viruses and the origins of other animal enveloped RNA viruses and of animal
small DNA viruses.
   Finally, I have indicated that I do not believe that infectious viruses cause
most human cancers, but I do believe that viruses provide models of the pro-
cesses involved in the etiology of human cancer.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
I should like to acknowledge three types of support: financial, intellectual. and
personal.
   The work from my laboratory has been supported by grants from the Nation-
al Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society. I held a Research
