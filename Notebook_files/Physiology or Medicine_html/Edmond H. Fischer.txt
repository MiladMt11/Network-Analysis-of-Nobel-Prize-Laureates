In the talk he just gave, Ed Krebs retraced for you the early history of
glycogen phosphorylase and its regulation by reversible phosphorylation. In
retrospect, we were extraordinarily lucky in more ways than one to have
selected this particular enzyme to work on. First, it is extremely abundant in
skeletal muscle so that material was never limiting. In fact, when 20 years
later, we undertook its total amino acid sequence with Ko Titani and Ken
Walsh (1), we used no less than 10 grams of the crystalline enzyme to
complete the analysis. Second, the phosphorylation reaction was unambi-
guous, converting a totally inactive enzyme into a fully active species. Third,
the phosphorylation ran to completion, introducing 1 mole of phosphate
per mole of enzyme subunit. Fourth, only one site became phosphorylated;
and fifth, this site occurred within a loose N-terminal arm of the molecule
that could be easily cleaved by limited proteolysis, leaving behind the bulk of
the enzyme intact. This made it easy to separate the phosphopeptide and
determine its structure (2), though it took a long time since in the mid fifties
sequences had to be carried out by paper chromatography. We could show
that a single seryl residue had been phosphorylated (Fig. 1). Incidentally, it
took another five years to extend this sequence by 9 residues (3). The longer
structure showed the presence of several positive charges, mainly upstream,
and forming those recognition motifs whose significance became apparent
only later (4,5).

   The phosphorylation reaction was so straightforward and simple that
there was no doubt in our minds that it would represent the prototype for
such kinds of interconversions. As it turned out, it was really the exception.
Six years went by before Joe Larner identified the next enzyme to be
regulated by phosphorylation-dephosphorylation, namely, glycogen syntha-
se (6). He found that this enzyme was inactivated rather than activated by
phosphorylation (7), which made sense: closing off the backward reaction
when the forward one is turned on guarantees that there would be no
recycling of the system that would inevitably result in a useless expenditure
of energy. Joe Larner rapidly found, however, that far more than one
phosphate was introduced during the interconversion (8); about six per
mole of synthase. At that time, the idea that a single phosphorylation event
was all that was needed to alter the state of activity of an enzyme was so
ingrained that I remember that we thought: “How can this be possible? It
would imply that glycogen synthase is made up of 6 identical subunits, each
of approximately 15,000 MW.” And Joe Larner himself thought along
these lines (8,9). Of course, we know today from his work as well as that of
Phil Cohen (l0), Peter Roach (11) and others, that the enzyme is phosphory-
lated on no less than seven sites by seven different protein kinases, all totally
unknown at that time (Fig. 2). Furthermore, some of these phosphorylation
events follow a most complicated program of successive reactions that have
to proceed in a strictly prescribed order. The enzyme is inhibited by
phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase 3 (or GSK-3) but not until a
first phosphate is introduced by casein kinase 2 (CK-2). This then allows
phosphorylation of the next residue, then the next and the next after that
until all sites are finally occupied (12). Imagine the incredible difficulties we
would have encountered had we decided to study this enzyme rather than
phosphorylase.

   We did not know at that time whether the phosphorylation reaction was a
unique occurrence, a rare event restricted to the control of these two
enzymes or perhaps to carbohydrate metabolism. It was well known, for
example, that during glycogenolysis, inorganic phosphate was picked up
from the medium and used for the production of many sugar phosphate,
intermediates. Could nitrogen metabolism be regulated by another type of
covalent modification, for instance, amidation/deamidation, or lipid metab-
olism by acetylation/deacetylation ? Or had we discovered a more general
type of reaction that would apply widely to many different systems. Once
again, as luck would have it, reversible protein phosphorylation turned out
to be one of the most widespread mechanisms by which cellular processes
can be regulated (13,14).

Allosteric and Covalent Regulation
Here, a question should be raised. Ed Krebs already told you that phos-
phorylase could also be activated by AMP. Why are two mechanisms re-
quired to control the activity of an enzyme when, in both cases, they lead to
an active conformation (Fig. 3)? According to the allosteric model proposed
by Jacques Monod in the early 1960s, the enzyme responds to effectors that
are generated during the normal maintenance of the cell and reflect its
overall internal condition: whether it is proliferating or quiescent, actively
metabolizing or not, its energy balance, i.e., its ratio of AMP to ATP, etc.
According to the rule that enzymes are subjected to end-product or feed-
back inhibition, phosphorylase would be expected to be inhibited by G6P
that accumulates during its reaction, and by ATP, the ultimate end product
of carbohydrate metabolism. By the same token, it would be activated by
AMP as indeed it is. But then, many enzymes of carbohydrate metabolism
would be similarly affected by the same effectors; in proceeding down the
metabolic path, all these “doors” would become open at the same time. By
contrast, the kinase reaction is highly specific: it allows the activation of
phosphorylase only without affecting the activity of any other enzyme.

Furthermore, and this is perhaps one of the major lessons we have learned
over the last 30 years, covalent regulation responds mainly to extracellular
signals (Fig. 4). These external signals come in the form of hormones, or
neurotransmitters, growth factors and other stimuli such as drugs, light,
odorants, and perhaps touch in plants. Each will act on its own membrane
receptor and either cause the release of second messengers ( cA, cG, Ca2+,
DAG, IP3, etc.) in reactions regulated by G-proteins, or induce the intrinsic
tyrosine kinase activity of the receptors themselves. These second messen-
gers or internal signals will act on kinases or phosphatases, then on target
enzymes to finally elicit a physiological response. One finds here all the
elements of a cascade system such as those described by Ed Krebs earlier:
enzymes acting on enzymes, resulting in the enormous amplification of an
external signal. In addition, it allows the coordinate regulation of different
physiological events through the pleiotropic action of some of the enzymes
involved.

The Protein Kinases
Today, one knows several hundred protein kinases that can be classified
according to their mode of regulation or substrate specificity (15) (Table I).
Among the large family of Ser/Thr kinases, some are dependent on the
second messengers mentioned above, others on specific components of the
system that they are called upon to regulate. Such is the case of the heme-
regulated kinase that blocks the initiation of globin synthesis when heme or
iron comes to be missing, or the double-stranded RNA-dependent kinase
that is induced by interferon in cells under viral attack. There are the so-
called “independent kinases” such as the casein kinases for which no precise
mode of control has been elucidated as yet.

   Next come the mixed function kinases that can phosphorylate their
substrates on both tyrosine or serine/threonine, or that can be regulated by
tyrosine and serine/threonine phosphorylation. This is the case for the
enzymes that Ed Krebs has just described (16): MAP kinase, the MAP kinase
kinase, perhaps Raf, or the cell cycle kinases such as p34cdc2 (17). They
stand guard at crucial crossroads of signal transduction. They form the link
between a signaling system that originates at the membrane level and relies
on tyrosine phosphorylation, and the more widespread serine/threonine
phosphorylation reactions that occur downstream. Their dual control and
specificity would ensure that no accidental initiation of important cellular
events occurs at inappropriate times, just as one would need two keys to get
access to a safety deposit box.
   Finally, there is the large class of tyrosine kinases which will be discussed
later. Not listed are the less common histidine kinases such as those involved
in bacterial chemotaxis (18) and the double-headed kinase/phosphatase
that regulates bacterial isocitrate dehydrogenase (19).

such as the motifs that are involved in the binding of ATP, by which they can
be identified by searching the database (20,21). Most are regulated by
segments that block their activity, often by virtue of the fact that they
contain pseudo-substrate motifs that interact with, and shield, their catalytic
sites. These autoinhibitory domains can exist on separate subunits as in the
CAMP-dependent protein kinase (cA PK) first characterized by Ed Krebs
and Don Walsh (22), or within the same peptide chain, as in the cG PK,
where the two segments have become fused in the course of evolution.
Initially, for the cA PK, the reaction seemed simple enough: the enzyme
exists as an inactive complex between catalytic and regulatory subunits;
cAMP induces a change in conformation in the regulatory subunits result-
ing in the dissociation of the enzyme and the liberation of active catalytic
subunits. It soon became apparent, however, that the inactive complex had
a more substantial purpose, namely, to prevent the translocation of the free
catalytic subunits to other compartments of the cell, particularly the nucle-
us (23). But we know today that the regulation of this enzyme is even more
sophisticated: the regulatory subunits themselves contain structural deter-
minants that allow them to recognize and bind with high affinity to anchor-
ing proteins distributed at specific locations within the cell (24-27). More
than two dozen of these have been identified; they are particularly abun-
dant in brain and the thyroid. Conceivably, some of these could co-localize
with particular CAMP-generating receptor. This would confer a certain
degree of selectivity to the hormonal response by targeting the kinase
toward a given set of substrates (27) (Fig. 5).
   Enzyme translocation may also play an important role in the regulation of
protein kinase C first described by Nishizuka (28, 29). Depending on which
subspecies of PKC is involved, the enzyme contains up to three regulatory

domains responsible for the binding of Ca2+ , diacylglycerol and phospholi-
pids. Binding of these allosteric effectors can promote the translocation of
the enzyme to the plasma membrane where it could bind to specific anchor-
ing proteins (30). Once again, this could determine which particular signal
pathway would become affected.
   Enzyme translocation might also be one of the functions of the cyclins,
those regulatory subunits that are transiently expressed during various
phases of the cell cycle. They associate strongly with the cell cycle-depen-
dent kinases and operate particularly at the Gl/S and G2/M transitions (31-
33). But in S. cerevisiae, for instance, between 4 and 5 dozen cyclins have
been identified (34). While their multiciplicity would provide the cell with
the redundancy it needs to protect itself from accidental failures, it would
seem unlikely that their sole purpose would be to modulate the activity of
the kinases. Some of these complexes must become operative at other set
points along the cell cycle. More importantly, perhaps, they could be
essential to target the enzymes toward those elements that become opera-
tive during the profound cytoskeletal reorganizations that accompany cell
division.

Targeting of Serine/Threonine Phosphatases
Targeting subunits are particularly crucial for serine/threonine phospha-
tases because these enzymes are not geared to recognize specific sequences,
or structural determinants within their substrates. Furthermore, unlike the
kinases, they consist of just a few types of enzymes that have broad and
overlapping specificities (35-37). Thus they have to depend on regulatory
subunits or binding proteins to direct them toward particular compart-
ments of the cell where they will encounter particular substrates. That is the
case, for instance, of the type 1 phosphatase whose catalytic subunit can
bind to a glycogen-recognizing subunit, a myosin-recognizing subunit or an
inhibitory molecule called Inhibitor 2. In each of these forms, the enzyme
recognizes a particular set of substrates. Formation or dissociation of these
complexes is under hormonal control (38-41). This is the theme that I
propose to develop in the second part of this talk devoted to the role of
regulatory/localization domains in the function of tyrosine phosphatases.

Protein Tyrosine Phosphorylation
Three remarkable discoveries, 14 years ago, provided considerable excite-
ment to the field of cellular regulation by protein phosphorylation. First,
the finding by the groups of Ray Erickson (42,43) and Varmus-Bishop (44)
that the product of the src gene responsible for the oncogenicity of Rous
sarcoma virus was a protein kinase they designated as pp60src. Second, the
unexpected report by Tony Hunter and Bart Sefton that this kinase, unlike
all previously known enzymes, phosphorylated its protein substrates exclu-
sively on tyrosyl residues (45). Third, the identification of the non-trans-
forming homolog of v-src (46-50), i.e., the cellular c-src. c-src encodes a
product, (pp60c-src) which differs from its oncogenic viral counterpart by

having, among other discrete mutations, a short extension at the C-termi-
nus. This extension carries a phosphotyrosyl residue that keeps the activity
of the enzyme under control. Today we know more than a dozen tyrosine
kinases of cellular or viral origin and their number continues to grow
(15,50).
   Finally came the seminal discovery from the laboratory of Stanley Cohen
(51,52) that the receptor for epidermal growth factor was itself a tyrosine
kinase whose activity was induced by binding of the ligand. Since then, many
families of receptors with tyrosine kinase activities have been identified (53).
They all have an external, ligand-binding domain, some with cystein rich
regions, a single transmembrane segment and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase
domain (Fig. 6).
  Just as mutation of the intracellular tyrosine kinases can lead to cell
transformation, mutation of the growth factor receptors can lead to onco-
genie products. The first to be identified was the retroviral oncogene v-erb
B (54,55) generated by a truncation of the external domain of the EGF
receptor, its cellular progenitor. Many others have since been cloned and
characterized; they usually result from truncation of the molecule at one
end or the other or both, fusion with certain viral elements and other kinds
of mutations.
  With accumulating evidence implicating tyrosine phosphorylation in cell
proliferation and transformation, it is hardly surprising that many groups
would become interested in the enzymes that would catalyze the reverse
reaction, namely, the protein tyrosine phosphatases.

Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases
First evidence for phosphotyrosine dephosphorylation was obtained by
Graham Carpenter and Stanley Cohen (51,56) using A431 cell membranes
overexpressing the EGF receptor, allowing these to undergo autophos-
phorylation, and then monitoring their rate of dephosphorylation. Similar
observations were made by Bart Sefton and Tony Hunter using cells trans-
formed with a temperature sensitive mutant of Rous sarcoma virus (57).
Then followed a flurry of studies by a number of groups, including our own
six years ago (58-60). The work was originated with Nick Tonks, a superb
Post Doctoral Fellow and second generation Seattleite since he had just
obtained his PhD degree with Phil Cohen at Dundee who himself had been
in our laboratory some 20 odd years before. When we started, we also
assumed that if transformation could be brought about by overexpression
of the tyrosine kinases, or mutations that would render them constitutively
active, then overexpression of the phosphatases might block or reverse
these reactions. This assumption was too simplistic.
   Within a couple of years, a tyrosine phosphatase was isolated in homoge-
neous form from human placenta (61,62). The enzyme was totally specific
for phosphotyrosyl residues and extremely active. It had a specific activity
about one order of magnitude higher than most viral tyrosine kinases and
up to 3 orders of magnitude higher than certain receptor tyrosine kinases.
This high activity suggested that it had to be tightly regulated to allow for
those mitogenic signals that are necessary for normal cell development.

The Leukocyte Common Antigen, CD45: a Tyrosine Phosphatase
The surprise came when the amino acid sequence of the enzyme was
determined by Ken Walsh and Harry Charbonneau because it showed no
homology with any of the other protein phosphatases (63). However, a
search of the data base indicated that the enzyme was structurally related to
an abundant and already well-known surface antigen, the leukocyte com-
mon antigen also designated as CD45 (64) (Fig. 7). The leukocyte common
antigen represents a broad family of membrane-spanning molecules found
in all hematopoietic cells except mature erythrocytes (65). Their intracellu-
lar moiety is highly conserved and contains two internally homologous
domains of approximately 30 kDa each. It is those two domains that are
structurally related to the placenta phosphatase. CD45 has been implicated
in the regulation of lymphocyte function, including cytotoxicity, prolifera-
tion and differentiation and in modulating IL2 receptor expression.
   Here, I must open a parenthesis with biblical overtone. Had we obtained
the sequence of the placenta phosphatase before that of CD45 was deter-
mined, nobody would have paid much attention - and we neither - because it
would just have been the sequence of another enzyme. And it is those
working on CD45 - Ian Trowbridge, Allen Williams, Matt Thomas, etc. who,
once they got their sequence and searched it through the data base, would
have made the surprising observation that their receptor was, in fact, a
tyrosine phosphatase. What this means is that in this business, it really pays

to be last, precisely as recorded in the Gospel which states that “The last
shall be first and the first last”.
  Since then, a great variety of receptor forms have been identified (58-
60). All but one display the same double catalytic domains in their cytoplas-
mic portion but considerable diversity in their external segments (Fig. 7).
Some have structural characteristics of cell adhesion molecules such as the
leukocyte common antigen-related LARs first cloned by Saito and Schloss-
man. They are related to the N-CAM S (Neural Cell Adhesion Molecules) or
fasciclin II suggesting that they might be involved in homophilic cell-cell
interactions and perhaps modulate morphogenesis and tissue development.
Others contain fibronectin type III repeats and might be involved in cell-
cell or cell-matrix signaling. Some have very short external domains. Per-
haps the most intriguing receptors are the ones recently cloned indepen-
dently by Schlessinger (66) and Saito (67). At the end of an external
segment, one finds a large globular domain almost identical to carbonic
anhydrase except that it contains only one of the 3 histidines involved in the
binding of Zn2+ Except for CD45, no ligand has been found for any of
these structures.

transformation
Likewise, the low molecular weight, intracellular tyrosine phosphatases
display a great diversity of structures, either preceding or following a highly
conserved catalytic core. These are undoubtedly involved in the regulation

and localization of the enzymes.(Fig. 8). Some PTPs have segments homolo-
gous to cytoskeletal proteins such as band 4.1, ezrin and talin; others
contain two SH2 (src-homology 2) domains which might allow them to
interact with phosphotyrosyl residues at sites of autophosphorylation of
growth factor receptors. Tyrosine phosphatases are also found as the gene
products (YOPs) of virulence plasmids from bacteria of the genus Yersinia
(such as Y. pestis responsible for the bubonic plague).
   I would like to discuss now the role that these regulatory domains might
play in enzyme localization and function, focussing on the human T-cell
enzyme cloned by Debbie Cool (68) (Fig. 9). The regulatory domain is
entirely hydrophilic until one reaches the last 19 residues that are very
hydrophobic, reminiscent of a transmembrane domain. There is also a short
stretch of 5 basic residues that could serve as a nuclear localization signal
(67 ).
   The 11 kDa segment of the enzyme was mutated, as well as other seg-
ments of putative physiological importance. As a first step, a premature
stop codon was introduced after the catalytic domain to delete the entire C-
terminal tail. When this is done, the truncated enzyme becomes soluble
whereas the wild-type protein is particulate (69, 70), localizing with the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Expression of the C-terminal tail as a fusion
protein with β-galactosidase shows that the ‘soluble β-galactosidase now
becomes attached to the ER. Finally, if one deletes just the C-terminal
hydrophobic stretch, the enzyme localizes in the nucleus (J. Lorenzen,
unpublished data).

   e) If oncogenicity can result from an overexpression of tyrosine kinases,
could oncogenicity also result from an underexpression of certain phospha-
tases?
   All the processes Ed Krebs and I have described today have had some-
thing in common; they followed a similar pattern at the molecular level.
Under the influence of an external stimulus, the state of phosphorylation of
a protein or enzyme has been altered. This, in turn, has triggered a given
cellular response. The finding that certain oncogenic agents may operate
along the same principles may provide some clues as to the very mechanism
of cell transformation. And who knows, perhaps with a little luck, a deeper
understanding of these signaling pathways may suggest new avenues by
which oncogenicity can be brought under control.


ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

My scientific career has been profoundly marked by two long-standing
collaborations, first with the late Eric A. Stein on α-amylases, then with
Edwin G. Krebs, with whom I share this Award, on the protein phosphoryla-
tion problem. In addition to being the most valuable of colleagues, they
have been two of my closest friends. I also owe a debt of gratitude to all
those who joined the laboratory over the years, contributing their skills,
original ideas and maximum effort before moving on to pursue their own

personal academic or research careers. The list would be too long were I to
name them all; suffice to recall a few in chronological order: T. Yamamoto,
M. Appleman, J. Hedrick, S. Shaltiel, S. Hurd, P. Cohen, L. Heilmeyer, B.
Boeker, D. Crdtecos, D. Malencik, C. Heizmann, H. Blum, M. Fosset, K.
Lerch, J. Demaille, D. Brautigan, E. Villa-Moruzzi, L. Ballou, S. McNall and
N. Tonks. They have been superb collaborators; without them and all those
I haven’t been able to mention by name, including all my present collabora-
tors, nothing that has happened could have happened.
   I also owe a debt of gratitude to my wife Beverley for keeping her cool in
the midst of recurring crises, whenever I had to prepare last-minute lec-
tures or rush to the airport. Finally, a mountain of thanks goes to my
secretary, Carmen Westwater for, time after time, wading through count-
less drafts of manuscripts, and retrieving lost letters, articles or plane
tickets. But those around me exaggerate when they call my office the
“Bermuda Triangle”.
   My indebtedness goes to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive
and Kidney Diseases, NIH, for supporting my work from day one and the
Muscular Dystrophy Association for their unfailing help.
