             The ionic basis of nervous conduction

Trinity College, Cambridge, which I entered in 1932, has a long-standing
connexion with neurophysiology. As an undergraduate I found myself inter-
ested in nerve and was soon reading books or papers by Keith Lucas 1, Adrian2,
Hill 3 and Rushton4, all of whom are, or were, fellows of Trinity. I had a
particular reason for looking at Lucas's papers-because my father and Lucas
had been close friends and both lost their lives during the first world war: My
reading introduced me to Bernstein’s membrane theory5, in the form de-
veloped by Lillie6 and I thought it would be interesting to test their assump-
tions by a simple experiment. A central point in the theory is that propagation
of the impulse from one point to the next is brought about by the electric
currents which flow between resting and active regions. On this view, the
action potential is not just an electrical sign of the impulse, but is the causal
agent in propagation. Nowadays the point is accepted by everyone, but at that
time it lacked experimental proof. By a roundabout route I came across a
fairly simple way of testing the idea. The method depended on firing an
impulse at a localised block, and observing the effect of the impulse on the
excitability of the nerve just beyond the block. It turned out that the impulse
produced a transient increase in excitability over a distance of several milli-
metres, and that the increase was almost certainly caused by electric currents
spreading in a local circuit through the blocked region 7. More striking evi-
dence for the electrical theory was obtained later, for instance when it was
shown that the velocity of the nerve impulse could be changed over a wide
range by altering the electrical resistance of the external fluid*. But this is not
the place to describe these experiments and I would like to take up the story
again in 193 8, when I had the good fortune to spend a year in Gasser’s labora-
tory at the Rockefeller Institute in New York. Before leaving Cambridge, I
had found by a lucky accident that it was quite easy to isolate single nerve
fibres from the shore crab, Carcinus maenas. This opened up several inter-
esting lines and I became increasingly impressed with the advantages of work-
ing on single nerve fibres. Carcinus fibres are very robust, but they are at most
1/30 millimeter in diameter, and for many purposes this is inconveniently

 small. There was a good deal to be said for switching to the very much larger
 nerve fibres which J. Z. Young9 had discovered in the squid and which were
 then being studied by Curtis and Cole 10 in Woods Hole. Squids of the genus
 Loligo, are active creatures, one or two feet long, which can swim backwards
 at high speed by taking water into a large cavity and squirting out a jet through
 a funnel in the front of the animal. The giant nerve fibres, which may be as
 much as a millimeter in diameter, run in the body wall and supply the muscles
 that expel water from the mantle cavity. Although these fibres are unmyel-
 inated, their large size makes them conduct rapidly and this may be the tele-
 ological reason for their existence. It should be said that large nerve fibres
 conduct faster than small ones11 because the conductance per unit of the core
 increases as the square of the diameter whereas the electrical capacity of the
 surface increases only as the first power.
   You may wonder how it is that we get along without giant nerve fibres.
The answer is that vertebrates have developed myelinated axons in which the
fibre is covered with a relatively thick insulating layer over most of its length,
and the excitable membrane is exposed only at the nodes of Ranvier. In these
fibres, conduction is saltatory and the impulse skips from one node to the
next. I regret that shortage of time does not allow me to refer to this important
development with which the names of Kato, Tasaki and Takeuchi 12 are
particularly associated.
   Early in 1938, K. S. Cole asked me to spend a few weeks in his laboratory at
Woods Hole where squid are plentiful during the summer. I arrived in June
1938 and was greeted by a sensational experiment, the results of which were
plainly visible on the screen of the cathode-ray tube. Cole and Curtis’s had
developed a technique which allowed them to measure changes in the elec-
trical conductivity of the membrane during the impulse; when analysed, their
experiment proved that the membrane undergoes a large increase in conduc-
tance which has roughly the same time course as the electrical change (Fig. 1).
This was strong evidence for an increase in ionic permeability but the experi-
ment naturally did not show what ions were involved, and this aspect was not
cleared up until several years after the war. At first sight, Cole and Curtis’s re-
sults seemed to fit in with the idea that the membrane broke down during
activity, as Bernstein and Lillie had suggested. However, there was one fur-
ther point which required checking. According to Bernstein, activity con-
sisted of a momentary breakdown of the membrane, and on this view the
action potential should not exceed the resting potential. Huxley and I started
to test this point early in 1939. We measured external electrical changes from

      Carcinus fibres immersed in oil with a cathode ray tube, d. c. amplifier and
      cathode followers as the recording instrument. The resting potential was
      taken from the steady potential between an intact region and one depolarized
      by injury or by isotonic potassium chloride. To our surprise we found that the
      action potential was often much larger than the resting potential, for example
      73 mV for the action potential as against 37 mV for the resting potential. (Al-
                                                                     14
      though I was not aware of it until much later, Schaefer had previously
      reported a similar discrepancy in the sartorius and gastrocnemius muscles of
      the frog.) Our results did not give the absolute value of the membrane poten-
      tials because of the short-circuiting effect of the film of sea water which clings
      to a fibre in oil. However, there is no reason why short-circuiting should
      affect one potential more than another and the discrepancy seemed much too
      large to be explained by some small difference in the way that the two poten-
      tials were recorded. Nevertheless we were extremely suspicious of these re-
      sults with external electrodes, and before they could be published both of us
      were caught up in the war.
         Before going further with the discrepancy, it seemed important to establish
      the absolute value of the membrane potentials by recording potential differ-
      ences between an electrode inside the nerve fibre and the external solution.
      Osterhout and his colleagues had recorded internal potentials by introducing

      electrodes into the vacuoles of large plant cells, but for obvious reasons the
      comparable experiment had not been attempted with nerve. The best prep-
     aration on which to try such an experiment was the giant axon of the squid,
      and the first measurements of this kind were made during the summer of 1939
      by Curtis and Cole16 at Woods Hole, and by Huxley and myself17 at Ply-

mouth. There were minor differences in technique but the general principle
was the same. A microelectrode consisting of a long glass capillary, filled with
saline or metal, was inserted at one end of the fibre and pushed in for a dis-
tance of 10-30 mm. The fibre was damaged at the point where the capillary
entered it, but an insertion of 10-30 mm was sufficient to take the electrode
into intact nerve. During the insertion the electrode had to be kept away from
the membrane; if it scraped against the surface, the axon was damaged. How-
ever, if kept clear of the membrane, the electrode did no harm, and it has since
been shown that axons will conduct impulses for many hours after being
impaled in this way. Fig. 2A shows an electrode inside an uncleaned axon;
Fig. 2B is similar but the small nerve fibres round the giant axon have been
removed and dark ground illumination has been used.

In 1939 both the Woods Hole and Plymouth groups found that large action
potentials could be recorded between an internal electrode and the external
solution, thus providing strong evidence for the idea that the action potential
arises at the surface membrane. With this technique Huxley and I again ob-
tained the disturbing result that the action potential was much greater than the

resting potential 17. Fig. 3, which illustrates one of these experiments, shows an
action potential of 86 mV and a resting potential of 45 mV. In their 1939
experiments Curtis and Cole16 recorded the action potential with a condenser-
coupled amplifier; later measurements with a d. c. amplifier gave an average
                                             19




action potential of 108 mV and an average resting potential of 51 mV. Curtis
and Cole also showed that the resting potential could be abolished, reversibly,
by increasing the external potassium concentration until it was about the same
as that in the axoplasm; at high concentrations the membrane behaved like
a potassium electrode, as predicted by Bernstein’s theory.

The small size of most nerve or muscle fibres made it difficult to extend the
technique employed for the giant axon to other preparations. However, an-
other very convenient and powerful method was developed by Graham,
Gerard and Ling, who showed that extremely small glass capillaries could be
inserted transversely into muscle fibres without causing appreciable damage21.
In order to obtain consistent results it is desirable that the electrodes should
have an external diameter of less than 0.5 This small diameter means that
the electrodes have a high resistance and special precautions must be taken
with the recording system. Initially the electrodes were used to measure the
resting potential, but increasing the concentration of the KC1 in the electrode
to 3 M enabled the action potential to be recorded as well22. Many types of

 excitable cell have been now examined and in nearly every case it has been
 found that the action potential exceeds the resting potential, often by 40 or
 50 mV.
   Yet another method is required for myelinated nerve fibres, which do not
take kindly to impalement. A useful way of eliminating external short cir-
cuiting was introduced by Huxley and Stämpfli23 in 1950 and their method
has been refined in a very elegant way by Frankenhaeuser24. The values found
by applying these methods of amphibian nerve fibres are: action potential
 120 mV and resting potential 70 mV. Absolute values for mammalian nerve
fibres are unknown, but they are probably not very different from those
reported for frog.
   At the end of the war, the position was that several of Bernstein’s assump-
tions had been vindicated in a striking way, but that in one major respect the
classical theory had been shown to be wrong. By 1945 most neurophysiolo-
gists agreed that the action potential was propagated by electric currents, and
that it arose at the surface membrane; it was also clear that the resting potential
was at least partly due to the E. M. F. of the potassium concentration cell. On
the other hand, there was impressive evidence that in both crab and squid
fibres the action potential exceeded 17-19 the resting potential by 40-50 mV.
This was obviously incompatible with the idea that electrical activity de-
pended on a breakdown of the membrane; some process giving a reversal of
E. M. F. was required.




There were several early attempts to provide a theoreticalbasis for the rever-
sal, but most of these were speculative and not easily subject to experimental
test. A simpler explanation, now known as the sodium hypothesis, was work-
ed out with Katz and Huxley 2 5, and tested during the summer of 1947. The
hypothesis, which owed a good deal to the classical experiments of Overton26,
was based on a comparison of the ionic composition of the axoplasm of squid
nerve with that of blood or sea water. As in Bernstein’s theory, it was assumed
that the resting membrane is selectively permeable to potassium ions and that
the potential across it arises from the tendency of these ions to move outward
from the more concentrated solution inside a nerve or muscle fibre. In the
limiting case, where a membrane which is permeable only to potassium sepa-
rates axoplasm containing 400 mM K from plasma containing 20 mM K, the


 38                    1963 ALAN LLOYD HODGKIN

internal potential should be 75 mV negative to the external solution. This
value is obtained from the Nernst relation




where V K is the equilibrium potential of the potassium ion defined in the sense
internal potential minus external potential, [K]o and [K]i are potassium con-
centrations (strictly activities) inside and outside the fibre. Resting potentials
of 70 mV have been observed in undissected squid axons27; the smaller values
found in isolated axons may be explained by a leakage of sodium into the
fibre. If the permeability to sodium were 1/12 that to potassium, a potential of
about 50 mV is predicted for an isolatedaxon in sea water (350 mM K, 50 mM
Na in axoplasm, 10 mM K, 450 mM Na in sea water).
   From Bernstein’s theory it might be assumed that when the membrane
broke down, the ratio of the permeabilities to Na and K would approach that
of the aqueous mobilities of these ions, about 0.7 to 1. In that case, the action
potential could not exceed the resting potential and would in fact be less by
at least 8 mV. However, it is simple to rescue the hypothesis by assuming that
the active membrane undergoes a large and selective increase in the permeabil-
ity to sodium. In the extreme case, where the membrane is much more perme-
able to sodium than to any other ion, the potential should approach that given
by the Nernst formula, i.e.




This gives a limiting value of + 58 mV for the 10-fold concentration ratio
observed by Steinbach and Spiegelman28 and accounts satisfactorily for the
reversal of 50 mV commonly seen in intact axons.
   A simple consequence of the sodium hypothesis is that the magnitude of the
action potential should be greatly influenced by the concentration of sodium
ions in the external fluid. For the active membrane should no longer be capable
of giving a reversed E. M. F. if the concentration of sodium is equalised on the
two sides of the membrane. The first quantitative tests were made with Katz-
in the summer of 1947. They showed that the action potential, but not the
resting potential, was reduced by replacing external sodium chloride with
-choline chloride or with glucose. If all the external sodium was removed the
axon became reversibly inexcitable, in agreement with Overton’s experiment
on frog muscle. Fig. 4 illustrates one of the experiments. In the physiological

region, the overshoot varied with externalsodium concentrations in the same
manner as a sodium electrodeas.
   It was also shown that a solution containing extra sodium increased the
overshoot by about the amount predicted by eqn.2. This is a particularly
satisfactoryresult, because it seems most unlikely that an increase beyond the
normal could be brought about by an abnormal solution. Fig. 5 illustrates
one of these experiments. Later, Stämpfli29 showed that at the node of Ran-

vier an increase of about 35 mV in the overshoot is brought about by a four-
fold increase of external sodium.
   The effect of varying external sodium concentration has now been studied
on a number of excitable tissues: for example frog muscle22, myelinated
nerve30, Purkinje fibres of the heart31 and crustacean nerve32. In all these cases
the results were very similar to those in the squid axon.
   There are at least two cases where the mechanism is thought to be basically
different. These are crab muscle in which an entry ofcalcium, or other divalent
cations, provides the inward current33, and the plant cell Chara where an exit
of chloride ions from the vacuolar sap may be the primary process34.




During the period 1947-51 several investigators started to measure the effect
of stimulation on the movements of labelled sodium across the surface mem-
brane of giant axons. As often happens, work proceeded independently and


             IONIC BASIS OF NERVOUS CONDUCTION                               41
more or less simultaneously on the two sides of the Atlantic, the principal
                                35
investigators being Keynes in England and Rothenberg36, Grundfest and
Nachmansohn 37 in America. In 1949 Keynes reported that stimulation of
Sepia axons at 100/sec caused a 15-fold increase in the rate of uptake of 24Na.
There was also a substantial increase in the outflow of labelled sodium and at
first it was difficult to decide whether activity was associated with a net uptake
of sodium. Keynes and Lewis38 resolved the difficulty by measuring the so-
dium concentration in axoplasm by activation analysis, and there is now
general agreement that at 20ºC the net entry of sodium in one impulse
amounts to 3-4·10 -12 mole per square centimetre. Other experiments showed
that a similar quantity of potassium ions leave the fibre during an impulse 39. It
is perhaps easier to get an idea of what these quantities mean by saying that one
impulse is associated with an inward movement of 20 000 sodium ions through
one square micron ofsurface.
   An entry of 4·10 -12 moles of sodium per square centimetre is more than
enough to account for the action potential. From the work of Cole and his
colleagues it is known that the electrical capacity of the membrane is about one
microfarad per square centimetre 10. The quantity of charge required to change
the voltage across a one microfarad condenser by 120 mV is 1.2·10-7C; this is
equivalent to 1.2·10 -12 mole of monovalent cation which is only one- third
of the observed entry of sodium. A discrepancy in this direction is to be
expected. In addition to charging the membrane capacity during the rising
phase of the action potential, a good deal of Na exchanges with K, particu-
larly during the early part of the falling phase. From the quantitative theory
which Huxley and I developed, the size of the ionic movements can be pre-
dicted from electrical measurements. As Huxley will describe, the theoretical
quantities turn out to be in reasonable agreement with experimental values.
   The quantity of sodium which enters a myelinated axon during an impulse
is much less than in an unmyelinated fibre of comparable size 40. This is pre-
sumably because the ionic exchange is confined to the node of Ranvier and the
capacity per unit length of the axon is reduced by the thick myelin sheath.




In pursuing the evidence for the ionic theory I have departed from the strict
order of events. During the summer of 1947 Cole and Marmont 41,42 de-
veloped a technique for impaling squid axons with long metallic electrodes;


42                    1963 ALAN LLOYD HODGKIN

with the aid of electronic feedback they were then able to apply current uni-
formly to the membrane and to avoid the complications introduced by spread
of current in a cable-like structure. Cole also carried out an important type
                                          41




of experiment, again using feedback, in which the potential difference across
the membrane is made to undergo a step-like change and the experimental
variable is the current which flows through the membrane. In Cole’s experi-
ments a single internal electrode was used for recording potential and passing
current; since the current may be large, electrode polarization introduces an
error and makes it difficult to use steps longer than a millisecond. However,
the essential features of the experiment, notably the existence of a phase of
inward current over a range of depolarizations, are plainly shown in the
records, which Cole41 obtained in 1947. It was obvious that the method could
be improved by inserting two internal electrodes, one for current, the other
for voltage, and by employing a feedback amplifier to supply the current
needed to maintain a constant voltage. Cole, Marmont and I discussed this
possibility in the spring of 1948 and it was used at Plymouth the following
summer by Huxley, Katz and myself43. Further improvements were made
during the winter and in 1949 we obtained a large number of records which
were analysed in Cambridge during the next two years 44. Huxley will de-
scribe these results in more detail; here all that need be said is that by varying
the external ionic concentrations it was possible to separate the ionic current
flowing through the membrane into components carried by sodium and
potassium, and hence to determine how the ionic permeability varied with
time and with membrane potential.
   To begin with we hoped that the analysis might lead to a definite molecular
model of the membrane. However, it gradually became clear that different
mechanisms could lead to similar equations and that no real progress at the
molecular level could be made until much more was known about the chem-
istry and fine structure of the membrane. On the other hand, the equations
that we developed proved surprisingly powerful and it was possible to pre-
dict much of the electrical behaviour of the giant axon with fair accuracy.
Examples of some of the properties of the axon which are fitted by the equa-
tions are: the form, duration and amplitude of the action potential; the con-
duction velocity; impedance changes; ionic movements; and subthreshold
phenomena including oscillatory behaviour.

Experimental work on giant axons since 1952: active transport of Na and K


In the last part of this lecture I should like to mention some of the more recent
developments in the ionic theory of nervous conduction. One major prob-
lem, which has interested a number of physiologists and biochemists, is to
find out how cells use metabolic energy to move sodium and potassium ions
against concentration gradients. In excitable tissues this process is of particular
interest because it builds up the ionic concentration differences on which con-
duction of impulses depends. When a nerve fibre carries an impulse it under-
goes a rapid cycle of permeability changes which allow first sodium and then
potassium ions to move down concentration gradients. In giant axons, the
changes associated with an impulse are exceedingly Call, as can be seen from
 the fact that a 500y axon loses only one millionth of its internal potassium in a
single impulse. Large fibres can therefore conduct many impulses without
recharging their batteries by metabolism. Nevertheless, if they are to be of
any use to the animal, nerve fibres must be equipped with a mechanism for
 reversing the ionic exchanges that occur during electrical activity. The
 necessity for such a system was foreseen by Overton in 1902 when he pointed
 out that human heart muscle carried out some 2.4·109 contractions in 70 years,
 yet as far as he knew contained as much potassium and as little sodium in old
 age as in early youth . Forty years later Dean introduced the idea of a sodium
                        2 6



 pump and showed that the distribution of potassium and chloride in muscle
 might be a passive consequence of an active extrusion of sodium, but that
 active transport of potassium or chloride ions would by themselves be in-
 adequate 45. The concept was developed further by Krogh46 and Ussing47 and
 is now supported by experiments on a wide range of animal tissues.
    Giant nerve fibres provide excellent material for studying ion pumping.
  One approach is to inject radioactive sodium ions and to collect the labelled
 ions which emerge from the fibre. Such experiments show that if the fibre is
 poisoned with cyanide or dinitrophenol it stops pumping, and sodium ions
  gradually accumulate inside. The fibre remains excitable for many hours
  because sodium and potassium can still move downhill during the impulse.
  But any sodium which gets into the fibre remains there and is not extruded as
  it would be in an unpoisoned axon. The ability to extrude sodium depends on
  the presence of ATP, and with an axon in which all the ATP has been broken
  down, sodium extrusion can be restored by injecting energy-rich phosphate
  in the right form4 8. Fig. 6 illustrates one of these experiments. It shows that the
  outflow of sodium is reduced to a low value by cyanide and can be restored

by the molluscan phosphagen, arginine phosphate, but not by the vertebrate
phosphagen, creatine phosphate. This is a satisfactory result since it is known
that creatine phosphate is not handled by the enzyme which catalyses the
transfer of phosphate from arginine phosphate to ADPN.
   The molecular nature of the pumping mechanism is unknown but there is
much evidence to show that in most cells it is driven by compounds con-
taining energy-rich phosphate, such as ATP or phosphagen. Recent interest
in this field has been focussed by Skou on an ATP-splitting enzyme which is
present in the membrane and has the interesting properties of being activated
by sodium and potassium and inhibited by substances which interfere with
sodium transport50.




In conclusion I should like to mention an interesting new method which has
been developed during the last few years. Since the action potential of a nerve
fibre arises at the surface membrane it should be possible to replace the proto-

Methods for perfusing axons were worked out by Tasaki and his colleagues at
Woods Hole51 and by Baker and Shaw at Plymouth52. The technique used

nerve fibres can be squeezed out of the cut end. This has been known since
1937 but until fairly recently no one paid much attention to the electrical
properties of the thin sheath which remained after the contents of the nerve
fibre had been removed. Since extrusion involves flattening the axon with a
glass rod or roller it was natural to suppose that the membrane would be
badly damaged by such a drastic method. However in the autumn of 1960
Baker and Shaw52 recorded action potentials fromextruded sheaths which had
been refilled with isotonic solution of a potassium salt. On further investiga-
tions54 it turned out that such preparations gave action potentials of the usual
magnitude for several hours, and that these were abolished, reversibly, by
replacing K with Na in the internal solution. As can be seen from Figs. 7 and 8
the resting potential and action potential vary with the internal concentrations
of K and Na in a manner which is consistent with the external effect of these
ions.




nal solution, sea water containing 10 mM K; internal solution NaCl-KC1 solutions iso-
tonic with sea water. Note that the resting potential reaches a limiting value of about - 55
       mV at potassium concentration greater than 150 mM. From Baker et al. 54.

A point of some general interest is that although about 95% of the axoplasm
had been removed, axon membranes perfused with isotonic potassium solu-
tions were able to carry some 300 000 impulses. This reinforces the idea that
chemical reactions in the bulk of the axoplasm are not essential for conduction
of impulses and that ionic concentration gradients provide the immediate
source of energy for the action potential. Huxley will tell you more about
the way in which this is done.

From the bibliography which is far from complete) it is evident that the
development of the ionic theory has been very much a cooperative effort and
I wish to thank all those who have contributed to it. For more direct help, my
particular thanks are due to W. A. H. Rushton, K. S. Cole, H.J. Curtis, A. F.
Huxley, B. Katz and R. D. Keynes.
   I am very grateful to the Professors of Physiology, at Cambridge, Sir
Joseph Barcroft, Lord Adrian and Sir Bryan Matthews, and to the Director
and staff of the Laboratory at Plymouth. My thanks are also due to the Rocke-
feller Foundation, the Nuffield Foundation, Trinity College, Cambridge and
 the Royal Society for financial support. I should record my gratitude to
R. H. Cook for the design and construction of apparatus and for his unfailing
help.
