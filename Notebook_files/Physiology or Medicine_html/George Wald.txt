          The molecular basis of visual excitation
                        Nobel Lecture, December 12, 1967



 I have often had cause to feel that my hands are cleverer than my head. That is
 a crude way of characterizing the dialectics of experimentation. When it is
 going well, it is like a quiet conversation with Nature. One asks a question and
 gets an answer; then one asks the next question, and gets the next answer. An
 experiment is a device to make Nature speak intelligibly. After that one has
 only to listen.
    As a graduate student at Columbia University, I was introduced to vision
 by Selig Hecht in a particularly provocative way. Hecht was one of the great
 measurers of human vision, like Aubert, König and Abney before him. But he
 was not content merely to measure. He wanted to understand what lay behind
 the measurements, what was going on at the molecular level in vision.
   There a door was opened for him while still a graduate student at Harvard,
by the great Swedish physical chemist Svante Arrhenius. Hecht has told me
of the excitement with which he read Arrhenius’s new book1, Quantitative
Laws in Biological Chemistry. It offered the hope of translating accurate meas-
urements on whole organisms into the simple kinetics and thermodynamics
of chemical reactions in solution.
   In this vein Hecht applied his measurements and those of earlier workers to
constructing a general conceptual model for the photoreceptor process. A
photosensitive pigment, S, was dissociated by light into products, P + A, one
of them responsible for excitation. In turn P + A, or a variant, P + B, recom-
bined to regenerate S. In continuous light these opposed reactions achieved a
pseudo-equilibrium, a photostationary state, that underlay the steady states
of vision in constant illumination2.
   I left Hecht’s laboratory with a great desire to lay hands on the molecules
for which these were symbols. That brought me to Otto Warburg in Dahlem,
                                           3
where I found vitamin A in the retina . There were good reasons to look for
it there, as I found out later, and that is the way I wrote my paper. Dietary
night blindness, a condition already known in ancient Egypt, had been shown
in Denmark during World War I to be a symptom of vitamin A deficiency4;
and Fridericia and Holm5 and Tansley6 had shown that vitamin A deficient


              MOLECULAR BASIS OF VISUAL EXCITATION                                 293
   rats synthesize less rhodopsin than normal animals. But vitamins were still
   deeply mysterious, and at that time one hardly expected them to participate
   directly in physiological processes. I think this was the first instance of so
   direct a connection, though Warburg and Christian were already analyzing
   the first yellow enzymes7, and shortly their chromophore riboflavin8 would
   prove to be vitamin B2.
     After that, things happened quickly. I went to Karrer in Zurich, who with
  Morf and Schopp had the year before established the structure9 of vitamin A,
  to complete its identification in the retina. Then I went on to Meyerhof in
  Heidelberg, to do something else; but with a shipment of frogs that had gone
  astray, I found retinene, an intermediate in the bleaching of rhodopsin, on the
  way 10 to vitamin A. Years later Ball, Goodwin and Morton in Liverpool
  showed that retinene is vitamine A aldehyde II. At Morton’s suggestion the
  names of all these molecules have recently been changed, in honor of the
  retina, still the only place where their function is understood. Vitamin A is
  now retinol, retinene is retinal (Fig. 1); there is also retinoic acid.
     That early Wanderjahr in the laboratories of three Nobel laureates-War-
 burg, Karrer, Meyerhof - opened a new life for me: the life with molecules.
 From then on it has been a constant going back and forth between organisms
 and their molecules - extracting the molecules from the organisms, to find
 what they are and how they behave, returning to the organisms to find in
 their responses and behavior the greatly amplified expression of those mole-
 cules.
    A basic characteristic of the scientific enterprise is its continuity. It is an or-
ganic growth, to which each worker in his time brings what he can; like
Chartres or Hagia Sofia, to which over the centuries a buttress was added here,
a tower there. Hecht’s work was most intimately bound up with that of men
who had worked generations before him: Hermann Aubert in Breslau12,
Arthur König in Berlin’s, Abney in England14. Now I entered into such a re-
lationship with Willy Kühne of Heidelberg. Kühne had taken up rhodopsin
immediately upon Franz Boll’s discovery of it in 1877 15, and in two extra-
ordinary years he and his co-worker Ewald learned almost everything known
about it for another half-century . It was largely on the basis of Kühne’s ob-
                                      16



servations that I could conclude that rhodopsin is a protein, a carotenoid-pro-
tein such as Kuhn and Lederer had just shown the blue pigment of lobster
shells to be17, that in the retina, under the influence of light, engages in a cycle
of reactions with retinal and vitamin A10,18.
    I owe other such debts to past workers in far-off places. Köttgen and Abels-

  dorff had found the visual pigment from eight species of fish to have difference
  spectra displaced considerably toward the red from the rhodopsins of frogs,
  owls and mammals19. Trying to check this observation at Woods Hole, I was
  surprised to find the same rhodopsin-retinal-vitamin A cycle in fishes there as
  in frogs20. It turned out that Köttgen and Abelsdorff had worked entirely with
 freshwater fishes. On turning to them, I found another visual pigment, por-
  phyropsin, engaged in a cycle parallel with that of rhodopsin, but in which
  new carotenoids replace retinal and vitamin A 2 1. On the basis of these obser-
  vations, it was suggested that the substance that replaces vitamin A in the
  visual system of freshwater fishes be called vitamin A 222. In what follows I
  shall call it retinol2, and its aldehyde retinal2. These substances differ from
  their analogues in the rhodopsin cycle only in possessing an added double
  bond in the ring (Fig.1)23.

Shortly afterward it emerged that such familiar euryhaline and hence po-
tentially migratory fishes as salmon, trout and the "freshwater" eel possess
mixtures of rhodopsin and porphyropsin, in which the system commonly as-
sociated with the spawning environment tends to predominate. Other such
euryhaline fishes as the white perch and alewife possess this system virtually

alone24. The bullfrog has porphyropsin as a tadpole, and changes to rhodop-
sin at metamorphosis25. The sea lamprey, Petrormyzon marinus, possesses
mainly rhodopsin on its downstream migration to the sea, but on going up-
stream as a sexually mature adult to spawn has changed to porphyropsin26.
Denton and Warren having shown that the rhodopsins of deep sea fishes have
spectra displaced to shorter wavelengths than those of surface forms (i.e., to
&naX about 480 mp) , it developed that the European eel at sexual maturity,
                     27



preparatory to migrating to the Sargasso Sea to spawn, transfers from its pre-
vious mixture of rhodopsin and porphyropsin to deep-sea rhodopsin 28. The
chemical pattern of visual systems maintains close relationships with the evo-
lution, development and way of life of these and other animals29. I am glad to
say that the pursuit of molecules has not taken me out of biology, but led me
more deeply into it.

  Let me now leave this history and say where it has brought us.
  All the visual pigments we know are built upon a common plan. All of
them consist of retinal bound as chromophore to a type of protein, called an
opsin, found in the outer segments of vertebrate rods and cones and the anal-
ogous rhabdomeres of invertebrate eyes. In vertebrates, the two retinals, 1
and 2, join with two great families of opsins, those of the rods and those of the
cones, to form the four major pigments of vertebrate vision 30:




The retinols are oxidized to the corresponding retinals by alcohol dehydro-
genases. The first such enzymes we examined, those of frogs and fishes, em-
ployed DPN as coenzyme 3 1. Other systems have since been found that
prefer TPN as coenzyme 32a, and recent work, as now seems inevitable, is
multiplying the numbers of such enzymes, some of which may act preferen-
tially on retinol among the alcohols (hence retinol dehydrogenases)33.


296                          1967 GEORGE WALD

    Under physiological conditions the equilibrium between retinol and retinal
 lies far over toward reduction, so far that retinol is oxidized to retinal only to
 the degree that the latter is trapped out of the system. In vitro that can be done
 with hydroxylamine, which condenses spontaneously with retinal to form
 retinal oxime: C,,HZ7HC= 0 + H,NOH+ Ci9HZ7HC= NOH + H,O. In
 the retina, opsin performs this function, trapping retinal as fast as it appears, to
 form the visual pigments 34. Thus it is opsin that regulates how much retinol is
 oxidized, and visual pigment synthesized.
    Along with this parallelism of structure, the visual pigments exhibit an ex-
traordinary parallelism of chemical behavior. The reactions one finds with
any of them are usually found, with minor variations, in all the others. The
opsins, like other proteins, are species-specific, and often are multiple within
a species, as in man. With the different opsins go differences in absorption
spectrum, stability, the kineticsof bleaching and regeneration, and other prop-
erties. Yet all the visual systems we know represent variations on a central
theme. The vertebrates play this out to the end. The invertebrates tend to cut
it short at various levels. The action of light on the known invertebrate pig-
ments ends with the production of retinal, in most instances still attached to
opsin. Also all the known visual pigments of invertebrates have retinal, as
chromophore 29a.
    Some years ago Collins, and Morton and Pitt35 provided good evidence
that in rhodopsin, retinal is bound to opsin in Schiff base linkage, by the con-
densation of the aldehyde group of retinal with an amino group of opsin:
C,,H,,HC = 0 + H,N-opsin -+ Cr9HZ7HC = N-opsin + H,O.Bowndsin
our laboratory has recently identified this amino group in cattle opsin as the
E -NH,group of lysine. He has also analyzed theneighboring covalently bound
amino acids; together with lysine they constitute a decapeptide segment of the
composition: ala3 phe3 thr pro ile E -N-retinyl lysine36. Fig. 2 shows a model of
this segment. Cattle rhodopsin as usually prepared has a molecular weight of
about 4000037. If the molecule is spherical, its diameter is about 40 Å. The
chromophore, though its molecular weight is only 282, is about 20 Å long. It
looms surprisingly large therefore in the structure of rhodopsin.
    To make visual pigments demands not only retinals 1 or 2, but the right shap-
 es of these molecules37. The retinals possess 4 carbon-to-carbon double bonds in
 the side-chain, each of which might potentially exist in either cis or trans con-
 figuration (Fig. 3). The most stable and prevalent form is the all-trans. The
 first double bond at C-7 is always trans, since hindrance between the methyl
 groups on C-1 and C-9 prevents the 7-cis linkage from forming. The 9- and

Fig. 2. Model of the chromophoric site of cattle rhodopsin, according to Bownds36. The
11-cis retinyl chromophore is attached to opsin in Schiffbase linkage through an+amino
group of lysine. The covalently bound amino acids in this neighborhood form a deca-
peptide fragment of the composition ala3 ~hes thr pro ile E-N-retinyl lysine. Their
            sequence is not yet known, and is arbitrary in this model.

13-cis forms are common; but the 11-cis linkage was recognized to be highly
improbable, since it too involves a large overlap, between the methyl group
on C-13 and the hydrogen on C-10. A cis-linkage always represents a bend
in the chain; but because of this steric hindrance the 11-cis molecule is not only
bent but twisted at the cis linkage. This departure from planarity, by inter-
fering with resonance, was expected to make the molecule so unstable that
one hardly expected to find it37,38 .
   Nevertheless it has turned out that 11-cis retinal, once prepared, is reason-
ably stable provided it is kept dark; and all the visual pigments we know that
have been analyzed to this degree, possess as chromophore 11-cis retinal, or
retinal239.
   When however a visual pigment is bleached by light, the retinal that emer-
ges is all-trans. It must be re-isomerized to the 11-cis configuration before it
can take part again in regenerating the visual pigment. Hence a cycle of cis-
trans isomerization is an intrinsic part of every visual system we know (Fig. 4).




 Fig. 4. Diagram of the rhodopsin system, showing the isomerization cycle. The bleaching
 of rhodopsin by light ends in a mixture of opsin and all-trans retinal. The latter must be
 isomerized to 11-cis before it can regenerate rhodopsin. While that is happening, much
 of it is reduced to all-trans vitamin A, most of which in turn is esterified18,32b . These
 products must be isomerized to or exchanged for their 11-cis configuration before en-
                        gaging in the resynthesis of visual pigments.

 The 9-cis isomer, which is closest in shape to 11-cis retinal, also combines
 with the opsins to yield light-sensitive pigments that behave much as do the
 visual pigments 37. We call them the iso-pigments: isorhodopsin, isoporphy-
 ropsin 39, and so on. None of them has yet been identified under physiological
 conditions in a retina. So far as we yet know, the iso-pigments are to be re-
 garded as artefacts.

    As a prelude to what is about to be said, it should be understood that when
 any single geometrical isomer of retinal in solution is exposed to light, it
 rapidly isomerizes to a steady-state mixture of all the possible isomers, in
 proportions that depend upon the wavelength of the light, and even more
 upon the polarity of the solvent 37,38b. In such a homopolar solvent as hexane,
 about 95 per cent of the final, steady-state mixture is all-trans; whereas in
 such a polar solvent as ethanol, about 50 per cent is distributed among cis
 configurations, and a surpisingly large fraction, about 25 - 30 per cent, ends as
 11-cis retinal. Though thermodynamically improbable, this is one of the most
 favored configurations of retinal40,38b .
   A few years ago Hubbard and Kropf showed that the only action of light in
vision is to isomerize the chromophore of a visual pigment from the 11-cis to
the all-trans configuration 41. Everything else that happens - chemically, phys-
iologically, indeed psychologically - represents "dark" consequences of this
one light reaction.
   This photochemical step can be isolated by bringing a visual pigment to
very low temperatures. For example, if rhodopsin in a 1:1 mixture of water
and glycerol is brought to liquid nitrogen temperature (about - 190ºC), at
which the solvent vitrifies, its absorption spectrum narrows, rises and shifts
slightly toward the red (Fig. 5) 42. Exhaustive irradiation with blue light shifts
the spectrum further toward the red, ending with the production of a steady-
state mixture, in which part of the chromophore is still 11-cis, hence still
rhodopsin, and the rest has been isomerized to all-trans to form the photo-
product, prelumirhodopsin (A max 543 m,u). At this point irradiation with
orange light drives the spectrum back to its original position: the orange light,
by re-isomerizing the all-trans chromophore to 11-cis, has re-converted all
the prelumirhodopsin back to rhodopsin. Long irradiation with green light
can drive the spectrum to still shorter wavelengths, by isomerizing the 11-cis
chromophore to 9-cis; the pigment is now isorhodopsin. Irradiation of the
isorhodopsin with blue light again yields the same steady-state mixture of
rhodopsin and prelumirhodopsin as before. In this way one can go back and
forth without loss as often as one likes, among rhodopsin (11-cis), prelumi-
rhodopsin (all-trans) and isorhodopsin (9-cis). At liquid nitrogen tempera-
ture this is a perfectly reversible system.
   Comparable changes occur in squid rhodopsin43, chicken iodopsin44, and
as I have just learned from Yoshizawa, now back in Osaka, in carp porphy-
ropsin 45. It is interesting that in all these cases the prelumi photoproduct,
though the first step in bleaching, is a more intense pigment than the visual

Fig. 5. Interconversion of rhodopsin and prelumirhodopsin by light at liquid nitrogen
temperature. Cattle rhodopsin in I : I glycerol-water (I) is cooled to -195ºC (2). On
long irradiation with blue light (440 mµ) the spectrum moves to (3). The light has isom-
erized the 11-cis chromophore of rhodopsin to a steady-state mixture of rhodopsin
and prelumirhodopsin (all-trans). Irradiation with orange light (600 mp) re-isomerizes
all the all-trans chromophore back to 11-cis: it is now again all rhodopsin (4). Reirradia-
tion with blue light brings it back again to the steady-state mixture (5). On warming in
the dark to 25ºC, the prelumirhodopsin in this mixture bleaches to all-trans retinal and
opsin, the retinal condensing with hydroxylamine to yield retinal oxime (λmax367 mµ);
the rhodopsin in the mixture remains unchanged. This product was re-cooled to -195º
and its spectrum recorded (6). Finally it was warmed again and bleached completely to
           all-trans retinal oxime and opsin (7). From Yoshizawa and Wald42.
pigment itself, its spectrum both shifted toward the red and considerably taller
than that of the visual pigment.
   As already said, the irradiation of rhodopsin with blue light at liquid ni-
trogen temperature produces a steady-state mixture of rhodopsin and pre-
lumirhodopsin. On gradual warming in the dark, the latter goes at specific
critical temperatures through a progression of intermediate stages - lumirho-
dopsin, metarhodopsin I, metarhodopsin II - representing stepwise changes in
the conformation of opsin (Fig. 6). Finally the Schiff base linkage hydrolyzes
to yield all-trans retinal and opsin 4 6. In the course of these transformations
new groups on opsin are exposed: two sulfhydryl (-S H) groups per mole-
cule 47, and one proton-binding group with pKabout 6.6, perhaps imidazole 48.
   Literal bleaching in the sense of loss of color occurs mainly between meta-
rhodopsins I and II. Visual excitation must have occurred by the time meta
II is formed (Fig. 7). This stage is reached within about 1 msec at mammalian
body temperature 4 9. All subsequent changes are much too slow to be involved
in excitation.

liquid nitrogen temperature and then gradually warming in the dark. Irradiation at
-195º yields steady-state mixtures of rhodopsin (11-cis) with prelumirhodopsin (all-
trans) and isorhodopsin (9-cis) in proportions that depend on the wavelength of irradia-
tion. On warming in the dark, prelumirhodopsin goes at certain critical temperatures
over a succession of all-trans intermediates to a final mixture of all-trans retinal and opsin.

Up to metarhodopsin II, the all-trans chromophore has remained attached
to opsin at the same site. So long as that is so, the absorption of a photon, by
isomerizing the all-trans chromophore to II-cis immediately regenerates
rhodopsin ( Fig. 5 ) .
    We have been in the habit of saying that light bleaches visual pigments.
 What it does however is to isomerize the chromophore. The end of this pro-
 cess, if it is allowed to go to completion, is a steady- state mixture of isomers of
 the chromophore, in proportions that depend upon the wavelength of irra-
 diation and the relative quantum efficiencies of the photoreactions. A first
 photon absorbed by rhodopsin can isomerize its 11-cis chromophore to all-
 trans, the initial step in bleaching. The absorption of a second photon, how-
 ever, by any of the all-trans intermediates of bleaching can re-isomerize the
 chromophore to 11-cis, regenerating rhodopsin; or to 9-cis, forming iso-
 rhodopsin. Light not only bleaches visual pigments, but can regenerate them
 or the iso-pigments, depending upon the circumstances.
  The final states of bleaching still present problems. Under conditions that

Fig.7. Stages in the bleaching of rhodopsin. The chromophore of rhodopsin, 11-cis
retinal, fits closely a section of the opsin structure. The only action of light is to isomerize
retinal from the 11-cis to the all-trans configuration (prelumirhodopsin). Then the
structure of opsin opens progressively (lumi- and the metarhodopsins), ending in the
hydrolysis of retinal from opsin. Bleaching occurs in going from metarhodopsin I to II;
andvisual excitation must have occurred by this stage. The opening of opsin exposes new
chemical groups, including two -SH groups and one H+-binding group. The absorp-
tion maxima shown are for prelumirhodopsin at -190ºC, lumirhodopsin at -65ºC,

promote a surge of metarhodopsin 11 - notably the exposure of a rhodopsin
solution or dark-adapted retina to a short, intense irradiation and recording its
consequences in the dark - one finds it flowing in part back into the form of a
more highly colored product, so that the absorption in the visible region,
having fallen (metarhodopsin II), rises again (Figs. 6,8). I saw this happening

change in cattle rhodopsin solutions and frog retinas46. This seems also to be
what Hagins observed after flashing excised rabbit eyes (his product C)49.
This product (A,,, about 465 mp) resembles metarhodopsin I in spectrum
 and has sometimes been confused with it. It may be called pararhodopsin. It is
formed from metarhodopsin II in the dark, and more rapidly in the light.
Light also drives it back to metarhodopsin II, so that depending upon the
 wavelength of irradiation one can push this intermediate back and forth be-
 tween these two states. In the dark, pararhodopsin decays to retinal and op-
 sin46. Whether it is an essential intermediate or a bypass in the bleaching of
 rhodopsin, and whether on irradiation it can directly regenerate rhodopsin all
 require further analysis51.
    I must confess to having become somewhat bored with such minutiae of the
final stages of bleaching, which come much too late to have anything to do
with visual excitation. They have suddenly taken on a new interest, however,
owing to an astonishing development. Having had nothing to do with this, I
can praise it freely. For generations past the chemistry of vision and its elec-
trophysiology have travelled separate paths. Suddenly many of the details of
the bleaching and regeneration of visual pigments are emerging in a new class
of electrical responses.
   The arrangements are familiar by which one measures an electroretino-
gram (ERG) (Fig.9). An active electrode on the cornea and an indifferent
electrode elsewhere on the eye or on the body connect through an amplifier




or early receptor potential (ERP) in a dark-adapted vertebrate eye. Each of these re-
sponses is a biphasic fluctuation of potential, involving cornea-positive (upward) and
cornea-negative (downward) components. Unlike the ERG, the ERP has no measur-
able latency. For both types of response to be comparable in amplitude, the flash that
     stimulates the ERP must be of the order of I million times more intense.

to an oscilloscope. On exposing the eye to a flash of light there is a silent period
lasting at least 1.5 msec even in a mammal, and much longer at lower tem-
peratures; then a biphasic fluctuation of potential, the characteristic a- and b-
waves of the ERG. One would suppose that the latent interval before the re-
sponse represents the time needed to bleach the visual pigment to the critical
stage, and for secondary events, including the large build-up of amplification,
that lead to the response.
   About three years ago K. T. Brown and Murakami found a new electrical
response that fills in this interval-the early receptor potential (ERP) (Fig.
8)52. It has no measurable latency. Ordinarily it takes a flash about one million
times as intense as would produce a moderate ERG to evoke an ERP of about
the same amplitude. The ERP also is biphasic, consisting of a rapid cornea-
positive wave (RI) followed by a slow cornea-negative wave (R2). In the
cold (5ºC and below), RI appears-alone 53.
   It is becoming increasingly clear that the ERP has its source in the action of
light on the visual pigments themselves. One can get an ERP in retinas cooled
to -30ºC, heated to 48ºC, bathed in glycerol solutions, or fixed in glutaral-
dehyde. All it requires is intact - and oriented - rhodopsin. In the membranes
that compose the rod outer segments rhodopsin is almost perfectly oriented 54.
If the orientation is destroyed by heating, the ERP goes with it55.
   A recent experiment demonstrates the immediacy of these relationships. A
flash of light acting on the rhodopsin of a dark adapted retina having evoked
the usual ERP, another flash acting on an intermediate stage of bleaching
(probably para- and meta-rhodopsin II) so as to photoregenerate rhodopsin
produces a biphasic ERP of reversed polarity (Fig. 10)56a. That is, the isomer-
ization from all-trans to 11-cis induces similar-changes of potential reversed
in sign.
    Such experiments with rat and squid retinas have begun to identify indi-
vidual components of the ERP with the photoreactions of specific inter-
mediates in the bleaching of rhodopsin 5 6 a , b . It is hard to see how intramolec-
ular changes of this kind, presumably involving charge displacements, can
generate changes of potential between the front and back of the eye; but
there is no doubt that they do, and we can only hope eventually to understand
them. There is as yet no evidence that the ERP generated by rhodopsin itself
is part of the mechanism of excitation; obviously the action of flashes of light
on intermediates of bleaching, though they generate various forms of ERP,
do not excite. At the least, the ERP offers a new and powerful tool for study-
ing the reactions of the visual pigments in situ.

rat. Both the test flash and the bleaching light were composed of long wavelengths pri-
marily absorbed by rhodopsin. The blue photoregenerating flash contained wavelengths
absorbed by longer-lived intermediates of bleaching (apparently mainly metarhodopsin
II and pararhodopsin). The control trace was obtained from a second eye subjected to
the same bleaching light and test flashes, but without the interpolated blue flash. 27ºC.
The first test flash yields a normal ERP. The bleaching light having removed rhodopsin, a
second test flash yields nothing, even though the amplification is increased (see gain
index at right). A blue flash, photoregenerating rhodopsin, yields an ERP of reversed
polarity. The third test flash, yielding again a normal ERP (high gain!) shows that the
blue flash did regenerate rhodopsin. The control flash shows that without the interpolated
       blue flash, no response is obtained (high gain): From R.A.Cone 56a.

For many centuries man was the only object of visual investigation. Re-
cently he has again become for many purposes the experimental animal of
choice. In certain ways experimenting with man offers unique advantages.
With other animals one can pursue a biophysics, but only with man also a
psychophysics. Moreover human genetics is by now probably better under-
stood than that of any other animal; and with man one does not have to seek
out mutant forms - their curiosity and anxiety bring them in.
  A few years ago Paul Brown designed and built a recording microspectro-
photometer in which one could measure the difference spectra of visual pig-
ments in small fragments of retina 57. With this one could record the differ-


306                        1967 GEORGE WALD

ence spectrum of the visual pigments in the rod-free area of the human fovea.
Just as the spectrum of human rhodopsin agrees with the spectral sensitivity
of human rod vision58, so the spectrum of the fovea1 pigments accounts for
the spectral sensitivity of human cone vision59.
    The human cones however are the receptors of color vision. Since Thomas
 Young it has been recognized that normal human color vision is trivariant; it
 involves the interplay of three independent variables. A prevalent thought for
many years past has been that it involves three types of cone, each with its
 own visual pigment.
    By irradiating human and monkey foveas with deep red light in the micro-
 spectrophotometer, we were able to bleach the red-sensitive pigment alone,
and measure its difference spectrum (AzaX about 565 mp). When red light
 caused no further change, yellow light induced a renewed bleaching that
 yielded the difference spectrum of the green-sensitive pigment (A,,, about
 535 mp)59. Presumably there was also a blue-sensitive pigment, that could
 not be measured adequately with these arrangements.
    Shortly afterward it proved possible to measure in the microspectrophotom-
 eter the difference spectra of the visual pigments in single parafoveal rods
 and cones of human and monkey retinas. Such measurements were made si-
 multaneously and independently in our laboratory and by Marks, Dobelle
 and MacNichol at Johns Hopkins University60a,b. They showed that primate
 retinas possess, in addition to rods with their rhodopsin, three kinds of cone,
 blue-, green- and red-sensitive, each containing predominantly or exclu-
 sively one of three color-vision pigments, with&, at about 435, 540 and
 565 rnp (Fig. 11).
    The red- and green-sensitive pigments, after being bleached by light, are
 regenerated by adding 11-cis retinal in the dark59. The same seems to be true
 of the blue-sensitive pigment. Since all the visual pigments of the primate
 retina, rod and cone, apparently have the same chromophore, 11-cis retinal,
 they must differ in their opsins.
    The iodopsins, with A,,, near 560 rnp, and cyanopsins, with Amax near 620
 m,u, are widely distributed among animals. Iodopsin is the major, perhaps the
  only, cone pigment in the chicken, pigeon30b, cat, snake and frog61; just as
 cyanopsin seems to be the cone pigment of such retinol, animals as the tench
 and tortoise62, a freshwater turtle and frog tadpoles 63. In the few vertebrates
  whose color vision systems have been analyzed, these pigments are apparently
  the red-sensitive components. So in man and the monkey, the red-sensitive
 pigment of color vision is apparently iodopsin59; just as it is cyanopsin in

                                        pairs of visual pigments resembling in
 spectrum rhodopsin and iodopsin have been found in two species of cray-
 fish 66; and here again the "iodopsins" seem to be the red- sensitive components
 in systems of color discrimination67.
    A simple psychophysical procedure has recently been developed for meas-
 uring the spectral sensitivities of the three groups of cones in human sub-
      68
jects . This is a highly simplified extension of the procedure by which W. S.
 Stiles first measured such sensitivity curves 69. In my application of this proce-
 dure, the eye is continuously adapted to bright colored lights, each of which
 so lowers the sensitivities of two of the three color-vision mechanisms that
 the measurements report primarily the properties of the third system. So, for
 example, exposure of the eye to a brilliant yellow light so lowers the sensi-
 tivities of the green-and red-sensitive systems that measurements of the
 spectral sensitivity are dominated by the blue-sensitive system. Similarly ex-
 posure to wave bands in the blue and red, hence purple light, isolates the
 green-sensitive system; and exposure to bright blue light isolates the red-
 sensitive system. The sensitivity curves measured in this way come out much

blue-sensitive, two green-sensitive and two red-sensitive cones. Each of these difference
spectra was obtained by recording in the microspectrophotometer the "dark" and then
the "bleached" spectra from 650 to 380    rnp and again in the reverse direction. Then the
"bleached" spectra were subtracted from the "dark" spectra, and both curves averaged.
The absorbances at A,,,, shown at the upper right, indicate the amounts by which these
preparations bleached in the course of the two recordings. The second recording, from
380 to 650 mp, always displays a somewhat smaller absorbance, owing to bleaching.

Fig.13. Measurements of spectral sensitivity with a standardized selective adaptation
procedure in a normal subject (trichromat), and typical subjects representing each of the
three main classes of colorblindness (dichromats). In the normal eye this procedure dis-
plays the spectral sensitivity of the dark adapted fovea (D), and those of the blue-, green-
and red-sensitive systems (B,G,R), as measured respectively on intense yellow, purple
or blue backgrounds. Each of the colorblinds reveals the operation of only two of the
three color-vision pigments; in each case the attempt to measure the third pigment
reveals only one of the other mechanisms at a lower level of sensitivity. The crossed out
symbols B, G and R represent such unsuccessful attempts to measure the missing systems

as do the difference spectra of the pigments measured in the microspectro-
photometer (Fig. 12).
   With this simple procedure one can inquire into mechanisms of color
blindness 70 . Just as normal human color-vision is trivariant (trichromatic),
that of the usual congenital color-blind is divariant (dichromatic). Theoret-
ically the reduction from three variables to two could occur in many ways,
and at any level in the visual pathways. By now however I have examined a
reasonably large number of dichromats with this procedure; each of them
apparently lacks one of the three color mechanisms, the other two remaining
normal and fully functional (Fig. 12). Depending upon which component is
lacking, the three major classes of dichromat can be characterized as blue-,
green- or red-blind.
 Every schoolboy learns that color blindness is caused by a sex-linked reces-


           MOLECULAR BASIS OF VISUAL EXCITATION                             309
sive mutation. That is true however only of red- and green- blindness. About
1 per cent of men are red-blind, about 2 per cent green- blind, whereas both
conditions are very rare in women. Blue-blindness also is very rare, and not
sex-linked, affecting only about 1 in 20000 persons, about 40 percent of whom
are women71.
   There is another, more widespread congenital color defect, red-or green-
anomaly, closely related to red- and green-blindness. Persons with this
condition have three-color vision, but make abnormal color matches. Ex-
amined by my procedure, they yield the same type of result as red-or green-
blinds, showing that one of their three color mechanisms is abnormally insen-
sitive, so much so that my procedure does not detect it; in addition, to account
for their abnormal color matches this aberrant system must be displaced in
spectrum. In one instance, that of a blue-blind subject who was also green-
anomalous, the displaced sensitivity curve of the green-receptor could be
measured 70. It lay about midway between the normal green- and red-sensi-
tive curves, a position that accounts well for the abnormal color matches.
   One of the triumphs of modern biology is to have shown that the usual
business of a gene is to specify the amino acid sequence of a protein. For many
years geneticists have been unable to decide whether red- and green-blind-
ness involve one or two gene loci on the X-chromosome. I think the demon-
stration that two different proteins, two opsins, are needed to form the red-
and green-sensitive pigments settles this issue59.
   Normal human vision requires the synthesis of four different opsins: one in
the rods, to make rhodopsin, and three in the cones, for the color-vision pig-
ments. Each of these must be specified by a different gene. It seems reasonable
to assume that two such genes, lying close together in the X-chromosome,
specify the opsins of the normal red- and green-sensitive pigments (Fig.13)70.
Mutations in these genes that result in the failure to form either pigment
probably account for red- or green-blindness. Other mutations at the same
loci, resulting in the formation of abnormally small amounts of visual pig-
ments with displaced spectra, may account for red- and green-anomaly. All
these conditions breed true, the normal condition being dominant to color
anomaly, which in turn is dominant to color-blindness as expected. The mu-
tation responsible for blue-blindness must be autosomal; and there is some
evidence that it is inherited as an irregular dominant, though too few blue-
blind genealogies are yet available to characterize the genetics reliably72.
   A recent investigation, taking off from earlier observations by König 73 and
Willmer and Wright74, introduces an altogether different aspect of color

Fig. 13. Diagram showing a hypothetical arrangement of genes that specify the three op -
sins which, with 11-cis retinal, form the blue-, green- and red-sensitive pigments (B, G,
R) of normal human color-vision. Two such genes on the X-chromosome are assumed
to determine G and R. Mutations in these genes that result in the production of less
effective pigments, displaced in spectrum, are responsible for color-anomaly; and other
mutations that result in the failure to form functional visual pigments result in color
blindness. The normal condition is dominant to red- or green-anomaly, which in turn
is dominant to red- or green-blindness. The location of the gene for the opsin of the
normal blue-sensitive pigment is not known; but the mutation responsible for blue-
blindness seems clearly to be autosomal, since this condition is almost equally distributed
      between males and females; and it may be dominant to the normal condition.

blindness. A small, central patch of the normal fovea, subtending a visual
angle of about 7-8 minutes and hence hardly larger than the fixation alea, is
blue-blind in the sense of lacking functional blue-sensitive cones (Fig. 14)75.
This is a matter of retinal topography, not of size of field, for blue-sensitive
cones are well represented in a field of this size fixated elsewhere in the fovea
or in the peripheral retina. Blue-blindness, though by far the rarest form of
congenital color blindness, appears to be the usual condition of the fixation
area of the fovea.
    This intrusion of color blindness at the center of the normal fovea recalls the
 old and often-repeated observation that other, more peripheral areas of the
 normal retina are red-or green-blind; and that areas still further out are to-
 tally color-blind (Fig. 15). It is difficult to make good color-vision experi-
 ments in such outlying areas, and much remains to be done. Nevertheless it
 now seems possible that all the classic forms of color blindness, including total
 color blindness, are represented in the normal retina.
    What we regard as normal trichromatic vision appears now to be only the
special property of a broad annulus of retina stretching from the blue-blind
fixation area at the center to about 20-30º out (Fig. 15). Most of the normal
 retina is color blind. The mechanisms of color blindness in the peripheral

either centrally or 7/16º from the fixation point. At the center of the fovea, though G
and R are well represented, all attempts to measure B result only in finding G or R at
lower levels of sensitivity. As soon as the field is moved away from the fixation area, B
appears; simultaneously G and R decline somewhat in sensitivity, owing probably to

 normal human retina. The fixation area is blue-blind, in the sense of lacking functional
 blue-sensitive cones. From there to about 20-30º from the fixation point is trichromatic.
 Beyond this range, to perhaps 70-80º out, the retina behaves as though red- or green-
 blind; and still further out as totally colorblind ( monochromatic). Thenature of periph-
 eral colorblindness and its mechanisms are stil to be explored; yet it seems possible
 that all the classic forms of colorblindness are represented in various zones of the normal
                                          retina.

retina - whether the lack of certain classes of cone or the reduction or fusion of
nerve channels from the cones - must still be explored.
   However this comes out, it raises an altogether different kind of problem
from that of congenital color blindness: not what pigments the organism can
make, but how it distributes those pigments and the cells that contain them.
That takes us from molecular genetics to questions of embryogeny and cell
differentiation. The human retina, with its complex topography and radial
zonation may be a particularly fortunate place to study such problems.
Looking back over this account I am struck with the thought that some of the
most significant aspects of the photoreceptor process come from its being laid
out in two dimensions: on the molecular level, in two-dimensional arrays of
oriented molecules, the membranes that compose the photoreceptor organ-
elles; and on the cellular level, in the single layer of receptor cells that com-
poses the retinal mosaic. In these arrangements each molecule of visual pigment
and each receptor cell can report on its own. The absorption of a single photon
by any molecule of rhodopsin among the many millions that a dark-adapted
rod contains can excite it76; and the early receptor potential signals in detail
the synchronized reactions of populations of the visual pigment molecules.
 Similarly, quite apart from the skilful electrophysiological procedures that
measure directly the responses of single retinal units, we have no great
 difficulty in sampling, through their differences in spectral absorption and
 sensitivity, the properties and behavior of each receptor type over the surface
 of such highly variegated retinas as that of man.
    Looking back also I feel deep regret to have left out of this account so much
 that is important: the early and fundamental studies on the photochemistry of
 rhodopsin by Lythgoe, Dartmall and Goodeve, for example; Tansley’s digi-
 tonin to extract visual pigments; Dartnall’s realization that when plotted on a
 frequency scale almost all visual pigments have nearly the same shape of
 spectrum; Denton’s first direct spectrophotometry of retinas; Rushton’s and
 Weale’s pioneering ophthalmoscopic measurements of human color vision
 pigments; and much more.
 I am glad however to see that each part of this account ends in mid-career,
which of course is just as I would want it.
