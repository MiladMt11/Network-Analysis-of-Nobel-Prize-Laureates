INTRODUCTION

Many key concepts concerning the nature of immunity have originated from
the very practical need to control virus infections. This year, 1996, has been
designated the "Year of the Vaccine" commemorating the 200th anniversary
of Edward Jenner's vaccination of James Phipps with cowpox virus, and sub­
sequent challenge with smallpox virus. Insight into the nature of viruses, and
how viruses interact with mammalian cells, has evolved since the turn of the
century. Our concepts of immunity developed concurrently, beginning with
Pasteur's treatment of Joseph Meissner with "aged" rabies virus. Antibody-me­
diated protection conferred by attenuated, live yellow fever virus won the
Nobel Prize for Max Theiler in 1951. Perhaps the most exciting area of im­
munology when I graduated from the University of Queensland Veterinary
School in 1962 was the nature of virus neutralization (1), a topic that is still
being resolved with the monoclonal antibody (mAb) technology originated
by Georges Kohler and Cesar Milstein (Nobel Prize 1985). Crystallographic
analysis of influenza virus neuraminidase-mAb complexes, and variants of
neuraminidase selected by mAbs, led to the clear demonstration that lg mol­
ecules normally bind to tertiary structure on proteins (2).
  The present award is for our discovery (3-6) from experiments with lym­
phocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) that the nature of T cell-mediated
immunity (CMI) is essentially different, focusing on the recognition of cell­
surface major histocompatibility complex (MHC) glycoproteins that have
been modified as a consequence of infection. My intention here is to place
these findings in historical context, and to develop some aspects to the pre­
sent day in the context of viral immunity and pathology.


THE AUSTRALIAN SCHOOL OF VIRAL PATHOGENESIS
AND IMMUNITY

The strengths in both virology and immunology at the John Curtin School of
Medical Research (JCSMR) where we did the LCMV experiments were a di­
rect consequence of themes developed in Australia by F.M. (Sir Mac) Burnet.
Over a period of more than 20 years, Sir Mac built the Walter and Eliza Hall
Institute (WEHI) in Melbourne into a major international center for virus

 (particularly influenza) research. In the late l 940's the only person working
there on another virus disease was Frank Fenner, who at Burnet's suggestion
 studied the epidemiology and pathogenesis of ectromelia (mousepox).
Following Burnet's demonstration that ectromelia could be titrated by pock
assay on chick chorioallantoic membrane, Fenner did careful quantitative
studies of virus distribution in a range of tissues (7). His conclusion was that
the virus replicated initially at the site of inoculation in the dermis, then the
regional lymph nodes, then generalized via the liver and spleen, and again to
the skin, where it produced a smallpox-like rash. He also noted that delayed
type "allergy" appeared earlier than serum antibody. In 1949 Fenner became
head of the Department of Microbiology in the .JCSMR at the Australian
National University, which had just been formed largely as a consequence of
initiatives taken by Sir Howard (later Lord) Florey (Nobel Prize 1945).
Fenner built a very strong center for virology research.
   In 1957, having just enunciated the clonal selection theory (8), Burnet
abandoned virology and re-directed the work of the WEHI to basic immuno­
logy, a focus continued with great distinction by his protege GJV. Nossa!.
Nossa! recruitedJ.F.A.P. Miller, who established a strong program in T-cell im­
munology that was to have major influence both locally and on the interna­
tional scene. Some of the WEHI virologists joined Fenner's department in
Canberra. One of the few remaining in Melbourne was G.L. Ada, who
switched to immunology. Gordon Ada then moved to Canberra in 1968,
replacing Fenner who had become Director of the JCSMR. By the time that I
arrived, the microbiology department in Canberra had a strong research ef�
fort in immunology, interfacing with the virologists remaining from the
Fenner era.
   Fcnner's ectromelia model was subsequently pursued at the .JCSMR in two
ways that were to influence our discovery. The first was that C.A. Mims made
extensive use of fluorescence microscopy to define patterns of virus growth in
diferent organ sites (9), helping to keep the general area of whole-animal vi­
    f


ral pathogenesis alive through the l 960's, when most virologists (following
Ender's, Weller and Robbins, Nobel Prize I 954) turned their attention to in
vitro tissue culture systems. Fenner's final contribution to experimental viral
immunology was to recruit R.V. Blanden back to Australia from the Trudeau
Institute, where he had been working with George Mackaness (a Florey
trainee and former.JCSMR scientist) on CMI in bacterial infections ( I 0). Bob
Blanden applied the approaches that he had developed with Mackancss to
the ectromelia model, using both adoptive transfer experiments and deple­
tion with anti-thymocyte serum to show the crucial role of T lymphocytes in
controlling the infection (11-13).
   I had followed Mim's papers for many years, and returned to Australia
from Edinburgh at the end of 1971 to work with him. He had warned me that
he might be moving to a Chair in Microbiology in London, and left before
the end of 1972. I inherited his laboratory, his technician (Gail Essery) and
the LCMV model that had been brought to Canberra some years before by
Fritz Lehmann-Grube. Rolf Zinkernagel arrived in 1973, to work with Blan-
