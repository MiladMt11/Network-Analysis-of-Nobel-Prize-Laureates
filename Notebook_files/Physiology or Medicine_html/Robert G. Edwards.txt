Cambridge University, Cambridge, UK.
Today we are here to celebrate the achievements of Robert Edwards. It is 
however a celebration tinged with sadness. Sadness that Bob himself is not 
well enough to be here in person, so in preparing this lecture, I have tried to 
weave into it some of Bob’s written and spoken words. Sadness also that neither Patrick Steptoe (1913–1988; Fig. 1) [1] nor Jean Purdy (1946–1985; Fig. 
2) [2], two of his key collaborators, are alive to celebrate with him.
TO BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING
Robert Geoffrey Edwards was born on the 27th of September 1925 in the 
small Yorkshire mill town of Batley. He arrived into a working-class family, 
the second of three brothers − an older brother, Sammy and a younger, 
Harry. These brothers Bob describes as competitive, “all determined to win 
or, if not to win, to go down fighting” [3]. Bob’s mother, Margaret, was a 
machinist in a local mill. She came originally from Manchester, to where 
the family relocated when Bob was about 5, and where he was educated. In 
those days, bright working class kids could take a scholarship exam at age 
10 or 11 in competition for the few coveted places at a grammar school: the 
potential pathway out of poverty and even to University. All three brothers 
passed the exam, but Sammy decided against Grammar School, preferring 
to leave education as soon as he could to start earning. His mother was 
furious at this wasted opportunity, and so when her two younger sons passed 
the exam, there was no question but that they would continue in education. 
So it was that Bob progressed in 1937 to Manchester Central Boy’s High 
School, which, incidentally, also claims Sir James Chadwick, FRS (1891–
1974), another Cambridge professor and Nobel Laureate (in Physics in 1935 
for discovery of the neutron [4]), as a former pupil. Bob’s summers were 
spent in the Yorkshire Dales, where their mother took her sons to be closer to 
their father’s place of work. There Bob laboured on the farms and developed 
an enduring love for the place.

These early experiences were formative for Bob. He became a life–long 
egalitarian, for five years a Labour Party councillor [5], willing to listen to 
and to talk with all and sundry, regardless of class, education, status and 
background. Second, he developed an enduring love for and curiosity about 
natural history and especially the reproductive patterns that he observed 
among the farm’s sheep, pigs and cattle in the Dales. Finally, he took great 
pride in being a ‘Yorkshire man’ – with traditional attributes of affability 
and generosity of spirit combined with no-nonsense blunt-speaking. Indeed, 
following his only meeting with Gregory Pincus (1903–1967) [6] at a conference in Venice in May 1966, at which Bob, the young pretender, clashed with 
the ‘father of the pill’ over the timing of egg maturation in humans, Bob 
paid Pincus the biggest compliment he could imagine, saying “He would 
have made a fine Yorkshireman!” [7].

The aftermath of war was to provide an extended interruption to Bob’s 
education: when he left school in 1943, he was conscripted into the British 
Army for almost four years. To his surprise as someone who was from a 
working class family, he was identified as potential officer material and sent 
on an officer-training course, before being commissioned in 1946 (Fig. 3). 
However, the alien life-style of the officers’ mess was not to his taste and 
served to reinforce his socialist ideals. The years in the army were broken by 
9 months compassionate leave back in the Dales, to which he was released to 
help out when his farmer friend there became ill. So engaged did he become 
in farming life that, after discharge from the army in 1948, he returned 
home to Manchester, from where he applied to read agricultural sciences at 
the University College of North Wales at Bangor.

Having gained a place and a grant to fund it, the 6 or so months that 
intervened were occupied in a Government desk job in Salford, Greater 
Manchester, work experience that reinforced the attractions of agricultural 
science. So his disappointment in the course offered at Bangor was acute. By 
that time he was an experienced 23 year old, described by his impressionable 
18 year old public-school educated and self-described “unlikely” friend John 
Slee (Fig. 4), as being “both ambitious and flexible, and unusually confident 
in his own judgement” [8]. And in Bob’s confident judgement, the course 
on offer was not ‘scientific’, and he was bored through two tedious years 
of agricultural descriptions, after which he reported that his teachers were 
“glad to see the back of him” in Zoology for a year. The Zoology Department 
offered a course much more to his style and led by the more intellectually 
challenging Rogers Brambell, FRS (1901–1970) [9]. However, that year was 
not enough to salvage an honours degree, and in 1951, aged 26 he gained 
a simple pass. Unbeknown to him at the time, he was not alone in this 
undistinguished academic embarrassment, as neither “Tibby” Marshall, FRS 
(1878–1949), the founder of the Reproductive Sciences [10], nor Sir Alan 
Parkes, FRS (1900–1990), the first Professor of Reproductive Sciences at 
Cambridge [11], and who was later to recruit Bob there, distinguished themselves as undergraduates. In 1951, however, Bob “was disconsolate. It was a 
disaster. My grants were spent and I was in debt. Unlike some of the students 
I had no rich parents… I could not write home, ‘Dear Dad, please send me 
£100 as I did badly in the exams.’” [12]. 
Characteristically, however, Bob’s low spirits did not last long. He learned 
that John Slee had been accepted on a Diploma course in Animal Genetics 
Figure 4. John Slee, 1963 (courtesy Ruth 
Edwards).

at Edinburgh University under Conrad Waddington, FRS (1905–1975) [13]. 
Bob applied, and, despite his pass degree and to his amazement, he was 
accepted. That summer, he worked in various labouring jobs to earn enough 
to pay his way in Edinburgh [14]. It is tempting to see in these experiences 
of the youthful Bob Edwards consequences for his later approach to life: he 
learned that the accepted hierarchies of organisation and ideas were there to 
be challenged, not simply accepted, and that recovery was possible after what 
might seem the severest of knock-backs. These were lessons that Bob was to 
draw on later in his career. 
In Edinburgh, Bob not only started to map out his scientific career, but 
importantly also met Ruth Fowler (Fig. 5), who was to become his life-long 
scientific collaborator, and whom he was to marry in 1954, their five daughters following between 1959 and 1964: Caroline, Sarah, Jenny, and twins, 
Anna and Meg. Bob initially found himself somewhat overwhelmed, even 
“intimidated” by Ruth’s august family background. Her father, Sir Ralph 
Fowler, FRS (1889–1944) [15], and her maternal grandfather, Lord Ernest 
Rutherford, FRS (1871–1937) [16], were not only both ‘titled’, but both 
also had the most impressive academic credentials imaginable. Ralph Fowler 
was Plummer Professor of Mathematical Physics in Cambridge from 1932 to 
1944, whilst Rutherford was the first Nobel Laureate in Ruth’s family, having 
been awarded the 1908 Nobel Prize in Chemistry ‘for his investigations 
into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive 
substances’.

BOB EDWARDS, THE RESEARCH SCIENTIST
The intellectual spirit of scientific enquiry that Bob experienced in 
Edinburgh obviously fitted his aptitudes perfectly, for Waddington rewarded 
his Diploma year with a three year PhD place and funded it with the princely 
sum of £240.00 per year [17]. Bob’s chosen field of research was the developmental biology of the mouse. Bob saw that to understand development 
involved engaging in an interdisciplinary mix, not just of embryology and 
reproduction, the conventional view at the time, but also of genetics. Given 
the scientific and social emphasis on genetics over the last 40 or so years, it 
is difficult now to realise how advanced a view this was in the 1950s, when 
genetic knowledge was still rudimentary and largely alien to the established 
developmental and reproductive biologists of the day, as Bob himself was 
later to comment [18]. For example, it was in the 1950s that DNA was established as the molecular carrier of genetic information [19–22], that it was 
first demonstrated that each cell of the body carried a full set of DNA/genes 
[23–25], and that genes were selectively expressed as mRNA to generate 
different cell phenotypes [26]. Perhaps of greater importance for Bob at that 
time, it was only by the late 1950s that cytogenetic studies led to the accepted 
human karyotype as 46 chromosomes [27–28], that agreement was reached 
on the Denver system of classification of human chromosomes [29], and that 
the chromosomal aneuploidies underlying developmental anomalies such as 
Down, Turner and Klinefelter Syndromes were described [30–32].

1950s (possibly 1957).

Bob worked under his supervisor, Alan Beatty, to generate haploid, 
triploid and aneuploid mouse embryos and studied their potential for normal 
development. In order to undertake what were, in effect, early attempts at 
‘genetic engineering’ in mammals, he needed to be able to manipulate the 
chromosomal composition of eggs, sperm and embryos. Whilst in mice, 
sperm were abundant, eggs were not, and overcoming this deficit led him 
to two major discoveries that proved to be of later significance. First, with 
Ruth, they worked to devise ways of increasing the numbers of synchronised 
eggs recoverable from adult female mice through a series of papers on the 
control of ovulation induced by use of exogenous hormones [33]. In doing 
so, they overturned the conventional wisdom that super-ovulation of adult 
females was not possible. Second, working with an American post-doc, Alan 
Gates (Fig. 6), Bob described the remarkable timed sequence of egg chromosomal maturation events that led up to ovulation after injection of the ovulatory hormone (human chorionic gonadotrophin; hCG) [34]. His six years, 
between 1951 and 1957, in Edinburgh give an early taste of his prodigious 
energy, resulting in 38 papers. Indeed so productive was this period that the 
last of the papers resulting from his Edinburgh work did not appear in print 
until 1963.
It was also in Edinburgh that Bob’s interest in ethics was first sparked 
by the interdisciplinary debates among scientists and theologians that 
Waddington organised, and, as a result, Bob went on what he describes as a 
“church crawl”, trying the ten of so variants of Christianity on offer in 1950s 
Edinburgh. He did not emerge from his consumer testing “God-intoxicated” 
[35], but convinced that man held his own future in his own hands. Bob’s 
humanist ethical sympathies were to be developed further in all his later 
encounters.
AN AMERICAN DIVERSION
These early 1950s studies in science and ethics were to form the platform 
on which Bob’s later IVF work was to be based, but before that his interests 
and life took a diversion to the California Institute of Technology for the 
year 1957–8. Bob describes his year at CalTech as being “a bit of a holiday”, 
but it was a holiday which, with hindsight, had distracting consequences. He 
went there to work with Albert Tyler (1906–1968) [36], an influential elder 
statesman of American reproductive science, working on sperm–egg interactions. CalTech was then a hotbed of developmental biology, and Tyler had 
clustered around him an exciting group of young scientists, which included 
that year a visit by the English doyen of fertilisation, Lord Victor Rothschild, 
FRS (1910–1990) [37], who was later to clash scientifically with Edwards over 
his IVF work [38]. In this clash, needless to say, the younger man triumphed 
[39], just as he had with Pincus. Tyler was exploring the molecular specificity of egg–sperm interactions and had turned as a model to immunology. 
Immunology was then at a very exciting phase in its development, with the 
engaging Sir Peter Medawar, FRS (1915–1987, Nobel Laureate in Physiology 
Edwards_lect_.indd 9 2011-08-29 10:11:01
244
or Medicine, 1960) [40], influentially for Bob, extending his ideas on immunological tolerance to the paradox of the ‘fetus as an allograft’: a semipaternal graft nonetheless somehow protected from maternal immune 
attack inside the mother’s uterus. This confluence of reproduction and 
immunology excited Bob’s restless curiosity and hence the choice of Tyler. 
The subject also offered funding possibilities via the Ford and Rockefeller 
Foundations and the Population Council, which were increasingly 
concerned about world population growth and the need for better methods 
to control fertility. Immuno-contraception then seemed to offer tantalisingly 
specific possibilities.
So when Bob returned to the UK from CalTech in 1958 at Alan Parkes’ 
invitation to join him at the Medical Research Council (MRC) National 
Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) at Mill Hill in north London, it was to 
work on the science of immuno-contraception [5]. This period in the USA 
initiated a series of 24 papers on the immunology of reproduction between 
1960 and 1976. It also prompted Bob’s first involvement in founding an 
international society in 1967 in Varna, Bulgaria when the International 
Coordinating Committee for the Immunology of Reproduction was created 
[41]. It was, in retrospect, to prove a distracting diversion from what was 
to become Bob’s main work, albeit one that continued to enthuse Bob for 
many years, witnessed not least by my own recruitment to enter this field 
of study with him as a graduate student in 1966. Nonetheless, the period at 
Mill Hill, between 1958 and 1962, seems to have been a period of increasing 
intellectual conflict for Bob. Whilst enthusiastically working on the science 
underlying immuno-contraception, his old interests in eggs, fertilisation 
and, in particular, the genetics of development were gradually reasserting 
themselves. His day job was therefore increasingly supplemented by evening 
and weekend flirtations with egg maturation.
THE CRUCIAL EGG MATURATION STUDIES
Bob claims that the stimulus reawakening his interests in eggs was provided 
by the then recent consensus about the number of human chromosomes 
and, more particularly the descriptions in 1959 of the pathologies in man 
that resulted from chromosomal anomalies [42]. Might these anomalies 
result from errors in the complex chromosomal dance that he and Alan 
Gates had observed in maturing mouse eggs? The possible clinical relevance 
of his work on egg maturation and aneuploidy in the mouse was becoming 
significant.
So Bob resumed his experimenting with mice, trying to mimic in vitro the 
in vivo maturation of eggs. He tried releasing the immature eggs from their 
ovarian follicles into culture medium containing the ovulatory hormone 
hCG, to see whether he could simulate their in vivo development. Amazingly 
he found it worked the first time: but it did so whether or not the hormone 
had been added. It seemed that the eggs were maturing spontaneously when 
released from their follicles. And the same happened in rats and hamsters. 
Edwards_lect_.indd 10 2011-08-29 10:11:01
245
If this also happened in humans, then the study of the chromosomal dance 
during human egg maturation was a realistic practical possibility, as was in 
vitro fertilisation and thereby studies on the genetics of early human development. However, Bob’s excitement at seeing eggs spontaneously maturing 
was temporarily blunted by his discovery that Gregory Pincus in the 1930s 
[43–44] and M.C. Chang (1908–1991) [45–46] in the 1950s had been there 
before him, using both rabbit and, Pincus claimed, human eggs. 
In order to pursue his basic science studies on maturation, he needed a 
reliable supply of human ovarian eggs. This requirement posed difficulties 
for a scientist with no medical qualifications, given the elitist attitudes and 
scientific illiteracy then prevalent amongst most of the UK’s gynaecologists. 
His break-through came initially with Molly Rose, at whose door in the 
nearby Edgeware General Hospital he arrived after a recommendation from 
a fellow kindred spirit in John Humphrey, FRS (1915–1997) [47], ten years 
Bob’s senior and the medically qualified Head of Immunology at Mill Hill. 
Notwithstanding his more privileged social background, Humphrey shared 
Bob’s passion for science, its social application and utility, and his left wing 
politics – indeed he had been a Marxist until 1940. Bob asked John if he 
knew anyone who might be helpful, and John suggested Molly Rose and 
offered to arrange an introduction. So off Bob went, and Molly Rose 
provided human ovarian biopsy samples intermittently for the next ten years.
Between 1960 and 1962, Bob tried to repeat and extend Pincus’ observations, using not only human but also dog, monkey and baboon eggs, but with 
such limited success compared with smaller rodents that in a 1962 Nature
paper [48], he carefully interprets the few maturing human and baboon eggs 
that he observed as artefacts. But by this time, Bob’s quest for human eggs, 
and his dreams of IVF and studying early aneuploidies in human embryos, 
had reached hostile ears, most notably those of the then Director of the 
Institute, Sir Charles Harington, FRS (1897–1972), who banned any work 
on human IVF at NIMR [49]. Alan Parkes was no longer able to defend Bob, 
having left in 1961 to take up his chair in Cambridge and, although he had 
asked Bob to join him, there was no post until 1963. By the time Bob left 
Mill Hill in 1962 for a year in Glasgow, he had encountered just a taste of the 
opposition to come.
THE MOVE TO CAMBRIDGE 
Bob had been invited to Glasgow University’s Biochemistry Department by 
John Paul, then the acknowledged master of tissue culture in the UK, who 
had heard of Bob’s attempts to generate stem cells from rabbit embryos [18]. 
The invitation was to result in a paper [50] remarkable for its prescience – 
the first of eight landmark papers (Table 1) that I identify in this contribution. 
It describes the production of embryonic stem cells from rabbit embryos – 
capable of proliferating through over 100 generations and of differentiating 
into various cell types. This report was published some 18 years before Evans 
and Kaufman described the derivation of ES cells from mouse embryos [51]. 
Edwards_lect_.indd 11 2011-08-29 10:11:01
246
That this work has largely been ignored by those in the stem cell field is probably mainly attributable to its being too far ahead of its time. Thus, reliable 
molecular markers for different types of cells were not available then, nor 
were appropriate techniques with which to critically test the developmental 
potential of the cultured cells.

Bob arrived in Cambridge from Glasgow in 1963. He describes how he 
immediately reacted against the then extant “misogynist public-school traditions; the exclusivity…; the privileges given to the already privileged”. But he 
set against that the “sheer beauty of the place… the concern with the truth 
and high seriousness… the ambience of scientific excellence… I was surrounded by so many talented young men and women.” [52] He continued to 
pursue both the immunology of reproduction and egg maturation, working 
furiously on the latter to collect pig, cow, sheep, the odd monkey and some 
human eggs. Eventually, he was able to show that eggs of all these species 
would indeed mature in vitro, but that the eggs of larger animals simply 
needed longer than those of smaller ones, human eggs taking some 36 hours 
rather than the 12 or less hours erroneously reported by Pincus [44]. These 
cytogenetic studies were reported in two seminal papers in 1965 [53–54], 
both of which are primarily concerned with understanding the kinetics of 
the meiotic chromosomal events. As the second landmark paper, I have selected 
the one in The Lancet, in which Bob’s breath-taking clarity of vision is evident 
as he sets out a programme of research that predicted the events of the next 
20 years and beyond (Table 2). You will notice the heavy focus on the early 
Edwards_lect_.indd 12 2011-08-29 10:11:01
247
study and detection of genetic disease compared with the slight emphasis on 
infertility alleviation, unsurprising given Bob’s research interests. Indeed, 
within three years he had, with my fellow graduate student Richard Gardner, 
provided proof of principle for preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), 
in a paper on rabbit embryo sexing published in 1968 [55] and my third 
landmark paper. Later, in the 1980s, Bob was to play a key role in promoting 
the development of PGD clinically [56], and PGD was to prove a powerful 
political tool in convincing the UK Parliament to permit research on human 
embryos. And then by 1969 he had reported the first step towards PGD in 
humans by describing IVF [57] – a fourth landmark paper in as many years.

THE PROBLEM OF FERTILISATION RESOLVED
Underlying both the 1965 and 1969 papers are two scientific struggles: the 
first being simply but critically the continuing difficulty in obtaining a regular 
supply of ovarian tissue. Local Cambridge sources proved unreliable, and 
Molly Rose was now 2–3 hours’ drive away in north-west London, so during 
the summer of 1965, Bob turned to the USA for help and initiated his now 
famous contacts with Howard and Georgeanna Jones [58], then at the Johns 
Hopkins Medical School in Baltimore. This supply of American eggs allowed 
Bob to confirm the maturation timings published in 1965 [54]. However, it 
was the second struggle that was by then occupying most of his attention, 
namely that in order to fertilise these in vitro matured eggs, he had to 
‘capacitate’ the sperm. ‘Capacitation’ is a final maturation process, which 
sperm will usually undergo physiologically in the uterus, and that is essential for 
the acquisition of fertilising competence. Failing to achieve this convincingly 
Edwards_lect_.indd 13 2011-08-29 10:11:01
248
at Johns Hopkins, he made a second transatlantic summer journey in 1966 to 
visit Luther Talbot and his colleagues at Chapel Hill. Bob applied his usual 
ingenuity to try a variety of ways to overcome the problem of sperm capacitation, but no reliable evidence for success was forthcoming [59, 60]. Then in 
1968 both struggles began to resolve.
Resolving the problem of sperm capacitation was the initial attraction to 
Bob of Patrick Steptoe’s laparoscopic technique, Bob seeing it as a way of 
recovering capacitated sperm from the oviduct [61]. However, the actual 
solution to this problem lay nearer home. Parkes had retired as Professor in 
1967, to be replaced by Colin ‘Bunny’ Austin (1914–2004) [62] (Fig. 7). In the 
early 1950s, Bunny, and independently M.C. Chang [45], had discovered the 
requirement for sperm capacitation [63–64], and so Bunny set his graduate 
student, Barry Bavister (1943–), to work to try and resolve how to reliably 
capacitate hamster sperm in vitro. Bavister demonstrated a key role for pH in 
a short paper published in 1969 that showed how higher rates of fertilisation 
could be obtained by simply increasing the alkalinity of the medium [65]. Bob 
seized on this observation and co-opted Barry to his project of capacitating 
human sperm. That proved to do the trick, leading to the 1969 paper [57].
The problem of the intermittent egg supply in the UK was also resolving. 
Bob continued to rely on surgeons to provide him with ovarian biopsies 
from which to mature eggs in vitro, indeed four are thanked in the 1969 
Nature paper. According to Bob [66], Molly Rose provided the first group 
of eggs to be fertilised, and although invited to be a co-author, declined for 
reasons unknown. Also thanked are Norman Morris [67], Janet Bottomley 
and Sanford Markham, and although it is not known whether they provided 
any of the ovarian eggs for in vitro maturation described in the paper, Patrick 
clearly did so [66], and at last provided for Bob a potentially more stable 
clinical partnership.
The 1969 Nature paper describing IVF in humans [57] makes modest 
claims, only two of 56 eggs reaching the two-pronuclear stage. But, like Bob’s 
Figure 7. Bob with Bunny Austin, 1960s 
(courtesy Ruth Edwards).
Edwards_lect_.indd 14 2011-08-29 10:11:01
249
other papers, it is a model of clarity, describing well-controlled experiments, 
cautiously interpreted. This paper convinced where previous claims [68–73] 
had failed, precisely because the skilled hands and creative intellect that lay 
behind it are so evident from its text. With its publication, announced to the 
media on St Valentine’s Day [74], all hell was let loose. 
THE BATTLES BEGIN
So 1969 seemed to Bob to be a good year. Not only did IVF succeed at long 
last, and his partnership with Patrick seemed set to flourish, but also so 
impressed were the Ford Foundation with Bob’s work that they paid for him 
to be awarded a Ford Foundation Readership (a half way step to a professorship) in the University. Elated by his promotion and their achievement, Bob 
and Patrick pressed on, the latter’s laparoscopic skills coming to the fore, 
first in 1970 with the collection of in vivo matured eggs from follicles after 
mild hormonal stimulation [75], and then achieving regular fertilisation of 
these eggs and their early development through cleavage to the blastocyst 
stage [76] – my fifth and sixth landmark papers. So well was the work going 
that in February 1971 they confidently applied to the UK Medical Research 
Council for funding to bring Patrick to Cambridge from Oldham General 
Hospital in Greater Manchester, where Patrick worked [77].
However, any illusions that Bob may have had that their achievements 
would prove a turning point in his fortunes were soon shattered, and just 2 
months later on April Fool’s Day 1971 the MRC decided to reject the grant 
application [77]. The practical consequences of this rejection were profound 
– both psychologically and physically – not least that for the next 7 years, Bob 
shuttled on the 12 hour round trip between Cambridge and Oldham, leaving 
Ruth and his five daughters in Cambridge.
The professional attacks on Bob and his work took a number of forms 
[77], and one must try to make a mental time trip back to the 1960s/70s 
to understand their basis. Despite the nature of the political and religious 
battles to come, his scientific and medical colleagues did not focus on the 
special status of the human embryo as an ethical issue. However, ethical 
issues were raised professionally, but took quite a different form. Thus, it 
is difficult now to comprehend the complete absence of infertility from 
the consciousness of most gynaecologists in the UK at the time, to which 
Patrick Steptoe was a remarkable exception [78]. Indeed, Bob’s strong 
commitment to treating infertility came to the fore only after he teamed up 
with Patrick, his previous priority being the study and prevention of genetic 
and chromosomal disorders. In the several reports from the Royal College 
of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists and the MRC during the 1960s examining the areas of gynaecological ignorance that needed academic attention, 
infertility simply did not feature [77]. Overpopulation and family planning 
were seen as dominant concerns and the infertile were ignored as at best a 
tiny and irrelevant minority and at worst as a positive contribution to population control. This was a values system that Bob simply could not accept,

250
and the many encouraging letters Bob was to receive from infertile couples 
provided a major stimulus to his continued work later, despite so much 
professional and press antagonism and so many set-backs. For his medicoscientific colleagues, however, the fact that infertility was not seen as a clinical 
issue, meant that any research designed to alleviate it was not viewed as 
experimental treatment, but as using humans for experiments. Given the 
sensitivity to Nazi ‘medical experiments’, and the public reaction and 
disquiet surrounding the recent publication of ‘The Human Guinea-pig’ [79], 
this distinction was critical. The MRC, in rejecting the grant application, took 
the position that what was being proposed was human experimentation, and 
so were very cautious, emphasising risks rather than benefits, of which they 
saw few if any [77].
Bob and Patrick were also attacked for their willingness to talk with the 
media. It is even more difficult nowadays, when the public communication of 
science is so embedded institutionally, to understand how damaging to them 
this was. The massive press interest of the late 1960s was unabated in the 
ensuing years, and so Bob was faced with a choice: either he could keep his 
head down and allow press fantasies and speculations to go unanswered and 
unchallenged, or he could engage, educate and debate. For Bob this was no 
choice, regardless of the consequences for him professionally. His egalitarian 
spirit demanded that he trust to common people’s common sense. His radical 
political views demanded that he fought the corner of the infertile, the 
underdog with no voice. The Yorkshireman in him relished engagement in 
the debate and argument. In the seventh landmark paper selected, published 
in Nature in 1971 with Dave Sharpe [80], he acknowledges the risk to his own 
interests of so doing. Risky it clearly was, one of the scientific referees on 
their MRC grant application starting his referee’s report declaring his strong 
distaste for all the media exposure [77]. Bob was a pioneer in the public 
communication of science, and paid a heavy price for being so.
The Edwards and Sharpe paper [80] is a tour de force in its survey of the 
scientific benefits and risks of the science of IVF, in the legal and ethical 
issues raised by IVF, and in the pros and cons of the various regulatory 
responses to them. It sets out the issues succinctly and anticipates social 
responses that were some 13–19 years into the future. In subsequent years, 
Bob built on his strong commitment to social justice based on a social ethic, 
as he engaged at every opportunity with ethicists, lawyers and theologians, 
arguing, playing ‘devil’s advocate’ (literally, in the eyes of some), and engaging 
in what we would now call practical ethics, as he hammered out his position 
and felt able to fully justify his instincts intellectually.

But all this was to little avail. Indeed, Bob was continually frustrated at the 
unwillingness of most of the establishment to engage seriously in ethical 
debates in advance of the final validation of IVF that was to come in 1978 
with the birth of Louise Brown (Fig. 8), and my eighth and final landmark
paper [81]. Only then did most UK social hierarchies, such as the MRC, the 
British Medical Association, the Royal Society and Government move gradually from their almost visceral reactions against IVF and its possibilities to 
serious engagement with the issues [56]. Then, to their credit, both the MRC 
and the Thatcher Government of the time came on board, but it was not 
until 1989, 24 years after Bob’s 1965 landmark paper in the Lancet, that the 
UK Parliament finally gave its stamp of approval to his visionary work, and 
then only after a fierce battle lasting some 11 years [82]. Eleven years since 
the eighth and final landmark paper was published announcing the birth of 
Louise Brown. And of course, it has taken 45 years since that 1965 paper for 
us to be celebrating the award of the Nobel Prize to this remarkable man.

CONCLUSION
The eight landmark papers I have selected (Table 1) present us with a 
man of vision and foresight, imagination and intellectual rigour, and extraordinary energy and drive: witness his prodigious output of papers between 
1954–2008 [83]. A man who could inspire colleagues to tread with him on 
a difficult scientific path besieged by public and professional animosity, of 
whom two in particular, Patrick and Jean, we miss today (Fig. 9). And these 
papers do not even begin to touch Bob’s other academic and personal qualities, so evident in the way he has founded and generously nurtured journals 
and international societies [84, 85], transforming the intellectual landscape 
not just of gynaecology, but also of ethics and social anthropology. Truly the 
‘father of Assisted Reproductive Technology’ in its widest interdisciplinary 
sense: the only sense in which Bob knows it. For Bob, it is truly the Nobel 
Prize for Physiology AND Medicine: there can be no OR about it.
