   During my time in medical school in the 1940’s it was well known that
grafts of organs between individuals of different genetic origin always result
in rejection. Burnett’s hypothesis and Medawar’s experiments began to
shed some light on transplantation immunology and the possibility of toler-
ante (Nobel Laureates, 1960). Inbred mice and human identical twins
appeared to accept grafts from each other. Dr. Murray and his colleagues
were the first to carry out a kidney transplant between human identical
twins, a feat of heroic proportions at the time but now almost routine.
Grafting of bone marrow was an even more remote possibility since marrow
cells could not be sewn into place.
   In 1939, Osgood et al.(l) infused a few ml of marrow into patients with
aplastic anemia without benefit. Rekers et al.(2) worked in the classified
laboratories of the Atomic Energy Commission in Rochester, N. Y. attempt-
ing to reconstitute marrow function in irradiated dogs by marrow infusions.
 These studies were published in 1950. In retrospect, these experiments
 apparently failed because the irradiation exposures, although lethal, were
not great enough to produce the immunosuppression necessary for allogen-
eic engraftment.
   In 1949, Jacobson et al.(3) found that mice could be protected from
otherwise lethal irradiation by shielding the spleen with lead. It was initially
thought that the protective effect was due to humoral stimulants released by
the protected spleen. Soon thereafter Lorenz et al.(4) showed that a similar
protection could be achieved by an intravenous infusion of marrow from a
mouse of the same strain. At that time I was intrigued by these experiments
because of my own work with stimulating factors released by irradiated yeast
(5) and by in vitro studies of marrow metabolism (6,7).
   In 1955, Main and Prehn published a paper showing that mice protected
from lethal irradiation by marrow infusion would accept a skin graft from
the donor strain, an observation strongly suggesting that a transfer of living
donor cells had occurred to account for the apparent tolerance (8). Also in
1955, Ford et al.(9) used cytogenetics to show the presence of donor cells in
irradiated mice protected by a marow infusion. In the summer of 1955 I

moved to the Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital in Cooperstown, N.Y. where I
found that Dr. Joseph Ferrebee had been following these and related
experiments very closely. We decided to begin studies of marrow grafting in
outbred species, especially the canine model, and to begin cautious explora-
tion of marrow infusion in human patients in need of a marrow graft
because of disease or its treatment.
   In 1957, we published our first paper on human marrow grafting which
we called “intravenous infusion” because only one patient had a transient
graft which hardly constituted true marrow transplantation (10). We
learned two things from those studies: 1) Large quantities of human mar-
row could be infused intravenously without harm when properly prepared;
and 2) allogeneic marrow grafting in our species would be very difficult.
Because of concern about irradiation exposure our early funding came
through the Atomic Energy Commission. In the 1957 paper we stated “The
studies presented here show that human bone marrow can be collected and
stored in significant quantities and can be administered with safety. After
administration it may grow even under disadvantageous competitive cir-
cumstances in completely irradiated hosts afflicted with marrow neoplasia.
In an atomic age, with reactor accidents not to mention stupidities with
bombs, somebody is going to get more radiation than is good for him. If
infusion of marrow can induce recovery in a mouse or monkey after lethal
radiation, one had best be prepared with this form of treatment in man. The
leukemic patient who needs radiation and bone marrow and the uremic
patient who needs a spare kidney are people who deserve immediate consid-
eration. From helping them one will be preparing for the atomic disaster of
tomorrow and it is high time one did.” The reference to a spare kidney was
based on the possibility that a marrow graft might be necessary to permit
permanent acceptance of a kidney from the same donor. Immunosuppres-
sive drugs for organ grafting were unknown at that time.
   Allogeneic marrow grafting continued to be unsuccessful, but we did
have the opportunity to carry out marrow grafts between a few sets of
identical twins. Our first two patients, reported in 1959, with refractory
leukemia who had an identical twin were given supralethal irradiation and a
syngeneic marrow infusion (11). Their prompt hematologic recovery and
well being demonstrated that an intravenous infusion of marrow could
 protect against lethal irradiation. The recurrence of their leukemia in a few
months prompted our speculation about how marrow grafting might cure
leukemia as follows: “Evidently something more than radiation is needed to
eradicate leukemia. Two possible approaches are suggested. First, one may
transplant homologous marrow after lethal irradiation and depend on the
homologous marrow to provide an immunologic environment unsuitable
for survival of the leukemia (Barnes et al. 1956). This approach has appar-
 ently eradicated leukemia in some mice (Barnes et al., 1957, Mathé and
 Bernard, 1958). However, these mice subsequently have a high incidence of
death from delayed foreign marrow disease due to a reaction of the graft
against the host. Whether delayed foreign marrow disease will be either

serious or useful in man and whether it can be controlled by clinical
supportive measures available are questions currently being studied.” “The
second approach to the problem of eradicating leukemia lies in the observa-
tion that with chemotherapy and x-ray, the cure rate of transplantable
leukemia in the mouse is an inverse function of the number of cells present
 - the smaller the number of leukemic cells, the greater the possibility of
cure (Burchenal et al., 1951, Mathé et al., 1959). This suggests that the
patient in remission, with a relatively small mass of leukemic cells, is an
advantageous subject for radiation. It further suggests that chemotherapeu-
tic agents may be more effective if administered during an immediate
postradiation period when the number of leukemic cells is relatively small.”
Unfortunately, 15 years were to go by before we were able to carry out
marrow grafts for patients with leukemia in remission.
   During the late 1950’s other investigators attempted allogeneic grafts in
human beings. Mathé and his colleagues reported the Yugoslavian radiation
accident cases in 1959, several of whom were treated with marrow infusions
 (12). A retrospective review of these case suggested little benefit (13). Mathé
did achieve a durable allogeneic marrow graft in a patient with leukemia,.
only to have that patient develop chronic graft-versus-host disease and die
of infectious complications (14).
    Beginning in 1955, Dr. Joseph Ferrebee, Dr. Harry Lochte, Jr. and I and
our colleagues carried out marrow grafting studies in the dog. The dog is a
readily available outbred animal often used in transplantation research and
amenable to clinical procedures comparable to those used for human
patients. When Dr. John Mannick worked with us as a fellow, we found that
dogs could be given three times the lethal dose of total body irradiation and
recover promptly if given an infusion of their own marrow set aside before
irradiation (15). Marrow grafts could be obtained with peripheral blood as
well as marrow (16) and the cells responsible for recovery could be frozen
and kept for long periods of time (17,18).
   However, in the dog as in our human patients marrow from an allogeneic
donor almost always resulted either in failure of engraftment or in success-
ful engraftment followed by lethal graft-versus-host disease (19,20). We
were encouraged by the fact that an occasional dog, usually with a littermate
donor, went through the grafting procedure successfully. The persistence
of donor marrow was confirmed by cytogenetic studies when donor and
recipient were of opposite sex (21) and many of these dogs proved to live a
normal canine life span (22). Evidently it could be done we just had to
find out how.
    Delta Uphoff had reported that methotrexate ameliorated graft-versus-
 host disease in some strains of mice (23). We found methotrexate given post
 grafting to be of help in reducing the incidence and severity of the graft-
 versus-host reaction, and a great deal of work went into the study of various
 methotrexate regimens (20,24). These and other studies in the canine
 model produced a wealth of information, summarized in 1972 (25). Most
importantly, it was clear that a successful allogeneic graft depended upon


close histocompatibility matching between donor and recipient, and we
developed techniques for histocompatibility typing in the dog (26). We were
finally able to detect DL-A antigens and to show that marrow grafts between
matched littermates were almost always successful (27). These studies point-
ed the way for marrow grafting in man using patients with an HL-A
matched sibling donor.
   The many failures of allogeneic marrow grafting in human patients
caused most investigators to abandon such studies in the 1960’s. However,
under the impetus of kidney grafting, the knowledge of human histocompa-
tibility antigens progressed rapidly. As we developed our knowledge of DL-
A matching, we followed closely the work of Dausset (Nobel Laureate,
1980), van Rood, Payne, Bodmer and Amos in the human, the HL-A
system. By 1967, we thought that the time was right to return to allogeneic
marrow grafting in humans. Recognizing that the care of patients with
advanced leukemia undergoing allogeneic grafts would be difficult, we
began to assemble the necessary team. In 1967 we wrote a program project
grant application which was funded by the National Cancer Institute in
1968. We began to assemble and train a team of nurses familiar with the
care of patients without marrow function and subject to opportunistic
infections. In November of 1968 Dr. Robert Good and his colleagues
carried out the first marrow transplant from a matched sibling for an infant
with an immunological deficiency disease (28). Our team carried out our
first transplant using a matched sibling donor for a patient with advanced
leukemia in March 1969.
   These studies marked the beginning of the “modern” era of human
allogeneic marrow grafting. A comprehensive review of the experimental
background, the early clinical successes and the deliniation of problems was
presented in the New England Journal of Medicine in 1975 (29). As follow-
up times increased for patients transplanted for end-stage leukemia, it
became apparent that a plateau was developing on a Kaplan-Meier plot of
survival so that it became possible to use the term “cure” for these patients
(30).
   Allogeneic marrow grafts are now carried out at more than 200 centers
 around the world, and the number of diseases for which marrow grafting
 may be considered continues to increase. Currently, approximately 5,500
allogeneic and 4,000 autologous marrow transplants are performed annual-
ly (Mary Horowitz, International Bone Marrow Transplant Registry, Per-
sonal communication). The longest survivors of these otherwise lethal dis-
eases are now 20 years post-grafting. Recent articles summarize the experi-
ence of the Seattle team with patients given allogeneic marrow grafts for
acute myeloid leukemia (31,32), chronic myeloid leukemia (33,34) and
aplastic anemia and thalassemia major (35). Lucarelli et al. (36) have de-
scribed their extensive experience with thalassemia major.
   Among the early problems in allogeneic marrow grafting, perhaps the
greatest was immunologic reactivity of the host (graft rejection) and/or of
the graft (graft-versus-host disease). Irradiation of the host with “supra-


580                          Physiology or Medicine 1990



lethal” exposures was necessary for retention of the marrow graft. Obvious-
ly, irradiation could not be used after the graft. The use of methotrexate
was mentioned above, but better agents were on the way. Schwartz and
Dameshek (37) noted the immunosuppresive properties of 6-mercaptopur-
 ine and Hitchings and Elion (Nobel laureates, 1988) developed Immuran.
 Santos and Owens introduced cyclophosphamide as an immunosuppressive
 agent for transplantation (38). More recently, cyclosporine has provedinvaluable
 for organ grafts. Cyclosporine was not superior to methotrexate in our
 randomized clinical trials of marrow grafter patients, but the regimen of a
 combination of short methotrexate combined with 6 months of cyclosporine
 proved effective and is now our standard regimen (39,40). Chronic graft-versus-
 host disease is severe in a small fraction of patients, but can sometimes be
 controlled by prolonged corticosteroid therapy (41). T-cell depletion of the
 marrow graft has resulted in a reduced incidence of graft-versus-host dis-
ease but at an increased risk of graft failure or recurrence of malignancy
(42). Newer agents are being investigated.
   Recurrence of malignant disease following an otherwise successful allo-
geneic graft continues to be a problem. Efforts to kill a greater fraction of
the malignant cells have involved a variety of high dose chemotherapy
regimens with or without total body irradiation. Efforts to increase the
intensity of the pre-transplant regimen have been limited by life-threatening
damage to other organs, most notably the liver and lung (43). The role of
biological response modifiers such as interferon is being investigated.
   Because of the graft-versus-host reaction and its treatment, patients are
profoundly immuno-suppressed following an allogeneic marrow graft and
therefore at great risk for all kinds of opportunistic infections (44). Bacte-
rial and some fungal diseases can be controlled by antibiotics, sometimes
with the aid of granulocyte transfusions (45). Prophylactic acyclovir has
prevented Herpes simplex and zoster infections (46). Pneumonia due to
cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been difficult to treat and is a major cause of
death (47). For patient and donor pairs serologically negative for CMV, the
use of blood products from CMV negative donors has prevented infection
(48). The use of prophylactic ganciclovir seems to prevent CMV infection
even when donor and/or recipient are CMV positive. Prevention of CMV
infection should result in an appreciable increment in long-term survivors
of allogeneic marrow grafts.
   Only about one-fourth to one-third of patients will have an HL-A identi-
cal sibling. Examination of the extended family will identify a non-sibling
donor in about 10 percent of patients and results with these donors are
comparable to those with an identical sibling (49). With national and inter-
national cooperation large panels of volunteer donors whose tissue type is
known are now being established. More than 300 transplants using volun-
teer donors matched to the recipient by computer search have now been
carried out. The results using phenotypically matched donors or donors
differing by only one HL-A haplotype seem comparable to matched sibling
donors (50,51).

   In the absence of a suitable matched donor the patient’s own marrow may
be removed, stored and given back after intensive therapy. The general
principles of long-term marrow storage and autologous marrow transplan-
tation have been known for almost 30 years (52). Recently, there has been a
striking increase in the use of autologous marrow grafts as more effective
measures for destruction of the tumor in the patient have been developed.
Methods for destruction of tumor in the marrow graft are being developed.
An autologous graft avoids the problems of graft-versus-host disease but
may be associated with a greater relapse rate due to the loss of the graft-
versus-leukemia effect and the possibility of tumor cells in the stored
marrow.
   Monoclonal antibodies (Köhler and Milstein, Nobel laureates, 1984) are
 being used in many ways in marrow grafting. Anti T-cell antibodies for many
T-cell epitopes are being used in vitro to remove normal or malignant T-
cells from marrow and in vivo to prevent or treat graft-versus-host disease.
Monoclonal antibodies coupled with a toxin are being used to treat graft-
versus-host disease and, coupled to radioactive isotopes, for selective irra-
diation exposure of marrow cavities or of tumors so that exposure of the
total body to irradiation can be reduced.
   Recently, hematopoietic growth factors produced by recombinant molec-
ular biology techniques are being used in marrow grafting. Clinical trials
have shown that G-CSF and GM-CSF can accelerate marrow recovery after
either allogeneic or autologous marrow grafts. Other growth factors are
now entering clinical trial. Biological response modifiers including IL-2, IL-
6, cloned T-cells and interferon are being explored for acceleration of
marrow graft recovery, for better antibacterial and antifungal effects and
greater antitumor effects.
   Progress has been made in the identification and purification of the
hematopoietic stem cell, long a goal of experimental hematologists. Purified
stem cells, free of tumor cells, may be of value in autologous marrow
grafting. Retroviral vectors have increased the efficiency of gene transfer
and purified stem cells are ideal targets for gene transfer therapy for many
diseases. Sustained expression of genes transferred into hematopoietic stem
 cells has not yet been achieved and the application of gene transfer tech-
 nology to diseases such as thalassemia major must await much further
 research.
   In summary, marrow grafting has progressed from a highly experimental
procedure to being accepted as the preferred form of treatment for a wide
variety of diseases at many varying stages of disease. Table 1 shows the
approximate 5 year disease-free survival for the most common diseases
treated by marrow transplantation. Progress has been slow but steady.
Important new developments are showing the way to a further improve-
ment in results so that many more patients with otherwise incurable diseases
will have a reasonable chance of long survival and cure.
   Finally, it should be noted that marrow grafting could not have reached
clinical application without animal research, first in inbred rodents and

then in outbred species, particularly the dog. Application to human patients
depended upon developments in many branches of science including un-
derstanding of the human histocompatibility system, knowledge of immuno-
suppressive drugs, blood transfusion technology, especially the ability to
transfuse platelets, the creation of a repertoire of broad spectrum antibiot-
ics and the development of effective anticancer chemotherapeutic agents. I
echo the sentiments of many previous Nobel laureates when I say that the
success we celebrate today was made possible by the work of many others in
this and in related fields.
