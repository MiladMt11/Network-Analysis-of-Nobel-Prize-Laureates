particular the concentration of calcium ions, which act as a second messen-
ger for many cellular responses like contraction or secretion.
   The neuromuscular junction is often thought of as a prototypical syn-
apse. At the neuromuscular junction the nerve terminal of a motorneurone
releases acetylcholine (ACh) and generates end-plate potentials (EPPs),
which in turn activate voltage sensitive conductances to transmit excitation
into other parts of the muscle fibre (Katz, 1966). The current flow across
the end-plate, induced by the release of packets of ACh, results from the
superposition of many small individual ‘elementary’ events (Katz and Mi-
ledi, 1972) and there is ample evidence that postsynaptic potentials in other
synapses are also generated by the superposition of elementary events.
   This lecture describes the properties of elementary currents underlying
postsynaptic potentials as well as their molecular determinants. The focus is
primarily on the properties of elementary currents mediating neuromuscu-
lar transmission. The neuromuscular junction is the synapse characterized
best, both functionally and in its molecular constituents, and most of the
techniques for recording single channel currents were developed with the
muscle fibre preparation. It has turned out that, apart from important
details, a comparable behaviour of elementary currents is observed for
other transmitter activated postsynaptic potentials, particularly those ‘acti-
vated by glycine, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamate and serotonin.
These transmitters mediate ‘rapid’ synaptic transmission in the central
nervous system (CNS) and produce postsynaptic potentials lasting millisec-
onds to hundreds of milliseconds.


ELEMENTARY        EVENTS

End-plate current noise: The notion of ‘elementary events’ was introduced by
B. Katz and R. Miledi when they observed ‘membrane noise’ during record-
ing of membrane depolarisations induced by ACh applied from a ionto-
phoretic pipette to end-plates of frog skeletal muscle (Katz and Miledi,
 1972). They suggested that the increase in noise associated with depolarisa-
tion is the result of the independent superposition of elementary events
generated by random activation of individual acetylcholine receptors
(AChRs), each activation causing a minute depolarisation.
   The estimates of the size of the conductance change generating an
elementary event derived from such noise measurements, assuming a pulse
shaped conductance change, were of the order of 30 to 50 Picosiemens (pS)
and had a duration of only a few milliseconds (Katz and Miledi, 1972;
Anderson and Stevens, 1973). This means that the amplitude of an elemen-
tary current would be on the order of 3 - 5 Picoamperes (PA). This size is
about two to three orders of magnitude smaller than what could be resolved
by the intracellular recording techniques available at the time (Neher,
1991).
   Current noise in extrasynaptic muscle membrane: ACh sensitivity is restricted,
in normal muscle fibres, to a very small area of the muscle which is located


underneath the nerve terminal. Following chronic denervation of skeletal
muscle, effected by severing the motor nerve, the entire muscle becomes
ACh supersensitive (Axelson and Thesleff, 1959). It is now known that this
is due to the incorporation of newly synthesized ACh receptors into the
extrasynaptic surface membrane of muscle fibres. Using noise analysis of
AC&-activated currents we estimated the average conductance increase
underlying elementary events in denervated frog muscle fibres to be about
20 pS (Neher and Sakmann, 1976a). The size of the elementary current in
denervated fibres was thus smaller (about 60% of normal). The average
duration of the elementary event was however 3 to 5 times longer than that
of elementary events in the end-plate.




ELEMENTARY END-PLATE CURRENTS ARE PULSE SHAPED

Solving the background noise problem: Denervated, supersensitive frog muscle
fibres were thus the preparation of choice for developing methods for
recording from single channels and to investigate the basic properties of ion
channels by direct measurement of elementary events. The key for the
reduction of the background noise in the relevant frequency range (up to 1
kHz) was to restrict the measurement to a small membrane area of about 10
µm2 and to isolate this membrane patch electrically from the rest of the cell
membrane by sealing the narrow tip of the glass pipette tightly onto the
membrane (Neher, 1991). Pressing the pipette against a normal muscle
fibre resulted in seal resistances of less than 1 MΩ and often damaged the
fibre. The sealing problem was solved by exposing the fibre to mild enzy-
matic treatment which freed muscle fibres from their covering connective
tissue and the basement membrane and thus exposing the bare sarcolemma
(Betz and Sakmann, 1973) and by polishing the tip of the pipette with a
small heating filament (Neher, Sakmann and Steinbach, 1978). When the
polished tip of the patch pipette was pressed gently against the bare sarco-
lemmal membrane of single fibres, secured mechanically by a glass hook,
seal resistances of 50 to 150 MΩ were obtained. The membrane potential of
the fibre was set locally, close to the membrane patch from which the patch
current was recorded, by a conventional voltage clamp amplifier with two
intracellular microelectrodes (Fig. 1A).
   Single channel currents: Using these precautions to obtain adequately high
seal resistances (> 50 MΩ) and using suberyldicholine, an agonist causing
ACh receptors to open for longer periods, we were able to record current
blips from denervated frog muscle fibres which were pulse shaped, and
which had many of the hallmarks of the elementary events that had been
inferred from noise analysis of ACh-activated currents (Neher and Sak-
mann, 1976b). Square-pulse shaped currents were also recorded from
denervated rat muscle. They were similar to those obtained from denervat-
ed frog muscle, and in both preparations the directly measured amplitudes
of elementary events agreed reasonably well with the estimated size derived

from fluctuation analysis of ensemble voltage clamp currents (Sakmann,
1978).
   Disjunction of the neuromuscular synapse: To relate the properties of ele-
mentary currents to synaptic transmission at the end-plate of normal muscle
fibres, it was necessary to compare the properties of elementary events with
those of miniature end-plate currents (MEPCs). To place the tip of the
patch pipette onto the end-plate, the neuromuscular junction must be
visible and the nerve terminal, which covers the end-plate in normal fibres,
must be removed from the end-plate. This is most easily accomplished by
localized application of collagenase, followed by a gentle stream of Ringer’s
solution delivered from a pipette with a small (100 pm) tip opening. This
procedure resulted in single muscle fibre preparations with their end-plates
freely accessible (Fig. 1 B).
   Elementary end-plate currents: The elementary events recorded from the
end-plate membrane (elementary end-plate current) were about 50% larger
in amplitude, but considerably shorter in duration than those measured in
rhe extrasynaptic membrane, as expected from the fluctuation analysis of
AC h activated currents in normal and denervated fibres (Neher and Sak-
mann, 1976a). The measurements demonstrated that the elementary end-
plate current is a square pulse-like event allowing passage of small cations
like Na+, K + or Cs+ at a very high rate (107− 108 s-1 , thus suggesting that
these currents reflect the opening an aqueous pore across the membrane
(Neher and Sakmann, 1976b).
   Some basic properties of end-plate channels became apparent only at the
improved resolution that resulted from the reduction of backgromld noise
by establishment of pipette - membrane seals with resistances in the range of
several G Ω (Hamill et al., 198 1). Using freshly pulled pipettes and applying
slight negative pressure to the pipette interior, thereby pulling the patch of
membrane underneath the tip opening into the pipette tip, a molecular
contact between the glass and the plasma membrane was established which
improved the seal resistance from 50 - 150 MΩ to the range of 1 - 100 GΩ.
Consequently, the amplitude of the background noise was reduced and rim
currents (Neher et al., 1978) were almost absent (Fig. 1C). The reduced
background noise allowed us to perform recordings of elementary end-
plate currents with up to 10 kHz bandwidth and to examine quantitatively
the fine details of elementary end-plate currents that became apparent at
this resolution.
   Unitary conductance of the open end-plate channel: Records of elementary
em-plate currents (Fig. 2A) indicated that the end-plate channel exists in
only two conductance states: either the channel is closed, when there is no
agonist occupying the binding site(s) or it is fully open when the binding
site(s) are occupied. The amplitude distribution of a large number of
elementary end-plate currents is fitted by a single (Gaussian curve (Fig. 2B)
where rhe variance in the amplitude distribution is mostly due to the
remaining background noise of the recording. This confirmed the initial
inference that end-plate channels prefer two conductance states, fully
closed and fully open (schematic diagram, Fig. 2A).

Figure 2.   Elementary end-plate currents. A: Trace of elementary end-plate currents from rat
muscle activated by acetylcholine (ACh). Membrane potential was -70 mV. The schematic
drawing under the current trace illustrates the opening and closing of an end-plate channel by
transmitter binding and unbinding to recognition site on the end-plate channel. The channel is
closed in the resting state and is open when two agonist binding sites are occupied by ACh
molecules. B: Distribution of elementary end-plate current amplitudes, activated by 200 nM
ACh in frog muscle. Histogram is fitted by a Gaussian curve with mean of 2. 69 ± 0.10 pA. C:
End-plate channels open rapidly to a unitary conductance. Upper traces show superposition of
leading edges of elementary end-plate current (points) and of record of step-test pulse (continu-
ous line, after amplitude scaling) to measure the frequency response of the recording system.
Relative difference between the two aligned records is shown below (open circles).


   Time course of channel closed-open transitions: The time course of the single
channel current reports structural transitions of a single macromolecule in
real time. An obvious question therefore is whether the time course of the
transition between the open and closed channel states is measurable (Fig.
2C). We superimposed the time course of the leading or trailing edge of a
single channel current on that of the step response of the recording system.
Since no difference was detected the rise time course of single channel
currents must have been limited by the frequency response of the recording
system. The time constant of the channel transition from the closed to the
open states thus is less than 10 ps.
   Observing the same channel repeatedly: To resolve elementary end-plate
currents the concentration of ACh or a related agonist like suberyldicholine
in the pipette, was low (usually below 0. 5 µM) to ensure that the opening of
end-plate channels was infrequent and individual openings were clearly
separated from each other (Fig. 2A). This implied however that one could
not be sure that successive elementary end-plate currents reflect the open-
ing of the same individual end-plate channel, since it is likely that several
channels are present in the membrane patch under investigation. In the
presence of higher agonist concentrations (for acetylcholine > 5 µM) we
found that elementary currents appear in long bursts of several hundreds of
milliseconds duration. The reason for the occurrence of current bursts is
that the channel can adopt, in addition to the ‘resting closed’ state, an
additional, kinetically distinct, closed state designated as ‘desensitized
closed’ state. This state is almost absorbing and channels isomerize only
occasionally back to the open or ‘resting closed’ states. When this happens
the same channel switches back and forth between its ‘resting closed’ and
the ‘open’ state repeatedly before it enters again the desensitized closed
state (Sakmann et al., 1980) thus allowing the observation of several open-
ings and closures of the same individual channel. The fact that the amplitude
of the elementary currents during such an epoch did not change and that
the average durations of end-plate current were essentially independent of
ACh concentration supported the two-state reaction scheme to explain the
current recordings shown in Fig. 2A.


ELEMENTARY STEPS IN NEUROMUSCULAR                     TRANSMISSION

Miniature end-plate currents and elementary end-plate currents: An obvious
question related to the function of the end-plate channel in synaptic trans-
mission is that of the relation between the size and duration of the elemen-
tary end-plate currents and that of the synaptic currents. I n other words,
how is the time course of the end-plate currents related to the gating
properties of the end-plate channel?
   A simple way to reconstruct the decay of a miniature end-plate current
(MEPC), the signal transmitted across the neuromuscular junction follow-
ing the release of a single vesicle of transmitter, is to align several hundreds
or thousands of elementary end-plate currents at their leading edge and

superimpose them. The hypothesis behind this procedure is that, following
the release from a presynaptic vesicle, the concentration of ACh in the
synaptic cleft rises very rapidly (in less than 1 ms) to saturate ACh receptors,
and then rapidly decays again to negligible values (Magleby and Stevens,
1972). If the ACh concentration transient in the cleft is very brief in
comparison to the average duration of elementary end-plate currents then
the decay of MEPCs would reflect the distribution of the durations of
elementary end-plate currents after removal of ACh. In Fig. 3 individual

elementary end-plate currents are aligned at their leading edges (Fig. 3A).
The current generated by superposition of 1000 elementary end-plate
currents has a peak of 4.7 nA and decays with a time constant of 2. 7 ms
(Fig. 3B). These values are similar to those of MEPCs recorded from rat
muscle end-plates. This suggests that a single MEPC, which reflects a
quanta1 conductance increase of approximately 50 nS, is generated by the
almost simultaneous opening of about one thousand end-plate channels
(each with 50 pS conductance), and that the decay of MEPCs is determined
to a first approximation, by the average duration of the elementary end-
plate currents.
   Elementary currents reflect bursts of single channel openings: The time course
of elementary end-plate currents is more complicated in shape than expect-
ed from a channel that switches between an open and a single closed state as
assumed in Fig. 2A. Most elementary end-plate currents, when examined at
high time resolution, are interrupted by very short gaps (Fig. 4A, B), i. e. the
current returns transiently to the base line (Colquhoun and Sakmann, 198 1;
Colquhoun and Sakmann, 1985). This behaviour is observed in almost all
transmitter- and voltage-gated ion channels investigated so far. In the case
of the end-plate channel, it reflects the fact that, when the receptor has
bound ACh, the channel opens and closes several times before the agonist
dissociates from the receptor. The scheme shown in Fig. 2A is intended only
to illustrate the basic principle of structural transitions of the channel and
assumes only one open and one closed channel state. In reality, however, a
reaction scheme consistent with the experimental observations involves
several closed and open states. The observed behaviour of the current
during a single elementary event is in fact predicted by a reaction involving
transition of the closed, resting receptor to the open state via an intermedi-
ate closed state (Colquhoun and Hawkes, 1977).
   Plausible reaction scheme for end-plate channel activation: We investigated the
fine structure of these brief transitions for end-plate channels in collabora-
tion with D. Colquhoun. Using the tools of probability theory (Colquhoun
and Hawkes, 1982), it was possible to derive the minimum number of states
the channel can adopt and also the rates of transition from one state to
another (Colquhoun and Sakmann, 1985). At least five kinetically distinct
states (Fig. 4C) could be discriminated from the measurement of both the
open and closed time distributions at low concentrations of several agonists,
and the derived reaction rates satisfactorily described the time interval
distributions. It represents a scheme for the gating of the end-plate channel
by ACh during normal neuromuscular transmission and is a modification of
the scheme proposed initially by Del Castillo and Katz (1957). It comprises a
resting, unliganded state and four liganded states two of which are open
states. The derived microscopic rate constants (Fig. 4D), which describe the
transitions between the various states of the end-plate channel, indicate that
the open probability of the channel at high the ACh concentrations occur-
ring during neuromuscular transmission (higher than 100 µM) is close to
unity. This implies that ACh acts on the end-plate channel as a transmitter

dominates (Sakmann and Brenner, 1978 ; Michler and Sakmann, 1980). The
molecular basis for this difference in synaptic currents is shown in Fig. 5.
Two classes of elementary currents are recorded from muscle fibres at early
postnatal stages. Mammalian skeletal muscle expresses two isoforms of end-
plate channels which mediate different elementary end-plate currents (Ha-
mill and Sakmann, 1981), differing both in amplitude and average duration.
The expression of these channel isoforms is developmentally regulated. At
early stages of development, in the uninnervated muscle, a fetal type of
channel with lower conductance and longer average durations of elemen-
tary currents predominates. Following innervation the fetal isoform is re-
placed by the mature adult isoform which has a higher conductance and a
shorter duration of elementary currents. Following denervation the fetal
isoform is expressed again, suggesting that skeletal muscle expresses a
mosaic of AChR channel isoforms and that the composition of this mixture
of channel isoforms is under neuronal control (Sakmann et al., 1992 for
review).


MOLECULAR DETERMINANTS OF CHANNEL FUNCTION

Identification of some of the molecular determinants of AChR channel
function was achieved using patch clamp techniques and the tools of molec-
ular biology. Biochemical work on Torfedo electroplax had shown that the
AChR channel is assembled in a pseudosymmetric fashion from several
subunits where each subunit contributes to the formation of the channel
(Karlin, 1991; for review). In addition, it had been demonstrated that
recombinant AChR channels can be reconstituted in a functional form in a
host membrane by injecting the RNAs, that encode constituent subunits,


into the cytoplasm of Xenopus laevis oocytes (Miledi et al., 1989, for review).
Following the isolation of the genes encoding the subunits of T o r p e d o
electroplax and skeletal muscle AChRs, in vitro synthesized RNAs could be
used to direct the synthesis of wild type and mutagenized recombinant
AChR channels (Numa, 1989, for review). Whole-cell current measure-
ments from oocytes, expressing recombinant AChR channels, though im-
portant in showing that only certain subunit combinations would assemble
to functional AChR channels, lacked the detail necessary to demonstrate
the similarity of recombinant and native AChRs or to draw conclusions on
more specific structure-function relations. To relate functional properties
of native AChRs to structural data single channel conductance measure-
ments on recombinant AChRs were required.
   Because the oocyte plasma membrane is ensheathed by a vitelline mem-
brane the access of patch pipette tips to the plasma membrane is prevented.
The vitelline layer may be removed and the bare oocyte membrane ex-
pressed without damaging it, by brief exposure of the oocyte to a strongly
hypertonic potassium solution. Oocytes then shrink away from the covering
vitelline layer, which can be mechanically removed, leaving the bare plasma
membrane (Methfessel et al., 1986). This procedure enabled us to combine
single channel conductance measurements with recombinant DNA tech-
niques to identify structural determinants of AChR channel function. Two
problems which are closely interrelated, the elucidation of the molecular
basis of end-plate channel isoforms and the identification of structural
determinants of the channels inner wall, were resolved in collaboration with
a group of molecular biologists from the laboratory of S. Numa and with V.
Witzemann.
   Recombinant AChR channel subtypes: The molecular distinction between the
two isoforms of the end-plate channel (Fig. 5) was clarified as a result of
experiments where the cRNAs of the five muscle subunits were injected into
oorytes, resulting in the functional expression of two AChR isoforms.
Following the injection of cRNAs encoding the α-, β-, γ- and δ - or alternati-
vely the α-, β-, δ- and ε-subunits two functionally different recombinant
channel isoforms were generated (Fig. 6A, B). In their functional properties
the two recombinant AChR isoforms resembled closely the two native
AChR isoforms observed in muscle membrane (Mishina et al., 1986). Both
the amplitude of single channel currents recorded from oocytes and their
average duration (Fig. 6C) were similar to elementary currents observed in
bovine or rat skeletal muscle (Mishina et al., 1986; Witzemann et al., 1987;
Witzemann et al., 1990). Thus, it seems that native channel isoforms reflect
differences in subunit composition of the channel, in the case of AChR
channel an exchange between the γ- and ε-subunit is the molecular differ-
ence between the two channel subtypes (Fig. 6D, E).
   Differential regulation of γ- and ε-subunit genes: The molecular mechanism
underlying the switch in end-plate channel properties effected by the ex-
change of constituting subunits is a postnatal switch in the expression of the
genes encoding the γ - and ε-subunit. Northern blot analysis of total RNAs

from muscle at different postnatal ages show that a reciprocal change in the
level of γ- and ε-subunit specific mRNAs occurs during postnatal develop-
ment (Witzemann et al., 1989; Witzemann et al., 1991). This differential
regulation depends on differences in the regulatory sequences of the γ− and
ε-subunit genes and their different responsiveness to neural and myogenic
factors (Witzemann et al., 1990; Numberger et al., 1991; Witzemann and
Sakmann, 1991). Since in most cells, including neurones, channel isoforms
are expressed which often are colocalized in a mosaic-like manner, the


regulation of the abundance of channel isoforms by differential expression
of subunit genes may be one mechanism by which long-term (‘plastic’)
changes in chemical and electrical excitability can occur (Sakmann et al.,
 1992, for review).
     Molecular determinants of ion transport: The work of Hille and coworkers
(Hille, 1984) had indicated that the end-plate channel is a cation-selective
pore with a channel constriction of about 6 Å in diameter. The first insight
into the molecular determinants of ion transport of the AChR was obtained
following the identification of sequence domains in each subunit that may
participate in forming the wall of the channel. Conventional whole-cell
current measurements from Xenopus oocytes, coinjected with wild type and
mutagenized AChR subunit-specific cRNAs, gave only inconclusive results
with respect to the involvement of particular subunit domains (Mishina et
al., 1985). Subunit specific differences in gating and conductance of various
channel isoforms were however detected by single channel conductance
measurements from isolated membrane patches where the ion composition
and concentration on both membrane faces could be varied (Hamill et al.,
 1981). These advantages were exploited to localize functionally important
domains in AChR subunits.
      Hybrid channels and chimaeric subunits: The gating and conductance of
recombinant AChR channels assembled from homologous subunits of dif-
ferent species like Torpedo californica     and calf (bos taurus ) depends on the
particular combination of subunit cRNAs coinjected (Sakmann et al., 1985).
 The δ-subunits of bovine muscle and of Torpedo electroplax AChR confer
slightly different conductances to the hybrid channels when assembled
together with α-, β- and γ-subunits of either species (Imoto et al., 1986).
This observation was exploited to construct various chimaeric subunits from
bovine and Torpedo AChR δ-subunits (Fig. 7A, R). Conductance measure-
ments of the recombinant channels carrying different chimaeric δ-subunits
(Fig. 7C) identified a domain designated as the M2 transmembrane segment
to be important for conferring differences in conductance (Imoto et al.,
1986). The most conspicuous difference in the aligned amino acid se-
quences was in the number of charged amino acids in the extracellular bend
bordering the M2 segment (Fig. 7D).
 The channels mouths and wall probed by conductance meusuremmts of mutant
channels: To precisely locate those amino acids important for ion transport
and selectivity we investigated the effect of point mutations in the M2
transmembrane segment and the adjacent bends on conductances of mu-
tant channels. Four amino acid positions, homologous in each subunit, were
identified where amino acids are localized which are important for cation
transport through the open channel and for its selectivity between monova-
lent cations.
   Anionic rings: The M2 transmembrane regions, identified by mapping
with chimaeric δ-subunits, show a conspicuous clustering of charged amino
acids bordering the M2 transmembrane segment in each of the subunits
(Fig. 8A). By introducing point mutations at these positions, which changed

the charge of the amino acid side chains, we found that largely the net
number of negative charges, irrespective in which subunit the mutation was
introduced, determines the channel conductance. This suggested that the
charged amino acids of the constituting subunits present in the bends
bordering the M2 segment (Fig. 8A) are forming three ring-like structures
at the channels extra- and intracellular mouths, respectively (Imoto et al.,
1988; Konno et al., 1991).
    Channel constriction: To localize positions where amino acid side chains are
forming the channel wall and in particular those amino acids that form the
the narrow portion of the channel, we investigated the functional proper-
ties of recombinant AChR channels mutagenized within the M2 transmem-
brane segment. The narrow portion is often referred to as the channels
‘selectivity filter’ suggesting that here the interaction of transported ion,
and their water shells, with the channels inner wall determines which ions
may pass and which may not (Hille, 1984, for review). To map amino acids
which could be involved in this interaction, conductances of mutant chan-
nels for different cations of different size and mobility were measured (Fig.
8B). These measurements indicated that a major determinant of ion selec-
tivity resides in the residues located in M2 at a position close to the position

of amino acids forming the 'intermediate' anionic ring (Fig. 8A). The
channel conductance is altered by introducing amino acids of different side
chain volume at this position. Side chains like valine that have larger
volumes reduce the conductance, while side chains with smaller volumes
increase the conductance (Villarroel et al., 1991). The effect of these point
mutations depends on the size and mobility of the ion used to measure the
c o n d u c t a n c e ( F i g . 8C), the effects being larger for Cs+ than for Na+
(Villarroel and Sakmann, 1992).
   A simple model of the AChR selectivity filter: Single channel conductance
measurements on hybrid AChR channels carrying chimaeric subunits thus
identified the M2 transmembrane segment as one determinant contributing
to the formation of the channels’ inner wall. Point mutational analysis
refined the mapping and identified four positions in each subunit where
amino acid side chains are likely to interact with permeating cations. A
working hypothesis would be to assume that cations accumulate at the
channels’ extra- and intracellular mouths because of electrostatic attraction
via the negative charges provided by the three anionic rings, whereas anions
are excluded because of electrostatic repulsion. The selection between
monovalent cations is predominantly due to sieving in the channels constric-
tion, which is formed by amino acids contributing hydroxyl-containing side
chains.


ION CHANNELS MEDIATING RAPID SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION
BETWEEN NEURONES

Synapses in the central nervous system (CNS) operate using transmitters
which are different from those in peripheral synapses, the most common
ones being glycine, GABA, glutamate and serotonin. Moreover CNS-synap-
ses fall into two categories, either excitatory or inhibitory. The work of
Eccles and his collaborators (Eccles, 1963) showed that synaptic communi-
cation in the CNS, as in the periphery, is mediated by ionic currents that
flow across the postsynaptic membrane, generating excitatory or inhibitory
postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs and IPSPs). Depending on which ions carry
the postsynaptic currents, the respective transmitters are classified as exci-
tatory or inhibitory. Glutamate, serotonin and ACh activate cation currents,
carried mostly by Na+ and K+ and to a smaller extent by Ca2+ under
physiological conditions, whereas GABA and glycine activate anion cur-
rents, carried under physiological conditions by Cl-. To characterize the
elementary currents underlying postsynaptic potentials in the CNS we
initially used isolated neurones obtained from fetal brain, maintained in
culture conditions, which express receptor channels activated by CNS trans-
mitters.
   Elementary currents activated by glycine and GABA: An important feature of
signal integration in the CNS is the occurrence of postsynaptic inhibition
between neurones. This occurs when the electrical activity of a neurone is
reduced by IPSPs, which are largely mediated by the transmitters glycine or


GABA, which cause an increase in the permeability of the postsynaptic cell
to chloride ions. To find out whether ion channels mediate this increase in
Cl- conductance we measured the elementary currents activated by glycine
or GABA in neurones isolated from fetal spinal cord and brain. They were
freed from their extracellular coats during the isolation procedure and
readily allow the sealing of a pipette tip onto their plasma membrane (Fig.
9A).
   For the characterisation of the ionic requirements of currents and phar-
macology activated by inhibitory transmitters the ‘whole-cell’ recording
configuration (Fig. 9B) was used, thus allowing the current through the
entire cell membrane to be monitored. Fig. 9C illustrates the activation of
membrane current of hundreds of pA in a spinal neurone in response to the
application of glycine. The current trace becomes “noisy” during glycine
activated current, but elementary currents are not resolvable. Following
isolation of an ‘outside-out’ patch (Fig. 9D) the application of glycine at the
same concentration activates a much smaller average current, of only a few
pA. The superposition of pulse-shaped elementary currents is now clearly
detectable (Fig. 9E), suggesting that glycine activated whole-cell currents
are generated by the superposition of elementary currents of unitary ampli-
tude and varying duration. The size of glycine-activated elementary currents
is in the same range as that of elementary end-plate currents, indicating that
CNS transmitters also act by opening ion channels.
   Conctivation of ClyR and GARAR channels: Most neurones isolated from
fetal CNS have both glycine and GABA activated whole-cell currents which
are carried by Cl-. The respective ion channels (GlyR- and GABAR-chan-
nels) were often co-localized in the same membrane patch (Fig. 10A) and
their properties were studied by recording single channel currents.
   The GlyR and GABAR-channels are different molecular entities (Betz,
 1990) which share many functional properties. By measuring the reversal
potentials in bi-ionic conditions using different permeant inorganic and
organic anions the diameter of the narrow region of GlyR and GABAR
channels was found to be between 4.8 and 5.4 Α at its constriction (Bor-
mann et al., 1987). This is comparable to the size of the constriction of the
end-plate channel (Hille 1984, for review). The results suggest, in conjunc-
tion with structural information obtained from the elucidation of the amino
acid sequences of the constituting GlyR and GABAR subunits, that trans-
mitter gated channels are operating according to common principles, possi-
bly being derived from common evolutionary ancestors (Betz, 1990, for
review).
   Conductance substates of channels activated by CNS transmitters: The elemen-
tary currents activated by glycine or GABA are pulse shaped events, but in
contrast to what we had expected initially, both transmitters opened chan-
nels which may adopt several conductance states. Several of these substates
are common to both channels, however the most frequently occurring
“main” conductance states are different (Hamill et al., 1983; Bormann et
al., 1987). Glutamate, the major excitatory transmitter in the CNS, also

sis of recombinant channels indicate that the receptor channels gated by the
major CNS transmitters, GABA, glycine and glutamate can show a wide
functional diversity. This probably occurs due to the expression of numer-
ous subunits, which may form both homo- as well as heterooligomeric
isoforms of channels with subunit-specific properties (Verdoorn et al.,
1990). A possible, but so far unproven hypothesis would be that channel
subtypes are co-localized in the postsynaptic membrane in a mosaic-like
fashion; this may be a prerequisite for the alteration of synaptic efIicacy by
changes in the composition of isoforms of the receptor mosaic.


POSTSYNAPTIC CURRENTS IN BRAIN SLICES

It is important to characterize those receptor channel isoforms that actually
mediate postsynaptic potentials in neurones of clearly defined pathways in
the intact CNS. In culture the cellular identity of isolated neurones is rather
ill-defined, and these neurones lack their natural neighbours with which
they form specific synapses. Therefore, the brain slice technique, pioneered
by P. Andersen, was modified to perform whole-cell and single channel
current measurements from neurones in suit, to characterize the quanta]
conductance changes generating EPSPs and IPSPs and the elementary
currents underlying them.
      Sealing patch pipettes., onto new-ones in brain slires: The procedure that
allowed us to use patch pipettes for whole-cell and single channel conduc-
tance measurements on neurones in brain slices consisted of a modification
of the procedure developed for exposing the end-plates of single skeletal
muscle fibres. Initially we used local application of collagenase; however, we
found later that a gentle stream of extracellular solution, directed towards
the surface of the slice (Fig. 11 A), was sufIicient to expose the cell body of
visually identified neurones (Fig. 11 B, C) in almost any part of the brain or
spinal cord for recording with patch pipettes (Edwards et al., 1989).
    Quantal transmission in CNS synapses: Recording of stimulus-evoked IPSCs
from granule cells of the dentate gyrus, as well as recording of elementary
currents from outside-out patches, demonstrated the quanta1 n a t u r e o f
IPSCs mediated by GABA, and showed that the size of the conductance
change occurring during a quanta1 IPSCs is relatively small (in the order of
 100 - 200 pS ). This suggested that only a small number of postsynaptic
GABAR channels (20 to 40) are activated by the release of a quantum of
transmitter. Based on results from modelling the size and time course of
IPSCs it appears that the small number of activatable GABAR-channels
under a single synaptic houton is the major determinant of this small
quanta1 conductance change ( Sakmann et al., 1989; Edwards et al., 1990 ;
Busch and Sakmann, 1991).

by glutamate acting on postsynaptic glutamate receptor (GluR) channels of
the AMPA subtype (Jonas and Sakmann, 1992; Stern et al., 1992). EPSCs
are also characterized by a small quanta1 conductance change, in the order
of 100 - 200 pS (Fig. 12B), which most likely also reflects a small number of
activated channels.
   Gating of GluR channels in CNS synapses: In central synapses the time
course of the changes in transmitter concentration following axonal release
is not known, nor is the density or the kinetic properties of the receptor
channels. If the transmitter disappears rapidly from the synaptic cleft, the
decay of EPSCs or IPSCs would reflect the distribution of elementary
current durations after removal of the transmitter. Alternatively, the decay
could reflect desensitization of postsynaptic receptors in the presence of a
sustained level of transmitter in the synaptic cleft. To measure the gating

excitatory synapses on stellate cells (Stern et al., 1992), suggesting that, at
least in these cells, the decay of the fast EPSCs reflects predominantly the
closure of GluR channels from the open to the resting closed state following
rapid removal of transmitter from the synaptic cleft. This implies that
glutamate is present only very briefly in the synaptic cleft (less than 1 ms)
and that EPSCs are mediated by a GluR channel subtype characterized by
short average duration of elementary currents. In spite of this some desen-
sitisation of GluR channels may still occur, even during a single EPSC
(Trussell and Fischbach, 1989).

occurrence of functional GluR channel subtypes which mediates rapid
synaptic currents is based on the assembly of native channels from different

bly, we collaborated with P. Seeburg and compared functional properties of
native and recombinant GluR channels. Recombinant GluR channels were
assembled from different subunits of the AMPA receptor subunit family
(Hollmann et al., 1989; Keinanen et al., 1990) guided by the pattern of
subunit genes which are co-expressed in different parts of the brain (Som-
mer et al., 1990).
   Comparison of functional properties of recombinant homomeric and
heteromeric GluR channels suggested that properties like rectification of
channel conductance and divalent permeability are dominated by the pres-
ence of a particular (GluR-B) subunit in native GluR channels (Hollmann et
al., 1991, Verdoorn et al.,1991). This dominance was traced to a single
amino acid in the putative M2 transmembrane segment (Verdoorn et al.,
1991; Hume et al., 1991; Bumashev et al., 1992). The almost ubiquitous
expression of the GluR-B subunit gene in CNS is likely to confer the
conductance properties and the low Ca++ permeability of native GluR
channels mediating fast EPSCs. Its differential expression is likely to deter-
mine differences in Ca++ + permeability of native GluR channels in different
cell types, for example of the cerebellum (Khodorova and Burnashev,
1992). In addition to differential expression of the GluR-B subunit gene an
additional mechanism seems to operate in regulating the properties of
native GluR channel isoforms. The GluR-B subunit is found in two isoforms
differing only by a single amino acid in the M2 transmembrane segment
(Fig. 14A-C). The two subunit isoforms confer different conductance prop-
erties to heteromeric channels. The difference is most likely due to editing
of the GluR-B subunit specific mRNA (Sommer et al., 1991).


OUTLOOK

Patch clamp techniques are now well established and routinely applied in
combination with other techniques like recombinant DNA or fluorimetric
techniques to characterize molecular details of the events underlying synap-
tic signalling between cells. Through the measurement of elementary cur-
rents the biophysical interpretation of the electrical signals which underlie
rapid cellular communication across synapses has been simplified and can
be partly understood in molecular terms. At the same time single channel
conductance measurements have provided evidence for numerous isoforms
of receptor channels, as well as voltage and second messenger gated chan-
nels particularly in CNS neurones. The significance of this remains to be
elucidated with respect to synaptic communication in the CNS. It seems
that the characterisation of the various types of ligand and voltage gated ion
channels on the extensive dendritic trees of CNS neurones is necessary for
an understanding of their integrative function, i. e. the generation of
patterns of electrical activity resulting from IPSPs and EPSPs from many
synaptic inputs. Equally important will be the characterisation of the ion
channels responsible for the electrical activity of nerve terminals. Patch
pipettes could provide the resolution necessary to study the electrical

signals in nerve terminals and dendrites. This seems to be a prerequisite if
one wishes to understand how changes in synaptic transmission may contri-
bute to changes in functional connectivity of neuronal pathways, during
normal and pathological states.
