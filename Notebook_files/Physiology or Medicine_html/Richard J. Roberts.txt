Much of my work in biology has been driven by my early training in
chemistry. When studying a new chemical compound, the first and most
important thing is to determine its detailed molecular structure. For a
molecular biologist that usually means determining some DNA sequence,
since an accurate knowledge of sequence will then allow the proper design
of experiments to examine function. I was first exposed to the idea of
macro-molecular sequences while I wa s a postdoctoral fellow with Jack
Strominger at Harvard. During that time I briefly visited Fred Sanger’s
laboratory in Cambridge, England to learn the methodology of RNA finger-
printing and sequencing.
   Shortly before moving to Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, I learnt of
restriction enzymes from a lecture by Dan Nathans and immediately decid-
ed that here was the key to DNA sequencing. The idea was that by mapping
restriction sites and sequencing small fragments, longer gene-size sequences
could be put together. My laboratory set out to isolate and characterize as
many restriction enzymes as possible (Roberts, 1976). We began to use
these enzymes to map Adenovirus-2 DNA (Mulder et al., 1974) and to
identify small fragments that might be worth sequencing. One such frag-
ment would contain the 5’-end of an Adenovirus-2 mRNA and the eukaryo-
tic promoter that controlled its expression. It was the hunt for this promot-
er-containing fragment that led to our discovery of split genes and RNA
splicing (Gelinas and Roberts, 1977; Chow et al., 1977; Gelinas et al., 1977;
Broker et al., 1978). By this time, Fred Sanger and Walter Gilbert had
developed DNA sequencing methods and we f occused our attention on the
sequence requirements for RNA splicing. Joe Sambrook, Walter Keller and
others cloned the tripartite leader that was present on Adenovirus-2 late
mRNAs and Sayeeda Zain determined its sequence (Zain et al., 1979). Soon
we undertook the complete sequence of the Adenovirus-2 genome, which
was eventually finished as a collaborative effort with Ulf Pettersson’s labora-
tory (Roberts et al., 1986).
   We realized early on that computational help would be essential for the
sequencing project and we developed many programs for assembling and

analyzing DNA sequences (Gingeras et al., 1978; 1979; 1982; Gingeras and
Roberts, 1980; Blumenthal et al., 1982; Keller et al., 1984). During this
time we and others began to clone and sequence the genes for restriction
enzymes and their companion methyltransferases (MTases) (Kiss et al.,
1985; Bhagwat et al., 1986). Our initial naive assumption was that in any
given restriction-modification system there would be a common region in
the protein sequence of the restriction enzyme and the MTase that would
pinpoint the region responsible for DNA sequence recognition. This was
based on the fact that both enzymes had to recognize exactly the same DNA
sequence. Once this common protein sequence had been recognized, we
thought it likely that in vitro manipulation would allow us to change the
DNA sequence recognized and so create new restriction enzymes by protein
engineering. This proved hopelessly naive. Not only was there no similarity
between the sequences for restriction enzyme and MTase genes, there was
                                                                         .
also no similarity between the genes for different restriction enzymes There
was, however, considerable sequence similarity among the genes for
MTases, it being especially strong for the enzymes forming 5-methylcyto-
sine. This observation has shaped the last few years of my research efforts
and has led to our latest discovery, which is the topic of this lecture.
   Methylation of adenine and cytosine residues is commonly found in
prokaryotes and cytosine methylation is widespread in eukaryotes. In bacte-
ria, DNA methylation serves as a component of restriction-modification
systems (Roberts an d Halford , 1993) and also as part of mismatch repair
systems (Modrich, 1991). In higher eukaryotes, methylation of cytosine
residues appears to be essential (Li et al., 1992) and is involved in the
control of gene expression, developmental regulation, genomic imprinting
and X-chromosome inactivatio n (Jost and Saluz, 1993).
   There are three kinds of methylation that bacteria use to protect their
DNA against the action of restriction enzymes 5-methylcytosine
                                                 :                   (m5C), N4-
methylcytosin e (m4C), and N6-methyladenie (m6A). To date, 50 different
m5C-MTase genes have been sequenced (Kumar et al., 1994). When we first
began comparing the sequences of these genes in 1987, the available
computer software was unable to provide good alignments of many of these
sequences because the similarity between them was limited to short patches,
which we now call motifs, that were separated by quite dissimilar regions.
The similarity could be detected by eye however. Janos Posfai in my labora-
tory began developing algorithms that could find these small patches of
similarity among proteins (Posfai et al., 1989). The program searched for
the presence of small triplet patterns (Figure 1) and then combined them
into motifs that represented well-conserved regions within each of the set of
proteins being aligned. These motifs then anchored the initial alignment. By
 reducing the stringency of the triplet search and limiting it to the regions
 between the main motifs, weaker motifs could be found, enabling a more
 complete alignment . Finally, gaps could be introduced to complete the
 alignment. We have since refined these programs and included a user
 interface with graphic output that enables the overall architecture of a

(20 X 20 X 20 = 8,000 combinations). All sequences to be aligned are searched for the presence

 group of proteins to be visualized. A schematic illustrating the relationships
 among the m5C-MTases is shown in Figure 2. There are six regions of
 strong similarity and four more regions of lesser similarity that can be used
 to anchor the alignments between these sequences. Connecting these motifs
 are regions that vary in length and sequence. Similar analyses of the m5C- ,
 MTases have been reported by others (Lauster et al., 1989).
   Among the six well-conserved motifs, two could be assigned functional
significance. Motif IV, which is shown in block form in Figure 3A, contains
a cysteine residue that was postulated by Dan Santi to be a key catalytic
residue (Santi and Danenberg, 1984). Santi had proposed that an initial step
in the reaction involved the formation of a covalent complex between this
cysteine residue in the MTase and the 6-position of cytosine in a Michael
reaction. This activates the 5-position of cytosine and permits transfer of
the methyl group from the cofactor S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). The
proposed reaction pathway is shown in Figure 3B. Much biochemical evi-
dence was available to support this mechanism, including the important
observation that 5-fluorocytosine was a mechanism-based inhibitor (Wu and
Santi, 1987). Later work has enabled the isolation of the covalent intermedi-
ate (Chen et al., 1991; Friedman and Ansari, 1992; Smith et al., 1992) and
the cysteine within motif IV has been shown directly to be the site of
covalent bond formation (Chen et al., 1991). Recent experiments have
shown that mutation of this cysteine residue to glycine, serine or other

   Although most of the known m5C-MTases are mono-specific, that is they
recognize a single sequence, some MTases are known that recognize more
than one specific sequence. These are the so-called “multi-specific” MTases
that are encoded by several Bacillus bacteriophages. These enzymes are
single polypeptides like the monospeciftc enzymes, but have the unusual
property of methylating several quite different sequences. One example is
M.Φ3TI, which recognizes and methylates GGCC and GCNGC (Noyer-
Weidner et al., 1983). It is included in Figure 2 from which it can be seen
that its variable region is extraordinarily long. A series of elegant studies
carried out in Tom Trautner’s laboratory has showed convincingly that
single mutations within the variable regions of M.Φ3TI and other multi-
specific MTases knock out the ability of the enzyme to recognize one of the
specific sequences, while still allowing the others to be recognized (Balgan-
esh et al., 1987; Wilke et al., 1988). In the case of the mono-specific
MTases, a comparable experiment was not possible, since mutations that
prevented DNA recognition would also block MTase activity. Saulius Klima-
sauskas and Janise Nelson in my laboratory undertook a series of domain
swap qxperiments between two of the mono-specific MTases (Klimasauskas
et al., 1991). We chose M.HpaII (recognition sequence: CmCGG) and
M.HhaI (recognition sequence: GmCGG) because they both recognize te-
tranucleotide sequences and the base methylated is located at an equivalent
position within the recognition sequences. The variable regions, with or
without flanking sequences, were swapped as illustrated in Figure 5. In
several cases, active MTases resulted and comparison of the hybrids showed
clearly that sequence speciftcity lay entirely within the variable region.
Surprisingly, hybrids in which the variable region plus its adjacent motif IX
were transferred showed much higher methylation activity than hybrids in
which just the variable region had been swapped.
   In another series of domain swap experiments, Mi Sha swapped the
variable regions from M.HpaII and M.MspI. These enzymes both recognize
the sequence, CCGG, but M.MspI transfers the methyl group to the first
cytosine residue in the sequence (Walder et al., 1983) whereas M.HpaII
transfers the group to the second cytosine residue (Mann and Smith, 1979).
The results of these experiments showed that the choice of base to be
methylated also depends upon the variable region (Mi and Roberts, 1992).
   While pursuing our studies of the biochemistry and molecular biology of
MTases, it became apparent that a crystal structure would be essential if we
were to understand fully the reaction mechanism. Ashok Dubey, in my lab,
began a collaboration with Xiaodong Cheng, working in Jim Pflugrath’s
laboratory at Cold Spring Harbor. They purified and attempted to crystal-
lize M.MspI, which we had studied extensively (Lin et al., 1989; Dubey et al.,
 1992; Dubey and Roberts, 1992). Later they tried to crystallize M.HpaII, on
which we had also worked (Card et al., 1990). In both cases, the efforts were
unsuccessful. However, our third attempt, using M.HhaI was quite success-
ful. This enzyme forms part of the HhaI restriction system from Haemophilus
huemolyticus, which had been discovered in my laboratory (Roberts et al.,

1976). If is one of the smallest of the m5C-MTases, containing 327 amino
acids (M, 37 Kd). Its gene has been cloned and sequenced (Caserta et al.,
1987) and the protein was overexpressed in E. coli (Wu and Santi, 1988;
Klimasauskas et al., 1991) and subjected to detailed kinetic studies (Wu and
Santi, 1987). Sanjay Kumar purified the enzyme and, in December 1991, it
crystallized readily - a wonderful Christmas present! Within 11 months
Xiadong Cheng had a structure for the binary complex between M.HhaI
and AdoMet at 2.5 Å resolution (Cheng et al., 1993).
  The structure was most revealing (Figure 6), being composed of a large
domain and a small domain forming a cleft that appeared ideal to accomo-
date a DNA helix. Motif I (FGG) was confirmed to be involved in AdoMet
binding, while another of the conserved motifs, X (GN), was also implicated
in AdoMet binding. Motif IV (PC) was positioned close to the AdoMet-
binding site on the same side of the cleft. Motif VIII (QRR) lay at the base of
the cleft, where one could imagine that the positively charged residues of
the motif could play a role in binding to the phosphodiester backbone of the
DNA helix. Conserved motif IX (RE) threaded its way through the small
domain which otherwise consisted of almost the entire variable region.

Motif IX appeared to form a backbone responsible for bracing the structure
of the small domain. Finally, conserved motif VI (ENV) was clearly involved
in correctly positioning motif IV.
   The structure provided a clear explanation for our earlier observation
that domain swaps that included both motif IX and the variable region were
more active as MTases than those involving just the variable region (Klima-
sauskas et al., 1991; Mi and Roberts, 1992). Although motif IX is quite
highly conserved among the MTases, there are differences from one MTase
to another and these could be expected to influence the ability of a heter-
ologous motif IX to brace the structure of the small domain.
   Soon after we obtained crystals of the binary complex between M.HhaI
and AdoMet, we set about trying to obtain co-crystals that would also
include DNA. Two kinds of complexes were envisioned. One would contain
M.HhaI together with native DNA and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy),
while another would contain M.HhaI with AdoMet and a DNA duplex
substituted with 5-fluorocytosine at the target. The latter would be expected
to form a covalent intermediate in which the methyl group had transferred
to the 5-position of cytosine, but release of the DNA from the covalent
complex with the protein would be inhibited by the presence of the fluorine
 atom, which is a very poor cleaving group. Such a complex could almost be
viewed as a transition state intermediate.
   Saulius Klimasauskas joined the project for the co-crystallization and we
were fortunate in obtaining good crystals fairly readily with both native

Fig. 8: Composite of the M.HhaI structures with and without DNA showing the conformational
changes that take place upon binding to DNA. The colors are as in Figure 7. The active site loop
(in yellow) is shown as a solid line to indicate its position in the ternary complex structure (with
DNA) and as a triple-stranded ribbon in the binary complex structure (no DNA).



cysteine residue must approach the cytosine in a direction perpendicular to
the plane of the ring. We imagined at most some extreme bending of the
DNA. Unexpectedly, the distortion is much greater than a bend and much
more elegant. The target cytosine flips right out of the axis of the DNA helix
and into a pocket in the enzyme that contains the catalytic cysteine residue.
The rest of the helix is relatively undistorted. Another large conformational
shift has taken place in the active site loop which encompasses motif IV. The
entire 20-residue loop rotates through almost 180 degrees from its original
position to bring the catalytic cysteine into contact with the target cytosine
(Figure 8).
  The position in the DNA helix that was occupied by the target cytosine, is
now filled by two residues. One is a glutamine residue from the small
domain and the other is a serine residue from the active site loop. Surpris-
ingly, neither of these residues is conserved among other m5C-MTases
suggesting that many residues could assist in opening a helix in this manner.
As can be seen from Figure 7, the interaction between M.HhaI and DNA
can be thought of as the enzyme embracing the DNA with two arms
infiltrating into the helix during the embrace and assisting the extrusion of
the target cytosine.
   The sequence specific interactions between M.HhaI and its substrate
mainly involve two distinct loops (the sequence recognition loops) from the
small domain. One loop is responsible for interactions with the orphan
guanosine that is left after the cytosine has flipped and makes specific

contacts with the adjacent bases on the same strand. It also provides the
glutamine residue that fills the hole left after the target cytosine is flipped.
The second recognition loop interacts predominantly with the strand con-
taining the target cytosine. However, the interactions in the covalent com-
plex should be viewed as an end point of a more complicated interaction.
They may not be an accurate reflection of the initial events which led to
recognition. More information of these initial events may be provided by
studies of mutant proteins or DNA analogs that can form complexes with-
out flipping the target cytosine. It should be noted that none of the well-
characterized DNA binding motifs (Harrison, 1991) appear to play a role in
this system.
   Previous studies of DNA protein interactions have shown quite dramatic
distortions induced in DNA by proteins, but usually these have involved
bends or kinks with one of the most dramatic being the flattening and
bending of DNA induced by the TATA-box binding protein (Rim, Y. et al.,
1993; Rim, J. et al., 1993). There have been no previous examples of
proteins interacting with DNA and causing a base to flip out of the helix.
Since the DNA bases lie buried in the inside of the helix in normal DNA, the
mechanism presented here provides an elegant means by which complete
access to the base becomes possible. We anticipate that other proteins
performing chemistry on DNA bases will also use this mechanism. Obvious
candidates would be the MTases that form N6-methyladenine or N4-methyl-
cytosine. Some of the enzymes, such as DNA glycosylases, that repair DNA
damage might also flip the damaged base out of the helix prior to its
excision. Many proteins that interact with DNA need to open up the helix.
Some examples would be topoisomerases, helicases, DNA polymerases
and/or their auxiliary proteins that operate at replication origins, RNA
polymerases and recombination enzymes. In the structure shown in Figure
9 the phosphodiester bonds, adjacent to the target cytosine, are distorted
from their positions in normal B DNA and one might imagine the continued
unzipping of the helix would be easy.
   Surprisingly, the interaction between M.HhaI and DNA requires no
external energy source. Conformational rearrangements within the protein
combined with specific interactions between protein and DNA likely pro-
vide the energy to open the helix. The energy is then stored for use during
the return of the target cytosine. It would be surprising if this mechanism is
not used elsewhere. Split genes were discovered unexpectedly, but proved
to be easily found once we knew they were there. This mechanism of
flipping a base out of the DNA helix might also prove to be of widespread
importance as a first step in opening up a DNA helix. We should lose no
time in exploring the possibility.
