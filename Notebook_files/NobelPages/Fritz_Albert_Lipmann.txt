'''Fritz Albert Lipmann''' ({{IPA-de|fʁɪt͡s ˈalbɛʁt ˈlɪpˌman|-|De-Fritz Albert Lipmann.ogg}}; June 12, 1899 – July 24, 1986) was a German-American [[biochemist]] and a co-discoverer in 1945 of [[coenzyme A]]. For this, together with other research on coenzyme A, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1953 (shared with [[Hans Adolf Krebs]]).<ref name="frs">{{Cite journal | last1 = Jencks | first1 = W.

==Early life and education==
Lipmann was born in [[Königsberg]], Germany, to a [[Jewish]] family. His parents were Gertrud (Lachmanski) and Leopold Lipmann, an attorney.<ref name=bio>{{cite web|title=Fritz Lipmann – Biographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1953/lipmann-bio.html|publisher= Nobel Prize}}</ref>

Lipmann studied medicine at the [[University of Königsberg]], [[University of Berlin|Berlin]], and [[University of Munich|Munich]], graduating in Berlin in 1924. He returned to Königsberg to study chemistry under Professor [[Hans Meerwein]]. In 1926 he joined [[Otto Meyerhof]] at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology]], [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Dahlem, Berlin]], for his doctoral thesis.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Richter, Dietmar|author=Krebs, Hans A.|author-link=Hans Krebs (biochemist)|author2=Lipmann, Fritz|title=Lipmann Symposium.

==Career==
From 1939 on, Lipmann lived and worked in the United States. He was a Research Associate in the Department of Biochemistry, [[Cornell University Medical College]], New York from 1939 to 1941. He joined the research staff of the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in Boston in 1941, first as a Research Associate in the Department of Surgery, then heading his own group in the Biochemical Research Laboratory of the hospital. From 1949 to 1957 he was professor of [[biochemistry|biological chemistry]] at [[Harvard Medical School]]. From 1957 onwards, he taught and conducted research at [[Rockefeller University]], [[New York, New York|New York City]].

In 1953, Lipmann received one half of the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine "for his discovery of co-enzyme A and its importance for intermediary metabolism." The other half of the award was won by [[Hans Adolf Krebs]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1953/summary/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1953|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-07}}</ref> Lipmann was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]] in 1966. He would try to dive further into his discovery by finding a variant of co-enzyme A, now known as [[Pantethine]].

Lipmann introduced the specific squiggle designation (~) to indicate high energy-rich phosphate in energy-rich biomolecules like ATP in his essay "Metabolic Generation and Utilization of Phosphate Bond Energy."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://biography.yourdictionary.com/fritz-lipmann|title=Fritz Lipmann Facts|website=biography.yourdictionary.com|access-date=2019-08-07}}</ref> Of his work, he said "that in the field of biosynthesis we have a rare example of progress leading to simplification."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=The Rockefeller University|date=1950-01-01|title=Fritz Lipmann, 1948|url=https://digitalcommons.rockefeller.edu/harvey-lectures/53|journal=Harvey Society Lectures}}</ref>
