==Early life and education==
Haroche was born in [[Casablanca|Casablanca, Morocco]], to Albert Haroche (1920–1998), from a [[History of the Jews in Morocco|Moroccan Jewish]] family, and Valentine Haroche, née [[Rublev (surname)|Roubleva]] (1921–1998) a teacher who was born in [[Odessa]] to a [[Jewish]] family of physicians who relocated to Morocco in the early 1920s. His father, a lawyer trained in [[Rabat]], was one of seven children born to a family of teachers (Isaac and Esther Haroche) who worked at the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle|''École de l’Alliance israélite'']] (AIU).<ref>{{cite web | date=2012-10-09 | url=http://www.jta.org/news/article/2012/10/09/3108811/french-jew-american-researcher-share-nobel-prize-in-physics | title=French Jew, American researcher share Nobel Prize in Physics | publisher=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] | access-date=2013-01-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last=Laskier | first=Michael M. | title=The Alliance Israélite Universelle and the Jewish Communities of Morocco: 1862–1962 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ngrRcV7XPgC&pg=PA192 | year=1983 | publisher=[[SUNY Press]] | location=[[New York City|New York]] | page=192| isbn=9780873956567 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.europeana.eu/resolve/record/09328/0FE56D02F385071C0A11573484717E9CFB9F7A7A | title=MAROC LXXV E 2.25 | access-date=2013-01-12 | publisher=Europeana}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | date=2012-10-09 | url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/news/62250 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171003225536/http://www.ejpress.org/article/news/62250 | url-status=dead | archive-date=2017-10-03 | title=French Jew wins 2012 Nobel Prize in Physics along with American colleague | publisher=European Jewish Press | access-date=2013-01-12 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=Jean-Louis Beaucarnot | date=2012-10-09 | url=http://www.rfgenealogie.com/s-informer/infos/celebrites/origines-et-genealogie-de-serge-haroche-nobel-de-physique | title=Origines et généalogie de Serge Haroche, prix Nobel de physique | publisher=La Revue française de Généalogie | access-date=2013-01-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=alexandra j. wall | date=2004-06-04 | url=http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/22861/new-jewish-agenda-founder-roublev-dies-at-69/ | title=New Jewish Agenda founder Roublev dies at 69 | publisher=jweekly.com | access-date=2013-01-12}}</ref><ref>[http://www27.us.archive.org/stream/schoolofpubliche1958colu/schoolofpubliche1958colu_djvu.txt Columbia University School of Public Health and Administrative Medicine, class of 1958 (p. 30)]: Alexander Roublev, M.D. (Serge Haroche's grandfather)</ref>  Both paternal grandparents of Serge Haroche had been AIU students in their respective hometowns of [[Marrakesh]] and [[Tétouan]] (the school which Esther Azerad attended in Tétouan had been founded in 1862; it was the first school of the AIU network).<ref>{{cite web | date=2017-06-14 | url=http://www.numericana.com/answer/haroche.htm#bio | title=Genealogy, career and personal life of Serge Haroche | publisher=Numericana | access-date=2017-11-02}}</ref>

Haroche left [[Morocco]] and settled in France in 1956, at the end of the [[French protectorate of Morocco|French protectorate]] treaty.

==Career==
Haroche worked in the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]] (CNRS) as a research scientist from 1967 to 1975, and spent a year (1972–1973) as a visiting post-doc in [[Stanford University]], in [[Arthur Leonard Schawlow]]'s team. In 1975 he moved to a professor position at [[Paris VI University]]. At the same time he taught in other institutions, in particular at the [[École polytechnique]] (1973–1984), [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] (1980)[http://web.mit.edu/ir/pop/awards/nobel_by_year.html], [[Harvard University]] (1981), [[Yale University]] (1984–1993) and [[Conservatoire national des arts et métiers]] (2000). He was head of the Physics department at the [[École Normale Supérieure|École normale supérieure]] from 1994 to 2000.

Since 2001, Haroche has been a  Professor at the Collège de France and holds the [[Quantum mechanics|Chair of Quantum Physics]].
He is a member of the [[Société Française de Physique]], the [[European Physical Society|European Physical society]] and a fellow and member of the [[American Physical Society]].

In September 2012, Serge Haroche was elected by his peers to the position of administrator of the Collège de France.

On 9 October 2012 Haroche was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], together with the American physicist [[David Wineland]], for their work regarding measurement and manipulation of individual quantum systems.

In 2020, Haroche was appointed by [[European Commissioner for Innovation, Research, Culture, Education and Youth]] [[Mariya Gabriel]] to serve on an independent search committee for the next president of the [[European Research Council]] (ERC), chaired by [[Helga Nowotny]].<ref>[https://ec.europa.eu/info/news/commission-appoints-independent-search-committee-and-invites-nominations-and-applications-fill-post-next-president-european-research-council-2020-oct-09_en Commission appoints independent Search Committee and invites nominations and applications to fill the post of the next President of the European Research Council] [[European Commission]], press release of October 9, 2020.</ref>

After a [[PhD]] dissertation on dressed atoms under the supervision of [[Claude Cohen-Tannoudji]] (himself a Nobel Prize recipient) from 1967 to 1971, he developed new methods for [[laser spectroscopy]], based on the study of [[quantum beats]] and [[superradiance]]. He then moved on to [[Rydberg atom]]s, giant atomic states particularly sensitive to [[microwave]]s, which makes them well adapted for studying the interactions between light and matter. He showed that such atoms, coupled to a [[superconductivity|superconducting]] cavity containing a few [[photon]]s, are well-suited to the testing of [[quantum decoherence]] and to the realization of [[quantum logic]] operations necessary for the treatment of [[quantum information]].
