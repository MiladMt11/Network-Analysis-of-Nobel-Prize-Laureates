'''Patrick Victor Martindale White''' (28 May 1912 – 30 September 1990) was an Australian writer who published 12 novels, three short-story collections, and eight plays, from 1935 to 1987.

White's fiction employs humour, florid prose, shifting [[Point of view (literature)|narrative vantage points]] and [[stream of consciousness technique]]s. In 1973 he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehat.com.au/australia/people/NobelPrize.asp |title=Australian Nobel Prize Winners |publisher=Whitehat.com.au |date=2 December 2006 |access-date=1 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902083030/http://whitehat.com.au/Australia/People/NobelPrize.asp |archive-date=2 September 2011 }}</ref> "for an epic and psychological narrative art which has introduced a new continent into literature", as it says in the Swedish Academy's citation,<ref>"Nobel Prize in Literature 1973 – Press Release".

Coetzee]] won the award in 2003 as a South African citizen, before he became an Australian citizen in 2006.</ref> White was also the inaugural recipient of the [[Miles Franklin Award]].

==Childhood and adolescence==
White was born in [[Knightsbridge]], London, to Victor Martindale White and Ruth (née Withycombe), both Australians, in their apartment overlooking [[Hyde Park, London]] on 28 May 1912.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marr|first=David|title=Patrick White, a life|year=1991|publisher=Random House|location=Milsons Point, NSW|isbn=0091825857|pages=4}}</ref> His family returned to Sydney, Australia, when he was six months old. As a child he lived in a flat with his sister, a nanny, and a maid while his parents lived in an adjoining flat.  In 1916 they moved to a house in [[Elizabeth Bay, New South Wales|Elizabeth Bay]] that many years later became a nursing home, Lulworth House, the residents of which included [[Gough Whitlam]], [[Neville Wran]], and White's partner [[Manoly Lascaris]].<ref>[https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/patrick-whites-mandala-dies-at-91-20031120-gdhtdh.html Sydney Morning Herald, 20 November 2003]</ref>

At the age of four, White developed asthma, a condition that had taken the life of his maternal grandfather. White's health was fragile throughout his childhood, which precluded his participation in many childhood activities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Patrick White - Biographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1973/white-bio.html|work=website|publisher=Nobelprize.org|access-date=5 December 2013}}</ref>

He loved the theatre, which he first visited at an early age (his mother took him to see ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' at the age of six). This love was expressed at home when he performed private rites in the garden and danced for his mother's friends.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marr|first=David|title=Patrick White, a life|year=1991|publisher=Random House|location=Milsons Point, NSW|isbn=0091825857|pages=37–38}}</ref>

At the age of five, he attended kindergarten at Sandtoft in [[Woollahra, New South Wales|Woollahra]], in Sydney's [[Eastern Suburbs (Sydney)|Eastern Suburbs]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Marr|first=David|title=Patrick White, a life|year=1991|publisher=Random House|location=Milsons Point, NSW|isbn=0091825857|pages=33}}</ref>

At the age of ten, White was sent to [[Tudor House School]], a boarding school in [[Moss Vale, New South Wales|Moss Vale]] in the [[Southern Highlands (New South Wales)|Southern Highlands]] of New South Wales, in an attempt to abate his asthma. It took him some time to adjust to the presence of other children. At boarding school, he started to write plays. Even at this early age, White wrote about palpably adult themes. In 1924, the boarding school ran into financial trouble, and the headmaster suggested for White to be sent to a [[independent school (United Kingdom)|public school]] in England, a suggestion that his parents accepted.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marr|first=David|title=Patrick White, a life|year=1991|publisher=Random House|location=Milsons Point, NSW|isbn=0091825857|pages=57–66}}</ref>

[[File:Lulworth-Elizabeth-Bay-NSW-Dec-2019.jpg|thumb|Lulworth, White's childhood home in [[Elizabeth Bay, New South Wales|Elizabeth Bay]], Sydney]]

White struggled to adjust to his new surroundings at [[Cheltenham College]], England. He later described it as "a four-year prison sentence".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/pwhite.htm|title=Patrick White|website=Books and Writers (kirjasto.sci.fi)|first=Petri|last=Liukkonen|publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library|location=Finland|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150111075937/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/pwhite.htm|archive-date=11 January 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> White withdrew socially and had a limited circle of acquaintances. Occasionally, he would holiday with his parents at European locations, but their relationship remained distant. However he did spend time with his cousin Jack Withycombe during this period, and Jack's daughter [[Elizabeth Withycombe]] became a mentor to him while he was writing his first book of poems, ''Thirteen Poems'' between the years 1927–29.<ref name="NLA">{{cite web|title=Thirteen poems / by P.V.M. White|url=https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/6935186|website=National Library of Australia|publisher=National Library of Australia|access-date=29 October 2017}}</ref>

While at school in London, White made one close friend, Ronald Waterall, an older boy who shared similar interests. White's biographer, [[David Marr (journalist)|David Marr]], wrote that "the two men would walk, arm-in-arm, to London shows; and stand around stage doors crumbing for a glimpse of their favourite stars, giving a practical demonstration of a chorus girl's high kick... with appropriate vocal accompaniment". When Waterall left school, White withdrew again. He asked his parents if he could leave school to become an actor. The parents compromised and allowed him to finish school early if he came home to Australia to try life on the land. His parents felt that he should work on the land rather than become a writer and hoped that his work as a [[Jackaroo (trainee)|jackaroo]] would temper his artistic ambitions.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marr|first=David|title=Patrick White, a life|year=1991|publisher=Random House|location=Milsons Point, NSW|isbn=0091825857}}</ref>

White spent two years working as a [[stockman (Australia)|stockman]] at Bolaro, a {{Convert|73|km2|adj=on}} station near [[Adaminaby]], on the edge of the [[Snowy Mountains]], in southeastern Australia. Although he grew to respect the land and his health improved, it was clear that he was not cut out for this life.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marr|first=David|title=Patrick White, a life|year=1991|publisher=Random House|location=Milsons Point, NSW|isbn=0091825857|pages=93–99}}</ref>

==Travelling the world==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:White p.jpg|thumb|right|''Patrick White: A Life'' by [[David Marr (journalist)|David Marr]] (1991). The cover portrait is a detail from a 1980 painting of White by Australian artist [[Brett Whiteley]].]] -->

From 1932 to 1935, White lived in England, studying French and German literature at [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. During his time at Cambridge he developed a romantic attraction to a young man who had come to King's College to become an Anglican priest. White dared not speak of his feelings for fear of losing the friendship and, like many other gay men of that period, he feared that his sexuality would doom him to a lonely life. Then, one night, the student priest, after an awkward liaison with two women, admitted to White that women meant nothing to him sexually. That became White's first love affair.

During White's time at Cambridge he published a collection of poetry entitled ''The Ploughman and Other Poems'', and wrote a play named ''Bread and Butter Women'', which was later performed by an amateur group (which included his sister Suzanne) at the tiny [[Beryl Bryant|Bryant's Playhouse]] in Sydney.<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article28015118 "Social and Personal" ''Sydney Morning Herald'' 7 February 1935 p.13]. Retrieved 27 November 2012.</ref> After being admitted to the degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1935, White briefly settled in London, where he lived in an area that was frequented by artists. There, the young author thrived creatively for a time, writing several unpublished works and reworking ''[[Happy Valley (1939 novel)|Happy Valley]]'', a novel that he had written while jackarooing. In 1937, White's father died, leaving him ten thousand pounds in inheritance. The fortune enabled him to write full-time in relative comfort. Two more plays followed before he succeeded in finding a publisher for ''Happy Valley''. The novel was received well in London but poorly in Australia. He began writing another novel, ''Nightside'', but abandoned it before its completion after receiving negative comments, a decision that he later admitted regretting.

In 1936, White met the painter [[Roy De Maistre]], 18 years his senior, who became an important influence in his life and work. The two men never became lovers but remained firm friends. In White's own words, "He became what I most needed, an intellectual and aesthetic mentor". They had many similarities: they were both gay and they both felt like outsiders in their own families; as a result they both had ambivalent feelings about their families and backgrounds, yet both maintained close and lifelong links with their families, particularly their mothers. They also both appreciated the benefits of social standing and connections and Christian symbolism and biblical themes are common in both artists' work.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/arts/white/life/life3/life_C05.html Why bother with Patrick White?]. Retrieved 27 November 2012.</ref>

White dedicated his first novel ''Happy Valley'' to De Maistre and acknowledged De Maistre's influence on his writing. In 1947, De Maistre's painting ''Figure in a Garden (The Aunt)'' was used as the cover for the first edition of White's ''The Aunt's Story''. White bought many of De Maistre's paintings. In 1974 White gave all his paintings by De Maistre to the [[Art Gallery of New South Wales]].

Towards the end of the 1930s, White spent time in the United States, including [[Cape Cod]], Massachusetts, and [[New York City]], which were artistic hotbeds at the time, where he wrote ''The Living and the Dead''. By the time World War II broke out, he had returned to London and joined the British [[Royal Air Force]]. He was accepted as an intelligence officer, and was posted to the Middle East. He served in Egypt, Palestine, and Greece before the war was over. While in the Middle East, he had an affair with a Greek army officer, [[Manoly Lascaris]], who was to become his life partner.<ref name="cambridge">{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Australian Literature|first=Elizabeth|last=Webby|year=2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-65843-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani0000unse_w3b1/page/235 235]|url=https://archive.org/details/cambridgecompani0000unse_w3b1/page/235}}</ref>

White and Lascaris lived together in Cairo for six years before moving to a small farm purchased by White<ref name=adb>Webby, Elizabeth (2012) [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/white-patrick-victor-paddy-14925 White, Patrick Victor (Paddy) (1912–1990)].

==Growth of writing career==
[[File:(1)Patrick White house Castle Hill-2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|White's house in Castle Hill, Sydney]]
After the war, White once again returned to Australia, buying an old house in [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]], now a Sydney suburb but then semi-rural. He named the house "The Dogwoods," after trees he planted there.<ref>The Hills Independent, Issue 49, July 2019, p.10</ref> In this house, he settled down with Lascaris, the Greek he had met during the war. They lived there for 18 years, selling flowers, vegetables, milk, and cream as well as pedigree puppies.<ref name="Obituary: Manoly Lascaris">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/dec/08/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries|title=Manoly Lascaris: Patrick White's devoted companion, and a source of good stories for his novels|last=Jones|first=Philip|date=8 December 2003|work=The Guardian |location=UK}}</ref> During these years he started to make a reputation for himself as a writer, publishing ''The Aunt's Story'' and ''The Tree of Man'' in the United States in 1955 and shortly after in the United Kingdom. ''The Tree of Man'' was released to rave reviews in the United States, but in what had become a typical pattern, it was panned in Australia. White had doubts about whether to continue writing after his books were largely dismissed in Australia (three of them having been called 'un-Australian' by critics), but, in the end, he decided to persevere. His first breakthrough in Australia came when his next novel, ''[[Voss (novel)|Voss]]'', won the inaugural [[Miles Franklin Literary Award]].

In 1961, White published ''[[Riders in the Chariot]]''. It was to become both a bestseller and a prizewinner, gaining him a second Miles Franklin Award. In 1963, White and Lascaris decided to sell the house at Castle Hill. A number of White's works from the 1960s depict the fictional town of Sarsaparilla, including his collection of short stories, ''[[The Burnt Ones]]'', and the play, ''[[The Season at Sarsaparilla]]''. By now, he had clearly established his reputation as one of the world's great authors, but remained an essentially private person, resisting opportunities for interviews and public appearances although his circle of friends had widened significantly.

In 1968, White wrote ''The Vivisector'', a searing character portrait of an artist. Many people{{who|date=September 2018}} drew links to the Sydney painter [[John Passmore (artist)|John Passmore]] (1904–84) and White's friend, the painter [[Sidney Nolan]], but White denied the connections. Patrick White was an art collector who had, as a young man, been deeply impressed by his friends [[Roy De Maistre]] and [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]], and later said he wished he had been an artist.<ref name="Hewitt, Helen Verity 2002">Hewitt, Helen Verity: Patrick White, Painter Manque. Carlton, Vic. : Miegunyah Press, 2002. {{ISBN|0-522-85032-4}}</ref> By the mid-1960s, he had also become interested in encouraging dozens of young and less established artists, such as [[James Clifford (artist)|James Clifford]], [[Erica McGilchrist]], and [[Lawrence Daws]].<ref name="Hewitt, Helen Verity 2002"/> White was later friends with [[Brett Whiteley]], the young star of Australian painting, in the 1970s. That friendship ended when White felt that Whiteley, a heroin addict, was deceitful and pushy about selling his paintings.<ref name="Hewitt, Helen Verity 2002"/> A portrait of White by [[Louis Kahan]] won the 1962 [[Archibald Prize]].<ref>[http://www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/work/OA2.1963/ Portrait of Patrick White, (1962) by Louis Kahan], artgallery.nsw.gov.au. Retrieved 18 November 2011.</ref>

White decided not to accept any more prizes for his work, and he declined both the $10,000 Britannia Award and another Miles Franklin Award. White was approached by [[Harry M. Miller]] to work on a screenplay for ''Voss'' but nothing came of it. He became an active opponent of literary censorship and joined a number of other public figures in signing a statement of defiance against Australia's decision to participate in the [[Vietnam War]]. His name had sometimes been mentioned as a contender for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], but in 1971, after losing to [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], he wrote to a friend: ''That Nobel Prize! I hope I never hear it mentioned again. I certainly don't want it; the machinery behind it seems a bit dirty, when we thought that only applied to Australian awards. In my case to win the prize would upset my life far too much, and it would embarrass me to be held up to the world as an Australian writer when, apart from the accident of blood, I feel I am temperamentally a cosmopolitan Londoner''.<ref>Letter to Frederick Glover, 28 November 1971, in ''Patrick White: Letters'', ed. David Marr, p. 389</ref>

[[File:(1)Patrick White house Centennial Park.jpg|upright=1.4|thumb|Patrick White's home [[Highbury, Centennial Park|Highbury]], in [[Centennial Park, New South Wales|Centennial Park]], Sydney]]

Nevertheless, in 1973, White did accept the Nobel Prize "for an epic and psychological narrative art, which has introduced a new continent into literature". His cause was said to have been championed by a Scandinavian diplomat resident in Australia.<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Wendy Lewis]], Simon Balderstone and John Bowan | title=Events That Shaped Australia | pages=244–247 | publisher=New Holland | year=2006 | isbn=978-1-74110-492-9 }}</ref> White enlisted Nolan to travel to Stockholm to accept the prize on his behalf. The award had an immediate impact on his career, as his publisher doubled the print run for ''[[The Eye of the Storm (novel)|The Eye of the Storm]]'' and gave him a larger advance for his next novel. White used the money from the prize to establish a trust to fund the [[Patrick White Award]], given annually to established creative writers who have received little public recognition. He was invited by the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] to be seated on the floor of the House in recognition of his achievement. White declined, explaining that his nature could not easily adapt itself to such a situation.<ref>Gavin Souter, ''Acts of Parliament'', p. 516</ref> The last time such an invitation had been extended was in 1928, to [[Bert Hinkler]].

White was made [[Australian of the Year]] for 1974,<ref>{{cite book | author=Lewis, Wendy | title=Australians of the Year | publisher=Pier 9 Press | year=2010 | isbn=978-1-74196-809-5 |author-link=Wendy Lewis}}</ref> but in a typically rebellious fashion, his acceptance speech encouraged Australians to spend the day reflecting on the state of the country. Privately, he was less than enthusiastic about it. In a letter to Marshall Best on 27 January 1974, he wrote: "Something terrible happened to me last week. There is an organisation which chooses an Australian of the Year, who has to appear at an official lunch in [[Melbourne Town Hall]] on [[Australia Day]]. This year I was picked on as they had run through all the swimmers, tennis players, yachtsmen".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/National/A-day-Down-Under/2005/01/25/1106415591470.html|title=A day Down Under|date=26 January 2005|work=The Age |location=Australia}}</ref>

==Personal life==
White and Lascaris hosted many dinner parties at Highbury, their Centennial Park home, in a leafy part of the affluent Eastern Suburbs of Sydney. In ''Patrick White, A Life'', his biographer [[David Marr (journalist)|David Marr]] portrays White as a genial host but one who easily fell out with friends.

White supported the conservative, business oriented [[Liberal Party of Australia]] until the election of [[Gough Whitlam]]'s [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government and, following the [[1975 Australian constitutional crisis]], he became particularly [[Republicanism in Australia|antiroyalist]], making a rare appearance on national television to broadcast his views on the matter. White also publicly expressed his admiration for the historian [[Manning Clark]], satirist [[Barry Humphries]], and unionist [[Jack Mundey]].

===Failing health===
During the 1970s, White's health began to deteriorate: he had issues with his teeth, his eyesight was failing and he had chronic lung problems. It was during this time that White became more openly political.  He began to occasionally comment on current issues. He was among the first group of the Companions of the [[Order of Australia]] in 1975 but resigned in June 1976 in protest at the dismissal of the Whitlam government in November 1975 by the Governor-General Sir [[John Kerr (governor-general)|John Kerr]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=9ivDCk7_XHsC&pg=PT83 Patrick White, Patrick White Speaks]. (Retrieved 12 April 2014.) '''Note''': It is often stated that Patrick White resigned from the Order of Australia for the same reason that [[H. C. Coombs|"Nugget" Coombs]] did, namely, in protest at the introduction of the level of Knight and Dame into the order in May 1976.  It is true that White's resignation came after that event, but it was not because of it. According to his own testimony, White's reason was the dismissal of the elected government of Gough Whitlam by the Governor-General Sir John Kerr in November 1975. Kerr had been influential in persuading White to accept the award in the first place.</ref> In 1979, his novel ''[[The Twyborn Affair]]'' was shortlisted for the [[Booker Prize]], but White requested that it to be removed to give younger writers a chance to win. (The prize was won by [[Penelope Fitzgerald]], who ironically was just four years younger than White.) Soon after, White announced that he had written his last novel, and from then on, he would write only for radio or the stage.

Director [[Jim Sharman]] introduced himself to White while walking down a Sydney street.  This occurred some time after White had seen a politically loaded stage revue by Sharman, ''Terror Australis'', which had been panned by Sydney newspaper critics.  White had written a letter to the editor of a newspaper defending the show.<ref>White, ''Flaws in the Glass'', ch. "Jimmy Sharman and his Acting Troupe"</ref>  There a significant difference in their ages.  However, after a while the two men became friends and Sharman and his theatrical circle, as well as his visual style as a director, would inspire White to write a couple of new plays, notably ''[[Big Toys]]'' with its satirical portrayal of a posh and vulgar upper-class Sydney society.<ref>white, ibid</ref> A few years later, Sharman asked White if he could make a film of ''[[The Night the Prowler]]''. White agreed and wrote the screenplay for the film.<ref>Marr, David. Patrick White: A Life. Random House Australia, Sydney, 1991.</ref>

In 1981, White published his autobiography, ''Flaws in the Glass: a self-portrait'', which explored issues about which he had publicly said little, such as his homosexuality, his dislike of the "subservient" attitude of Australian society towards Britain and the Royal family, and also the distance he had felt from his mother. On [[Palm Sunday]], 1982, White addressed a crowd of 30,000 people, calling for a ban on [[uranium mining in Australia|uranium mining]] and for the destruction of [[nuclear weapons]].

In 1986 White released one last novel, ''[[Memoirs of Many in One]]'', but it was published under the pen name "Alex Xenophon Demirjian Gray" with White named as editor. In the same year, ''Voss'' was turned into [[Voss (opera)|an opera]], with music by [[Richard Meale]] and the libretto adapted by [[David Malouf]]. White refused to see it when it was first performed at the [[Adelaide Festival of Arts]], because [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] had been invited, and chose instead to see it later in Sydney. In 1987, White wrote ''[[Three Uneasy Pieces]]'', which incorporated his musings on ageing and society's efforts to achieve aesthetic perfection. When David Marr finished his biography of White in July 1990, his subject spent nine days going over the details with him.

White died in Sydney on 30 September 1990.

==Legacy==
In 2009, The Sydney Theatre Company staged White's play ''The Season at Sarsaparilla''. In 2010 White received posthumous recognition for his novel ''The Vivisector'', which was shortlisted for the [[Lost Man Booker Prize]] for 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/australian-authors-shortlisted-for-lost-man-booker-prize-20100326-r0qr.html|title=Australian authors shortlisted for lost Man Booker Prize|date=26 March 2010|access-date=7 April 2010|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Sorensen, Rosemary|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/arts/patrick-white-on-lost-booker-shortlist/story-e6frg8n6-1225846198615|title=Patrick White on 'Lost Booker' shortlist|date=27 March 2010|access-date=7 April 2010|work=The Australian}}</ref>

In 2011 Fred Schepisi's [[The Eye of the Storm (2011 film)|film]] of ''[[The Eye of the Storm (novel)|The Eye of the Storm]]'' was released with screenplay adaptation by [[Judy Morris]], [[Geoffrey Rush]] playing the son Basil, [[Judy Davis]] as the daughter Dorothy, and [[Charlotte Rampling]] as the dying matriarch Elizabeth Hunter. This is the first screen realisation of a White novel, fittingly the one that played a key role in the Swedish panel's choice of White as Nobel prize winner.
