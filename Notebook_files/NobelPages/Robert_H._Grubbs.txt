'''Robert Howard Grubbs''' <small>[[Foreign Member of the Royal Society|ForMemRS]]</small> (born February 27, 1942) is an American [[chemist]] and the Victor and Elizabeth Atkins Professor of Chemistry at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in [[Pasadena]], [[California]].<ref name="AICGOld" /> He was a co-recipient of the 2005 [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry for his work on [[olefin metathesis]].<ref name="PressRelease">{{cite web |title=Press Release, 5 October 2005 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2005/press.html |website=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2005 |publisher=NobelPrize.org |access-date=April 12, 2016}}</ref>

== Early life and education ==
[[File:Robert H. Grubbs HD2010 AIC Gold Medal 2.JPG|thumb|right|AIC Gold Medal recipient, 2010]]

Grubbs was born on February 27, 1942, on a farm in [[Marshall County, Kentucky]], midway between [[Possum Trot, Kentucky|Possum Trot]] and [[Calvert City, Kentucky|Calvert City]].<ref name="Jackson" /><ref name="NobelBio">{{cite web |title=Robert H.

After serving in [[World War II]], the family moved to [[Paducah, Kentucky]], where Howard trained as a diesel mechanic, and Robert attended [[Paducah Tilghman High School]].<ref name="Jackson">{{cite web |title=Jackson Purchase Nobel Laureate |url=http://jacksonpurchasehistory.org/2010/12/13/jackson-purchase-nobel-laureate/ |website=Jackson Purchase Historical Society |access-date=April 12, 2016}}</ref><ref name="NobelBio" />

At the [[University of Florida]], Grubbs initially intended to study agriculture. However, he was convinced by professor [[Merle Battiste|Merle A. Battiste]] to switch to organic chemistry.<ref name="Sikes" /> Working with Battiste, he became interested in how chemical reactions occur.<ref name="NobelBio" /> He received his B.S. in 1963 and M.S. in 1965 from the University of Florida.<ref name="Sikes">{{cite news |last1=Janine Young |first1=Sikes |title=A Gator wins Nobel in chemistry |url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20051006/LOCAL/51006006 |access-date=April 14, 2016 |work=The Gainesville Sun |date=October 6, 2005}}</ref>

Next, Grubbs attended [[Columbia University]], where he worked with [[Ronald Breslow]] and organometallic compounds which contain carbon-metal bonds. Grubbs received his [[PhD]] in 1968.<ref name="grubbsphd">{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Robert Howard |last=Grubbs |title=I. Cyclebutadiene Derivatives II.

== Career ==
Grubbs worked with [[James P. Collman|James Collman]] at [[Stanford University]] as a [[National Institutes of Health]] fellow during 1968–1969. With Collman, he began to systematically investigate catalytic processes in organometallic chemistry, a relatively new area of research.<ref name="NobelBio" />

In 1969, Grubbs was appointed to the faculty of [[Michigan State University]], where he began his work on olefin metathesis. Harold Hart, Gerasimos J. Karabatsos, Gene LeGoff, Don Farnum, Bill Reusch and Pete Wagner served as his early mentors at MSU.<ref name="NobelBio" /> Grubbs was an assistant professor from 1969 to 1973, and an associate professor from 1973 to 1978.<ref name="Leadership">{{cite web |title=Robert H.

In 1978 Grubbs moved to [[California Institute of Technology]] as a professor of chemistry. As of 1990 he became the Victor and Elizabeth Atkins Professor of Chemistry.<ref name="Britannica">{{cite book |chapter=Robert H. Grubbs American chemist |title=Encyclopædia Britannica |chapter-url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Robert-H-Grubbs}}</ref><ref name="scalacs" />

Grubbs's main research interests are in [[organometallic chemistry]] and [[organic chemistry|synthetic chemistry]], particularly the development of novel catalysts for [[olefin metathesis]]. In olefin metathesis, a catalyst is used to break the bonds of carbon molecules, which can then re-form to create chemical bonds in new ways, producing new compounds with unique properties.<ref name="Sikes" /><ref name="Miree-Luke">{{cite news |last1=Miree-Luke |first1=Lisa |title=Axalta's Distinguished Lecture Series at the University of Pennsylvania Features Presentation on Methathesis Polymerization |url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151008005945/en/Axalta%E2%80%99s-Distinguished-Lecture-Series-University-Pennsylvania-Features |access-date=April 14, 2016 |work=Business Wire |date=October 8, 2015}}</ref> The basic technique can be used for creation of polymers, pharmaceuticals and petrochemicals<ref name="Pearson" /> and has broad applications in areas including [[pharmaceuticals]], [[biotechnology]], [[agriculture]], and [[plastics]].<ref name="Sikes" />

Ruthenium is stable in air and has higher selectivity and lower reactivity than [[molybdenum]], the most promising of the previously discovered catalysts.

By controlling the catalyst used, it becomes possible to synthesize polymers with specialized structures and functional capabilities, including cyclic olefins, alternating copolymers, and multiblock copolymers.<ref name="Miree-Luke" /> Using catalysts allows chemists to speed up chemical transformations and to lower the cost of what were previously complicated multi-step industrial processes.<ref name="Ingredient" />
