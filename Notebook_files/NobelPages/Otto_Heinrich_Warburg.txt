==Biography==
Otto Heinrich Warburg was born in Freiburg im Breisgau in 1883, close to the Swiss border. Otto's mother was the daughter of a Protestant family of bankers and civil servants from [[Baden]]. His father, [[Emil Warburg]], had converted to Protestantism as an adult, although Emil's parents were Orthodox Jews.<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=4327324 | pmid=25717390 | doi=10.5041/RMMJ.10183 | volume=6 | issue=1 | title=Dr. Otto heinrich warburg-survivor of ethical storms | journal=Rambam Maimonides Med J | page=e0008 | last1 = Weisz | first1 = GM| year=2015 }}</ref> Emil was a member of the illustrious [[Warburg family]] of [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]], and had converted to Christianity reportedly after a disagreement with his [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Jewish]] parents. Emil was also president of the ''Physikalische Reichsanstalt, Wirklicher Geheimer Oberregierungsrat'' (True Senior Privy Counselor).

Otto Warburg studied chemistry under [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]], and earned his doctorate in chemistry in [[Berlin]] in 1906. He then studied under [[Ludolf von Krehl]] and earned the degree of doctor of medicine in [[Heidelberg]] in 1911.

Between 1908 and 1914, Warburg was affiliated with the [[Stazione Zoologica|Naples Marine Biological Station]], (in [[Naples]], Italy), where he conducted research. In later years, he would return for visits, and maintained a lifelong friendship with the family of the station's director, [[Anton Dohrn]].

A lifelong equestrian, he served as an officer in the elite [[Uhlans#German Uhlans|Uhlans]] (cavalry) on the front during the [[First World War]], where he won the [[Iron Cross]]. Warburg later credited this experience with affording him invaluable insights into "real life" outside the confines of academia. Toward the end of the war, when the outcome was unmistakable, [[Albert Einstein]], who had been a friend of Warburg's father Emil, wrote to Warburg at the behest of friends, asking him to leave the army and return to academia, since it would be a tragedy for the world to lose his talents. Einstein and Warburg later became friends, and Einstein's work in physics had a great influence on Warburg's biochemical research.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Scientific work and Nobel Prize==
[[File:Otto Heinrich Warburg (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Otto H. Warburg, 1931]]
While working at the Marine Biological Station, Warburg performed research on oxygen consumption in [[sea urchin]] eggs after [[fertilization]] and showed that upon fertilization the rate of respiration increases as much as sixfold. His experiments also showed that iron is essential for the development of the larval stage.

In 1918, Warburg was appointed professor at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Biology]] in [[Berlin-Dahlem]] (part of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute|Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft]]). By 1931 he was named director of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Cell Physiology]], which had been founded the previous year by a donation of the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] to the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft (since renamed the [[Max Planck Society]]).

Warburg investigated the metabolism of [[tumor]]s and the [[cellular respiration|respiration of cells]], particularly cancer cells, and in 1931 was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Physiology]] for his "discovery of the nature and mode of action of the respiratory enzyme".<ref name="prize">NobelPrize.org, [https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1931/ The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1931] accessed April 20, 2007</ref> In particular, he discovered that animal tumors produce large quantities of [[lactic acid]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev-cancerbio-030419-033556|title=Lactate and Acidity in the Cancer Microenvironment|year=2020|last1=Parks|first1=Scott K.|last2=Mueller-Klieser|first2=Wolfgang|last3=Pouysségur|first3=Jacques|journal=Annual Review of Cancer Biology|volume=4|pages=141–158|doi-access=free}}</ref> The award came after receiving 46 nominations over a period of nine years beginning in 1923, 13 of which were submitted in 1931, the year he won the prize.<ref name="nobelnom">{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/nomination/nomination.php?action=simplesearch&string=otto%20h%20warburg&start=1 | title = Nomination Database - Physiology or Medicine | publisher = [[Nobelprize.org]]| access-date = 2011-06-04}}</ref>

Nobel Laureate [[George Wald]], having completed his Ph.D. in zoology at Columbia University, received an award from the U.S. National Research Council to study with Warburg. During his time with Warburg, 1932–1933, Wald discovered vitamin A in the retina.

==Survival under the Nazis==
When the Nazis came to power, people of Jewish descent were forced from their professional positions, although the Nazis made exceptions. Warburg had a Protestant mother and a father with Jewish heritage (who had converted to Protestantism). Although banned from teaching, he was allowed to carry on his research.<ref name="Medawar & Pyke. Page 184">Medawar & Pyke. Page 184.</ref>

According to the Reichsbürgergesetz from 1935 (cf. [[Nuremberg Laws]]) Warburg was considered by the Nazis a half-Jew (Halbjude) or [[Mischling]] and in September 1942 he issued an official request for equal status ("Gleichstellung") with Germans, which was granted.<ref>Reinhard Rürup, unter Mitwirkung von Michael Schüring: Schicksale und Karrieren: Gedenkbuch für die von den Nationalsozialisten aus der Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft vertriebenen Forscherinnen und Forscher. Wallstein 2008, S. 83f. {{ISBN|978-3-89244-797-9}}</ref>

In 1941, Warburg lost his post briefly when he made critical remarks about the regime, but a few weeks later a personal order from Hitler's Chancellery ordered him to resume work on his cancer research. Göring also arranged for him to be classified as one-quarter Jewish.<ref name="Medawar & Pyke. Page 184"/>

It is believed that Warburg was so totally dedicated to his work that he was prepared not only to stay in Germany but also to accept the Nazi treatment of his Jewish colleagues and his Jewish relatives.<ref>Medawar & Pyke. Page 185.</ref> This was despite his having received an offer from the Rockefeller Foundation to continue to fund his work if he emigrated. After the end of the Second World War, he made inquiries about moving to the United States of America, but his approach then was turned down.

In 1943 Warburg relocated his laboratory to the village of Liebenburg on the outskirts of Berlin to avoid ongoing air attacks.

==Nomination for a second Nobel Prize==
[[File:Drs. Otto Warburg, Bernardo Houssay and Rollo Dyer (14172706319).jpg|thumb|Dr. Otto Warburg (extreme left) at the National Institute of Health, USA]]
In 1944, Warburg was nominated for a second Nobel Prize in Physiology by [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]], for his work on [[nicotinamide]], the mechanism and [[enzyme]]s involved in fermentation, and the discovery of [[Flavin group|flavin]] (in [[lumiflavin|yellow enzymes]]).<ref name="Nobel-1972_210">{{Harvnb|Liljestrand|Bernhard|1972|loc="The Prize in Physiology or Medicine", p. 210}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/nomination/nomination.php?action=show&showid=1089 | title = Nomination Database - Physiology or Medicine | publisher = [[Nobelprize.org]] | year = 1944 | access-date = 2011-06-04}}</ref> Some sources report that he was selected to receive the award that year, but was prevented from receiving it by [[Nazi Germany|Adolf Hitler's regime]], which had issued a decree in 1937 that forbade Germans from accepting Nobel Prizes.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9076088 | title=Otto Warburg | encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online | year=2007 | access-date=2007-11-12 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219084948/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9076088 | archive-date=2007-12-19 }}</ref><ref name="Chernow-539-541">[[Otto Heinrich Warburg#refChernow1993|Chernow 539-541]].</ref> According to the Nobel Foundation, this rumor is not true; although he was considered a worthy candidate, he was not selected for the prize at that time.<ref name="Nobel-1972_210" />

Three scientists who worked in Warburg's lab, including Sir [[Hans Adolf Krebs]], went on to win the Nobel Prize in future years. Among other discoveries, Krebs is credited with the identification of the [[citric acid cycle]] (or Szentgyörgyi-Krebs cycle).

Warburg's combined work in [[plant physiology]], [[cell metabolism]], and [[oncology]] made him an integral figure in the later development of [[systems biology]].<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20111223121323/http://vcp.med.harvard.edu/papers/SB200-new-1.pdf A Systems Approach to Biology, by Jeremy Gunawardena, Department of Systems Biology, Harvard Medical School, lecture 1, September 2011] retrieved 5 May 2012</ref> He worked with [[Dean Burk]] on the quantum yield of [[photosynthesis]].

==Cancer hypothesis==
{{Main|Warburg hypothesis}}
Warburg hypothesized that [[cancer]] growth is caused by tumor cells generating [[energy]] (as, e.g., [[adenosine triphosphate]]/ATP) mainly by anaerobic breakdown of [[glucose]] (known as [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]], or [[anaerobic respiration]]). This is in contrast to healthy cells, which generate energy mainly from [[aerobic respiration|oxidative breakdown]] of [[pyruvate]]. Pyruvate is an end product of [[glycolysis]] and is [[oxidized]] within the [[mitochondria]]. Hence, according to Warburg, cancer should be interpreted as a [[mitochondrial]] dysfunction.

{{quote|Cancer, above all other diseases, has countless secondary causes. But, even for cancer, there is only one prime cause.

Warburg continued to develop the hypothesis experimentally and gave several prominent lectures outlining the theory and the data.<ref name="origin">{{Cite journal | last1 = Warburg | first1 = O. | title = On the Origin of Cancer Cells | doi = 10.1126/science.123.3191.309 | journal = Science | volume = 123 | issue = 3191 | pages = 309–314 | year = 1956 | pmid =  13298683| bibcode = 1956Sci...123..309W }}</ref>

Today, [[mutations]] in [[oncogenes]] and [[tumor suppressor genes]] are thought to be responsible for [[malignant transformation]], and the [[Warburg effect (oncology)|metabolic changes]] Warburg [[Warburg hypothesis|thought of as causative]] are now considered to be a result of these mutations.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bertram|first1=JS|title=The molecular biology of cancer.|journal=Molecular Aspects of Medicine|date=December 2000|volume=21|issue=6|pages=167–223|pmid=11173079|doi=10.1016/s0098-2997(00)00007-8}}</ref>

A recent reevaluation of the data from nuclear/cytoplasm transfer experiments, where nuclei from cancer cells are placed in normal cytoplasm and where nuclei from normal cells are placed in cancer cytoplasm, support the role of metabolism in cancer and the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] in aiding tumor suppression.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Seyfried|first1=Thomas N.|last2=Flores|first2=Roberto E.|last3=Poff|first3=Angela M.|last4=D’Agostino|first4=Dominic P.|date=March 2014|title=Cancer as a metabolic disease: implications for novel therapeutics|journal=Carcinogenesis|volume=35|issue=3|pages=515–527|doi=10.1093/carcin/bgt480|issn=0143-3334|pmc=3941741|pmid=24343361}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seyfried|first=Thomas T.N.|date=July 2015|title=Cancer as a mitochondrial metabolic disease|pmc=4493566|journal=Frontiers in Cell and Developmental Biology|volume=3|pages=43|via=PMC|pmid=26217661|doi=10.3389/fcell.2015.00043}}</ref> Still, as evident from the references therein, this promising phenomenon still fails to explain the origin of cancer as Warburg originally proposed.

==Later years==
{{more citations needed section|date=November 2015}}
[[File:Warburg-tomb.JPG|thumb|180px|Warburg's grave in Berlin, [[Cemetery Dahlem]]]]
Otto Warburg edited and had much of his original work published in ''The Metabolism of Tumours'' (tr. 1931) and wrote ''New Methods of Cell Physiology'' (1962). An unabashed [[anglophile]], Otto Warburg was thrilled when [[Oxford University]] awarded him an honorary doctorate.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} He was awarded the Order ''[[Pour le Mérite]]'' in 1952 and was known to tell other universities not to bother with honorary doctorates. He would ask officials to mail him medals he had been awarded so as to avoid a ceremony that would separate him from his beloved laboratory.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

When frustrated by the lack of acceptance of his ideas, Warburg was known to quote an aphorism he attributed to [[Max Planck]]: "Science advances one funeral at a time".<ref>[http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/show/111818 Max Planck > Quotes > Quotable Quote]. goodreads.com</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FpgzBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT86 | title=Light in Shaping Life: Biophotons in Biology and Medicine | author=van Wijk, Roeland | year=2014 | pages=86 | isbn=978-90-818843-2-7}}</ref>

Seemingly utterly convinced of the accuracy of his conclusions, Warburg expressed dismay at the "continual discovery of cancer agents and cancer viruses" that he expected to "hinder necessary preventive measures and thereby become responsible for cancer cases".<ref name="origin"/>

When [[Josef Issels]] was tried and convicted for promoting the [[Issels treatment]], an ineffective regimen claimed to treat cancer, Warburg offered to testify on Issels' behalf at his appeal to the German Supreme Court. All of Issels' convictions were overturned.<ref name="Issels">[[Otto Heinrich Warburg#refIssels1981|Issels]].</ref>

Warburg never married and resided in [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society|the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] with his faithful companion, Jacob Heiss, a personal friend and the secretary and manager of [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society|the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]].  Warburg pursued his research until the age of 86.

In 1968, he suffered a broken [[femur]]. This was complicated by [[deep vein thrombosis]]. He died in 1970 from [[pulmonary embolism]] and was buried in a Christian cemetery.<ref>{{Cite journal| title=suffered a broken femur, complicated by deep vein thrombosis, and in 1970, Otto Heinrich Warburg died from a pulmonary embolism; from Google (otto warburg died) result 3| journal=Rambam Maimonides Medical Journal| volume=6| issue=1| pages=e0008| pmc=4327324| year=2015| last1=Weisz| first1=G.

==The Otto Warburg Medal==
The [[Otto Warburg Medal]] is intended to commemorate Warburg's outstanding achievements. It has been awarded by the German Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (''Gesellschaft für Biochemie und Molekularbiologie'') since 1963. The prize honors and encourages pioneering achievements in fundamental biochemical and molecular biological research. The Otto Warburg Medal is regarded as the highest award in Germany for biochemists and molecular biologists. It has been endowed with prize money, sponsored by the publishing company Elsevier/BBA.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.elsevier.com/awards/global/the-otto-warburg-medal | title = The Otto Warburg Medal | publisher = elsevier.com| access-date = 2014-07-03}}</ref>
