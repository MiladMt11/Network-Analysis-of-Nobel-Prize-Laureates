'''Ferid Murad''' (born September 14, 1936) is an American [[physician]] and [[pharmacologist]], and a co-winner of the 1998 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]. He is married to Carol A. Murad with whom he has five children and nine grandchildren.

== Early life ==
Murad was born in [[Whiting, Indiana]]. His parents were Henrietta Josephine Bowman of [[Alton, Illinois]] and Jabir Murat Ejupi, an Albanian immigrant<ref name="Bio">{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1998/murad/biographical/|title=Ferid Murad – Biographical|date=6 November 2021|work=NobelPrize.org. Nobel Prize Outreach AB 2021|accessdate=7 November 2021}}</ref> who subsequently changed his name to John Murad after being processed at [[Ellis Island]] in 1913. His mother was from a [[Baptists|Baptist]] family and ran away from home in 1935, aged 17, to marry his father, who was 39 and [[Islam|Muslim]].<ref name="Bio" /> Murad is the oldest of three boys; his brothers are John Abderhaman and Turhon Allen. Murad and his brothers were raised as [[Catholicism|Catholics]]. He was later baptized an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]] while in college. The family owned a small restaurant while Murad was growing up, and he spend his youth working at the family business.<ref name="Bio" />  

In the eighth grade, he was asked to write an essay of his top three career choices, which he indicated as physician, teacher and pharmacist (in 1948, clinical pharmacology was not yet a discipline in medicine). As of today, he is a board-certified physician and internist doing both basic and clinical research with considerable teaching in medicine, pharmacology and clinical pharmacology and with a PhD in pharmacology.

==Education==

Murad competed successfully for a Rector Scholarship at [[DePauw University]] in [[Greencastle, Indiana]], a small and excellent liberal arts university on a tuition scholarship. He received his undergraduate degree in chemistry from the [[Pre-medical|pre-med]] program at [[DePauw University]] in 1958. During his senior year of college he began to apply to medical schools when his faculty advisor Forst Fuller, a professor in the biology department suggested that he consider a new MD-PhD program at [[Case Western Reserve University]]. A fraternity brother, Bill Sutherland, also advised that he consider this new combined degree program that his father [[Earl Sutherland, Jr]] initiated in Cleveland in 1957. The program paid full tuition for both degrees and provided a modest stipend of $2000 per year. Murad ultimately decided to attend and became an early graduate of the first explicit [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] and [[pharmacology]] [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] program (which would later lead to the development of the prestigious [[Medical Scientist Training Program]]) obtaining his degrees from [[Case Western Reserve University]] in 1965. He was an Intern in Internal Medicine at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] (1965–66), Resident in Internal Medicine (1966–67), Clinical Associate and Senior Assistant Surgeon, Public Health Service, [[National Heart and Lung Institute]] (1967–69) and Senior Staff Fellow there from 1969-70. 

==Career==

He began his academic career by joining the [[University of Virginia]], where he was made associate professor, Depts. of Internal Medicine and Pharmacology, School of Medicine in 1970, before becoming a full Professor in 1975. From 1971-81 he was Director, Clinical Research Center, UVA School of Medicine and Director, Division of Clinical Pharmacology, Dept. of Internal Medicine, UVA School of Medicine (1973–81). Murad moved to [[Stanford University]] in 1981 where he was Chief of Medicine at the Palo Alto VA Medical Center (1981–86), Associate Chairman, Dept. of Medicine, Stanford University (1984–86), and Acting Chairman, Dept. of Medicine and Acting Division Chief, Division of Respiratory Medicine from 1986-88. In 1988 he was the [[American Heart Association]], Ciba Award Recipient. Murad left his tenure at Stanford in 1988 for a position at [[Abbott Laboratories]], where he served as a Vice President of Pharmaceutical Discovery until founding his own biotechnology company, the Molecular Geriatrics Corporation, in 1993. Murad went back to academics and joined the [[University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston|University of Texas Medical School at Houston]] to create a new department of integrative biology, pharmacology, and physiology in 1997. There, he was the chairman of Integrative Biology and Pharmacology, Professor and Director Emeritus of The Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine for the Prevention of Human Disease, John S. Dunn Distinguished Chair in Physiology and Medicine, Deputy director of The Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine, and later a Professor at the Brown Foundation Institute of Molecular Medicine. In April 2011, he moved to the [[George Washington University]] as a Professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.<ref>[http://gwtoday.gwu.edu/learningresearch/nobellaureatetojoingw/ Nobel Laureate to Join GW | Learning & Search] George Washington University</ref>

Murad's key research demonstrated that [[nitroglycerin]] and related drugs worked by releasing [[nitric oxide]] into the body, which relaxed smooth muscle by elevating intracellular cyclic GMP. The missing steps in the signaling process were filled in by [[Robert F. Furchgott]] and [[Louis J. Ignarro]] of [[UCLA]], for which the three shared the 1998 Nobel Prize (and for which Murad and Furchgott received the [[Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research]] in 1996). In 1999, Murad and [[Robert F. Furchgott|Furchgott]] received the Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Golden Plate Awardees of the American Academy of Achievement |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://achievement.org/our-history/golden-plate-awards/#science-exploration}}</ref> He is also a member of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] among other notable societies.

In 2015, Murad signed the [[Mainau Declaration|Mainau Declaration 2015 on Climate Change]] on the final day of the 65th [[Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings|Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting]]. The declaration was signed by a total of 76 Nobel Laureates and handed to then-President of the French Republic, [[François Hollande]], as part of the successful [[Paris Climate Change Conference|COP21 climate summit]] in Paris.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mainaudeclaration.org/|title=Mainau Declaration|website=www.mainaudeclaration.org|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref>
