'''Charles Brenton Huggins''' (September 22, 1901 – January 12, 1997) was a Canadian-American physician, physiologist and cancer researcher at the [[University of Chicago]] specializing in [[prostate cancer]].<ref>{{citation |last=Altman |first=Lawrence K. |title= C.

==Early life and education==
Huggins was born in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], Canada. He graduated from [[Acadia University]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree in 1920. He went on to study medicine at [[Harvard Medical School]] and received his [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] degree in 1924.  He served his internship and residency in general surgery with [[Frederick A. Coller]] at the [[University of Michigan]].<ref name=Michigan>{{cite web|title=Charles B.

==Work==
Huggins established a method to measure the effect [[hormone]] changes have on prostatic function. He found out that [[castration]] or [[estrogen]] administration led to glandular [[atrophy]], which could be reversed by re-administration of androgen. In 1941 the beneficial effect of androgen ablation on [[metastatic]] prostate cancer was realised when Huggins and Clarence Hodges treated patients by either castration or estrogen therapy. They monitored the prostate size and therapeutic efficacy by measuring serum [[prostatic acid phosphatase]] levels and concluded that androgenic activity in the body influences prostate cancer, at least with respect to serum phosphatase. Huggins was the first to use a systemic approach to treat prostate cancer.

In 1958, Huggins received the [[Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh]]. He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] on October 13, 1966.<ref name="Denmeade">{{cite journal|last=Denmeade|first=SR|author2=Isaacs, JT|title=A history of prostate cancer treatment.|journal=Nature Reviews.

Huggins died 1997 in [[Chicago, Illinois]] at the age of 95 years. His wife died in 1983.
