==Biography==
Born in [[Bristol]], he was educated at [[Blundell's School]] and graduated from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] as third [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]] in the mathematics [[tripos]] before turning to [[physiology]]. While still an undergraduate at Trinity College, he derived in 1909<ref name="hill1909">{{Cite journal

In this paper, Hill's first publication, he derived both the equilibrium form of the Langmuir equation, and also the exponential approach to equilibrium. The paper, written under the supervision of [[John Newport Langley]], is a landmark in the history of [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] theory, because the context for the derivation was the binding of nicotine and curare to the "receptive substance" at the [[neuromuscular junction]].

While a student he had enrolled in the [[Officers Training Corps]]; he was a crack shot. In 1914, at the outbreak of the [[First World War]], Hill became the musketry officer of the [[Cambridgeshire Regiment]]. The British made no effort to make use of their scientists.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Van der Kloot |first1=William |title=Mirrors and Smoke: A. V. HILL, His Brigands, and the Science of Anti-Aircraft Gunnery in World War I |journal=Notes Rec. R. Soc. Lond. |date=2011 |volume=25 |pages=393–410 |url=http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/65/4/393}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Van der Kloot |first1=William |title=Great Scientists wage the Great War |date=2014 |publisher=Fonthill |location=Stroud |pages=191–214}}</ref> At the end of 1915, while home on leave he was asked by [[Horace Darwin]] from the [[Minister of Munitions|Ministry of Munitions]] to come for a day to advise them on how to train anti-aircraft gunners. On site, Hill immediately proposed a simple two mirror method to determine airplanes' heights. Transferred to Munitions, he realized that the mirrors could measure where smoke shells burst and if he fitted this data with the [[ballistics|equations]] describing a shell's flight they could provide accurate range tables for anti-aircraft guns. To measure and compute he assembled the [[Anti-Aircraft Experimental Section]], a team of men too old for conscription, [[Ralph H. Fowler]] (a wounded officer), and lads too young for service including [[Douglas Hartree]], [[Arthur Milne]] and [[James Crowther]]. Someone dubbed his motley group "Hill's Brigands", which they proudly adopted. Later in the war they also worked on locating enemy planes from their sound. He sped between their working sites on his beloved motorcycle. At the end of the war Major Hill issued certificates to more than one hundred Brigands. He was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] (OBE).

In 1923 he succeeded [[Ernest Starling]] as professor of physiology at [[University College London]], a few years later becoming a Royal Society Research professor there, where he remained until retirement in 1951. In 1933, he became with [[William Beveridge]] and [[Lord Rutherford]] a founder member and vice-president of the [[Council for Assisting Refugee Academics|Academic Assistance Council]] (which in 1936 became the Society for the Protection of Science and Learning). By the start of the [[Second World War]], the organisation had saved 900 academics (18 of whom went on to win Nobel Prizes) from [[Nazi]] persecution. He prominently displayed in his laboratory a toy figure of Adolf Hitler with saluting arm upraised, which he explained was in gratitude for all the scientists Germany had expelled, some of whom were now working with him.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Jean Medawar|author2=David Pyke|title=Hitler's gift: scientists who fled Nazi Germany |date=2001 |publisher=Piatkus |location=London |page=122}}</ref> Hill believed that "Laughter is the best detergent for nonsense".<ref>Van der Kloot 2014, p. 202.</ref>

In 1935 he served with [[Patrick Blackett, Baron Blackett|Patrick Blackett]] and Sir [[Henry Tizard]] on the committee that gave birth to [[radar]]. He was also biological secretary of the Royal Society; [[William Henry Bragg]] was president. Both had been frustrated by the delay in putting scientists to work in the previous war. The Royal Society collated a list of scientists and Hill represented the Society at the Ministry of Labour. When the war came Hill led a campaign to liberate refugee scientists who had been interned. He served as an [[independent (politician)|independent]] Member of Parliament (MP) for [[Cambridge University (UK Parliament constituency)|Cambridge University]] from 1940 to 1945. In 1940 he was posted to the British Embassy in Washington to promote war research in the still neutral United States. He was authorized to swap secrets with the Americans, but this could not work: how do you place a value on another's secret? Hill saw the answer and persuaded the British to show the Americans everything they were working on (except for the atomic bomb). The mobilization of Allied scientists was one of the major successes in the war.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hastings |first1=Max |title=All Hell let loose: the World at War 1939-45 |date=2011 |publisher=Harper |location=London |page=81}}</ref>

After the war he rebuilt his laboratory at University College and vigorously carried on research.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hill |first1=A. V. |title=Trails and Trials in Physiology|date=1965|publisher=Edward Arnold|location=London}}</ref> In 1951 his advocacy was rewarded by the establishment of a Biophysics Department under his leadership. In 1952 he became head of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] and Secretary General of the [[International Council of Scientific Unions]]. He was President of the [[Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom|Marine Biological Association]] from 1955 to 1960. In 1967 he retired to Cambridge where he gradually lost the use of his legs. He died "held in the greatest affection by more than a hundred scientific descendants all over the world".<ref>Katz 1978. p. 133.</ref>

== Cooperativity of protein binding and enzyme kinetics ==
Although Hill's work in muscle physiology is probably the most important, and certainly responsible for his Nobel Prize, he is also very well known in biochemistry for the ''Hill equation'', which he used to quantify binding of oxygen to haemoglobin, written here as a kinetic equation, as it is mainly used for that:<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Srinivasan|first=Bharath|date=2021-07-16|title=A Guide to the Michaelis‐Menten equation: Steady state and beyond|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/febs.16124|journal=The FEBS Journal|language=en|pages=febs.16124|doi=10.1111/febs.16124|issn=1742-464X|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite book

:<math>v = V\frac{a^h}{K_{0.5}^h + a^h}</math>

Here <math>v</math> is the rate of reaction at concentration <math>a</math> of substrate, <math>V</math> is the rate at saturation,  <math>{K_{0.5}}</math> is the value of <math>a</math> that gives <math>v = 0.5 V</math>, and the exponent <math>h</math> is a parameter that expresses the degree of departure from Michaelis-Menten kinetics: ''positive cooperativity'' for <math>h>1</math>, no cooperativity for <math>h=1</math>, and ''negative cooperativity'' for <math>h<1</math>.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Srinivasan|first=Bharath|date=2020-10-08|title=Explicit Treatment of Non Michaelis-Menten and Atypical Kinetics in Early Drug Discovery|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.20944/preprints202010.0179.v1|access-date=2021-04-19|website=dx.doi.org}}</ref> Note that there is no implication that <math>h</math> is an integer, and in most experimental cases, apart from the trivial case of <math>h=1</math>, it is not. Although many authors use <math>h</math> or <math>{n_\mathrm{H}}</math> rather than  <math>h</math> these symbols are misleading if taken to imply that it shows the number of binding sites on the protein. Hill himself avoided any such interpretation.

The equation can be rearranged as follows:

:<math> \ln [v/(V-v )] = h \ln a -  h \ln K_{0.5} </math>

This shows that when the Hill equation is accurately obeyed (which usually it is not) a plot of <math> \ln  [v/(V-v)] </math> gives a straight line of slope <math>h</math>. This is called a ''Hill plot''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Srinivasan|first=Bharath|date=2020-09-27|title=Words of advice: teaching enzyme kinetics|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/febs.15537|journal=The FEBS Journal|volume=288|issue=7|pages=2068–2083|doi=10.1111/febs.15537|issn=1742-464X|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

== Muscle physiology ==
Hill made many exacting measurements of the heat released when skeletal muscles contract and relax. A key finding was that heat is produced during contraction, which requires investment of chemical energy, but not during relaxation, which is passive.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Katz |first1=Bernard |title=Archibald Vivian Hill |journal=Bio. Mem. Fel. Roy. Soc.|date=1978|volume=24|pages=71–149}}</ref> His earliest measurements used equipment left behind by the Swedish physiologist [[Magnus Blix]], Hill measured a temperature rise of only 0.003&nbsp;°C. After publication he learned that German physiologists had already reported on heat and muscle contraction and he went to Germany to learn more about their work. He continually improved his apparatus to make it more sensitive and to reduce the time lag between the heat released by the preparation and its recording by his [[thermocouple]]. 
 
Hill is regarded, along with [[Hermann Helmholtz]], as one of the founders of biophysics.

Hill returned briefly to Cambridge in 1919 before taking the chair in physiology at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] in 1920 in succession to [[William Stirling (physiologist)|William Stirling]]. Using himself as the subject {{mdash}}he ran every morning from 7:15 to 10:30 {{mdash}} he showed that running a dash relies on energy stores which afterwards are replenished by [[Excess post-exercise oxygen consumption|increased oxygen consumption]]. Paralleling the work of German [[Otto Fritz Meyerhof]], Hill elucidated the processes whereby mechanical work is produced in muscles. The two shared the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine for this work.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1922/hill-facts.html | title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1922}}</ref> Hill introduced the concepts of [[VO2 max|maximal oxygen uptake]] and oxygen debt in 1922.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hale|first=Tudor|date=2008-02-15|title=History of developments in sport and exercise physiology: A.

==Personal life==
In 1913 he married [[Margaret Hill (social reformer)|Margaret Neville Keynes]] (1885-1974), daughter of the economist [[John Neville Keynes]], and sister of the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] and the surgeon [[Geoffrey Keynes]]. They had two sons and two daughters:

* [[Polly Hill (economist)|Polly Hill]] (1914–2005), economist, married K.A.C. Humphreys, registrar of the West African Examinations Council.

==Blue plaque==
[[File:A. V. HILL 1886–1977 Physiologist lived here 1923 – 1967.jpg|thumb|Blue plaque at 16 Bishopswood Road, Highgate.]]
On 9 September 2015 an [[English Heritage]] [[Blue plaque]] was erected at Hill's former home, 16 Bishopswood Road, [[Highgate]], where he had lived from 1923 to 1967. Since then the house had been divided into flats and owned by [[Highgate School]], where Hill was a Governor from 1929 to 1960. It has now been sold, redeveloped and renamed as Hurstbourne. In Hill's time, according to his grandson [[Nicholas Humphrey]], regular guests at the house included 18 exiled Nobel laureates, his brother-in-law, the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]], and friends [[Stephen Hawking]] and [[Sigmund Freud]]. After-dinner conversations in the drawing room would inevitably involve passionate debates about science or politics. "Every Sunday we would have to attend a tea party at grandpa’s house and apart from entertaining some extraordinary guests, he would devise some great games for us, such as frog racing in the garden or looking through the lens of a (dissected) sheep’s eye". Sir [[Ralph Kohn]] [[Royal Society|FRS]] who proposed the Blue plaque, said: "The Nobel Prize winner A. V. Hill contributed vastly to our understanding of muscle physiology.  His work has resulted in wide-ranging application in sports medicine. As an outstanding Humanitarian and Parliamentarian, he was uncompromising in his condemnation of the Nazi regime for its persecution of scientists and others. A. V. Hill played a crucial role in assisting and rescuing many refugees to continue their work in this country".<ref>{{cite web|title=A.V.Hill, Nobel Prize Winner and Sports Medicine Pioneer, receives English Heritage Blue Plaque|url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/about-us/search-news/av_hill_blue_plaque|access-date=8 October 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Rowlinson|first1=Liz|title=Houses stamped with a mark of prestige|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/life/property/article4559654.ece|access-date=8 October 2015|work=Times online|date=18 September 2015|url-access=subscription }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Jacoby |first1=Charlie |title=Famous homes in north London with many stories |url=https://www.thejc.com/property/property-features/famous-homes-in-north-london-with-many-stories-1.68206 |website=The JC |access-date=3 June 2020}}</ref>
