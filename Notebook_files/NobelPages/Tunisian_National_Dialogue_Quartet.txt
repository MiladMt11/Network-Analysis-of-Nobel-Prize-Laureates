The '''Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]]: الرباعي التونسي للحوار الوطني‎, [[French language|French]]: ''Quartet du dialogue national'') is a group of four [[civil society]] organizations that were central mediators in the effort to consolidate [[Democratization|democratic gains]] and to form a lasting [[Tunisian Constitution of 2014|constitutional settlement]] in [[Tunisia]] following the unrest and historic regime change of the 2011 [[Tunisian Revolution|Jasmine Revolution]].<sup>[[Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet#cite note-1|[1]]]</sup>

==Tunisian civil society in context==
Following the self-immolation of [[Mohamed Bouazizi]] in [[Sidi Bouzid]] in mid-December 2010, Tunisia was beset by [[Tunisian revolution|proliferating protest movements]]. The movement was initially catalyzed by rural middle-class workers and youths in the region of Sidi Bouzid, from where Bouazizi hailed, but grew to include diverse swaths of the population.

It was never obvious that Tunisian unions would bolster protest efforts. Since independence, the [[Tunisian General Labour Union|Tunisian General Labor Union]] (UGTT) had been politically active, notably in protesting [[International Monetary Fund|IMF]]-imposed cuts to subsidies, but had increasingly been repressed by the [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali|Ben Ali]] regime.  Events such as the 1978 "Black Thursday" protest in response to consumer price hikes and wage stagnation and the 1985 protests due to further IMF cuts to subsidies and skyrocketing cost of living seemed unlikely to be replicated in Ben Ali's more repressive climate.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Workers and Thieves: Labor Movements and Popular Uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt|last=Benin|first=Joel|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0804798044|location=Palo Alto|pages=49}}</ref> At the height of this repressive period, the [[Tunisian Human Rights League]] had been the lone advocacy [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] formally acknowledged.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Workers and thieves : labor movements and popular uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt|last=Beinin|first=Joel|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780804798044|location=Palo Alto|pages=63|oclc=936010139}}</ref> According to the 2011 [[Arab Barometer]] Survey, only three percent of the sample claimed union participation in contrast to Egypt, which had 10 percent of the protesting population holding union affiliation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Beissinger|first1=Mark|last2=Jamal|first2=Amaney|last3=Mazur|first3=Kevin|date=October 2015|title=Explaining Divergent Revolutionary Coalitions: Regime Strategies and the Structuring ofParticipation in the Tunisian and Egyptian Revolutions|journal=Comparative Politics|volume=48|issue=1|page=9|doi=10.5129/001041515816075132|jstor=43664167}}</ref>

Despite this, UGTT's reach had been such during the Ben Ali regime that membership exceeded 800,000 with 150 field offices across the state; identification with the union was often seen as synonymous with party opposition.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Confluency (tarafud) between trade unionism, culture and revolution in Tunisia|last=Omri|first=Mohamed-Salah|publisher=The Tunisian General Union of Labour|year=2016|isbn=9789938143744|pages=31|oclc=1049180857}}</ref> Protest participation steadily increased leading up to December 2010. In 2006 and 2007 alone, 100,000 Tunisians went on strike when Prime Minister Nazif reduced all state worker pay, whereas from 1996 to 2004, no more than 50,000 protested each year.<ref>Beinin, Joel (2016).

[[Tunisian General Labour Union|UGTT]], responding to perceived failure to mobilize workers during the 2008 [[Gafsa]] Riots, was able to successfully navigate the [[Tunisian Revolution]] to its advantage.<ref name=":032">{{cite book|title=Tunisia: An Arab Anomaly|last1=Masri|first1=Safwan|date=September 2017|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231179508|edition=First|location=New York City|page=60}}</ref> UGTT responded to Bouazizi's self-immolation by calling a strike in Sidi Bouzid and formulating plans for strikes in outer-lying districts.<ref>{{cite book|title=Tunisia: An Arab Anomaly|last1=Masri|first1=Safwan|date=September 2017|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231179508|edition=First|location=New York City|page=41}}</ref>  Mouldi Jendoubi, deputy secretary-general of the [[Tunisian General Labour Union|UGTT]], quickly mobilized further strike efforts and eventually called a general strike on 14 January.<ref name=":12">{{cite book|title=Tunisia: An Arab Anomaly|last1=Masri|first1=Safwan|date=September 2017|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231179508|edition=First|location=New York City|page=66}}</ref>

Converse to the missed opportunity of 2008, UGTT had leveraged its institutional position and historical proximity to the Ben Ali regime to its advantage. The UGTT had assumed a vanguard position for the protest movement and would be a key player in any negotiations to follow.{{fact|date=October 2020}}

== Background to formation ==
Despite Ben Ali's departure, the ruling [[Troika (Tunisia)|Troika]] led by Islamist party Ennahda proved unable to strike a lasting constitutional settlement in the [[Constituent Assembly of Tunisia]]. Only having won 89 of 217 parliamentary seats, Ennahda was forced into a tripartite coalition, joining secular parties [[Congress for the Republic|CPR]] and [[Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberties|Ettakatol]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tunisia: An Arab Anomaly|last=Masri|first=Safwan|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780231179508|location=New York City|pages=59}}</ref> However, the alliance was tenuous, and Ennahda was accused of attempting to impose an Islamist juridical order on the state.<ref name=":032"/> On 20 March 2012, protests were held in response to Ennahda's proposed constitutional provisions that would have codified Islam as the official religion of the state. Ennahda had also made clear that women were to be placed in a "complementary" legal position, and not deserving of formal equality.<ref name=":322">{{Cite book|title=Civil Society and Gender Relations in Authoritarian and Hybrid Regimes: New Theoretical Approaches and Empirical Case Studies|last1=Wilde|first1=Gabriele|last2=Sandhaus|first2=Jasmin|publisher=Verlag Barbara Budrich|year=2018|isbn=9783847407294|edition=1|pages=174|jstor=j.ctvdf01h0}}</ref> Secularists feared that this legal language would have enabled a path to the future incorporation of sharia law.<ref name=":032" />

==Initial activities==
As early as 18 June 2012, [[Tunisian General Labour Union|UGTT]] had been calling for [[Ennahda Movement|Ennahda]], [[Nidaa Tounes]], and other relevant parties to come to the table for a convention centered around the constitution and electoral regulations.<ref name=":42">{{Citation|last=Yousfi|first=Hèla|title=Trade Unions and Arab Revolutions: the Tunisian Case of UGTT|date=2017-08-07|pages=197|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781315313610|doi=10.4324/9781315313610-5}}</ref>  At this stage in the transition, UGTT was still largely viewed as being beholden to partisan interests, particularly opposition parties decrying Ennahda-led Islamist reform.<ref name=":42" />  To this end, UGTT deputy secretary Samir Cheffi had gone on national television on 30 May to assert that the organization would remain in its impartial role in seeking a settlement among all parties.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Trade unions and Arab revolutions : the Tunisian case of UGTT|last=Yousfi|first=Hela|publisher=Routledge|year=2018|isbn=9781138232051|location=New York City|pages=169|oclc=1044516053}}</ref>

Following this, on 18 June 2012 UGTT announced a "political initiative" seeking national reconciliation. The initiative politically was troubled from its inception as Ennahda sought to exclude centrist party [[Nidaa Tounes]] from any negotiation process. In addition, the looming specter of a general strike called by UGTT should Ennahda refuse to comply did not bode well for fruitful discussion.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Trade Unions and Arab Revolutions: the Tunisian Case of UGTT|last=Yousfi|first=Hèla|date=2017-08-07|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781315313610|location=New York|pages=198|doi=10.4324/9781315313610}}</ref> Ennahda had historically been excluded from such unionist campaigns, with Islamist representation in the UGTT having been sparse and Islamist advocates having been silent during Tunisia's period of structural adjustment in the 1980s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Trade Unions and Arab Revolutions: the Tunisian Case of UGTT|last=Yousfi|first=Hèla|date=2017-08-07|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781315313610|location=New York City|pages=170|doi=10.4324/9781315313610}}</ref>

The general strike leveraged by UGTT would have mobilized at least 500,000 unionists and thereby brought the Tunisian economy grounding to a halt.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Fabric of Peace in Africa : Looking beyond the State.|last1=Aall|first1=Pamela|last2=Crocker|first2=Chester|publisher=MQUP|year=2017|isbn=9781928096429|pages=196|oclc=987101809}}</ref> It then became apparent that Ennahda and CPR would require other civil society actors to be brought in should the "political initiative" launched by UGTT amount to a more robust national reconciliation.<ref>Yousfi, Hela (2017). ''Trade unions and Arab revolutions : the Tunisian case of UGTT''. Routledge. p.&nbsp;198. {{ISBN|9781138232051}}. {{OCLC|1044516053}}.</ref>

Following a series of internal meetings, UGTT emerged decisively to provide overtures to three distinct national civil society organizations, the [[Tunisian Confederation of Industry, Trade and Handicrafts]], or UTICA, the [[Tunisian Human Rights League]], and the [[Tunisian Order of Lawyers]]. In October 2012, the organizations convened, with all parties but Ennahda and CPR represented.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Civil society and Gender Relations in Authoritarian and Hybrid Regimes : New Theoretical Approaches and Empirical Case Studies|last1=Wilde|first1=Gabriele|last2=Zimmer|first2=Annette|last3=Obuch|first3=Katharina|last4=Panreck|first4=Isabelle-Christine|publisher=Verlag Barbara Budrich|year=2018|isbn=9783847407294|pages=174|oclc=1055202039}}</ref> The involvement of the Tunisian Union for Industry, or UTICA, was particularly key to the construction of the quartet as they had signed a "Social Contract" with UGTT on 14 January 2013.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Confluency (tarafud) between trade unionism, culture and revolution in Tunisia|last=Omri|first=Mohamed-Salah|date=2016|publisher=The Tunisian General Union of Labour|isbn=9789938143744|pages=37|oclc=1049180857}}</ref> This contract evinced that UGTT was willing to work hand-in-hand with the historic representatives of Tunisian corporate interests — representing key employers and business interests across the state.<ref name=":52">{{Cite book|title=Trade Unions and Arab Revolutions: The Tunisian Case of UGTT|last=Yousfi|first=Hèla|date=2017-08-07|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781315313610|location=New York City|pages=201|doi = 10.4324/9781315313610}}</ref> Such unions are not without precedent in Tunisian civil society, as [[Tunisian Confederation of Industry, Trade and Handicrafts|UTICA]] and UGTT had come together in 1956 in concert with Bourguiba's [[Neo Destour]] to create a broad-based appeal for the nascent government.<ref name=":52" /> Moreover, the inclusion of the Order of Lawyers and the Human Rights League supplied added weight to legitimating the arbitration mandate UGTT sought for the Quartet. The Human Rights League had been in close alignment with the Ben Ali regime with many Ennahda supporters working within its ranks, so its inclusion further bolstered the credentials of the Quartet.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tunisia's 2013 National Dialogue: Political Crisis Management National Dialogue Handbook.

Despite these initial political initiatives, a number of high-profile political assassinations threatened to collapse the foundation of the new regime.

== Political crisis ==
{{Main|2013–14 Tunisian political crisis}}
The murder of opposition leaders Chokri [[Chokri Belaid|Belaid]], leader of [[Democratic Patriots' Unified Party|Watad]], and Mohamed Brahmi, founder of the party [[People's Movement (Tunisia)|Mouvement du Peuple]], catalyzed a new wave of protests that threatened to halt the proceedings of the [[Constituent Assembly of Tunisia|Constituent Assembly]]. In particular, Brahmi's assassination was viewed as a blow to the constitutional process as a number of opposition parties withdrew from the Constituent Assembly altogether.<ref name=":23">{{Cite book|title=Tunisia: An Arab Anomaly|last=Masri|first=Safwan|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780231179508|location=New York City|pages=65}}</ref> As an immediate result of Brahmi's murder, a secular opposition coalition, the [[National Salvation Front (Tunisia)|National Salvation Front]], organized a month-long series of protests in July 2013, culminating in calls for Ennahda to step down.<ref name=":23"/> A particular locus of the movement was the [[Bardo National Museum (Tunis)|Bardo National Museum]], where protesters gathered and broadcast calls for government resignation. Calls were made for the government to "[[The Rough Guide to Arabic Revolution|irhal]]" or "leave" in Arabic, similar to calls made during the Egyptian uprising.<ref name=":23"/>

Ansar Sharia, an [[Islamism|Islamist]] group operating primarily in Libya, was seen as responsible for the assassination of [[Mohamed Brahmi|Brahmi]], and the Troika correspondingly seen as not taking any retaliatory measures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crisisgroup.org/middle-east-north-africa/north-africa/tunisia/tunisia-s-national-dialogue-quartet-set-powerful-example|title=Tunisia's National Dialogue Quartet Set a Powerful Example|last=El Amrani|first=Issandr|date=2015-10-10|website=Crisis Group|language=en|access-date=2019-04-01}}</ref> The [[Tamarrod Movement|Tamarod Movement]] in Egypt, formed of disparate civil society and political opposition groups, seemed a natural analog to what National Salvation Front activists in Tunisia saw as the correct course of action in deposing the Islamist government.<ref name=":23"/>  Their proximity to the [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali|Ben Ali]] regime and the largest corporate firms, role in organizing a number of general strikes, and institutional make-up enabled the UGTT to initiate proceedings.<ref name=":16">{{cite book|title=Tunisia: An Arab Anomaly|last1=Masri|first1=Safwan|date=September 2017|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=9780231179508|edition=First|location=New York City|page=66|jstor=10.7312/masr17950|doi=10.7312/masr17950}}</ref>

== Dialogue process ==

Following the assassinations of opposition leader [[Chokri Belaid|Belaïd]] in February 2013, UGTT sought to formalize the dialogue structure.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|jstor=j.ctvdf01h0|title=Civil Society and Gender Relations in Authoritarian and Hybrid Regimes: New Theoretical Approaches and Empirical Case Studies|last1=Wilde|first1=Gabriele|last2=Sandhaus|first2=Jasmin|publisher=Verlag Barbara Budrich|year=2018|isbn=9783847407294|edition=1|pages=174}}</ref> However, as accusations of Ennahda's potential involvement in [[Chokri Belaid|Belaïd's]] assassination continued, UGTT refused to participate in the second forum convened by Interim President [[Moncef Marzouki]].<ref name=":3" /> Following this blow, the second assassination of a prominent opposition figure, that of secular leader Mohamed [[Mohamed Brahmi|Brahmi]] on 25 July 2013 seemed to preclude any further constitutional debate or national dialogue.<ref name=":6">{{Cite book|title=Civil society and gender relations in authoritarian and hybrid regimes : new theoretical approaches and empirical case studies|last=Wilde, Gabriele, editor.|year=2018|isbn=9783847407294|pages=175|oclc=1055202039}}</ref> UGTT seized on this moment by calling a two-day general strike, and according to Ian Hartshorn, were able to mobilize around 50 percent of their membership.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hartshorn|first=Ian M.|date=1 March 2017|title=Organized Interests in Constitutional Assemblies|journal=Political Research Quarterly|volume=70|issue=2|pages=414|doi=10.1177/1065912917695190|s2cid=157167970|issn=1065-9129}}</ref> The seat of the [[Constituent Assembly of Tunisia|Constituent Assembly]], Bardo Palace, began to immediately draw in thousands of protesters.<ref name=":7">{{Cite book|title=Tunisia's 2013 National Dialogue: Political Crisis Management National Dialogue Handbook.

Therefore, it was only through a third national dialogue convention, convened on 25 October 2013 that any lasting settlement was built.<ref name=":6" /> At the outset, the UGTT-led coalition made clear that they sought an apolitical government divorced from the extremism they viewed Ennahda as supplying to Tunisian national politics. In this vein, of the 24 parties invited to the National Dialogue in October 2013, 21 signed a "roadmap" outlining the general aims of the convention.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Trade Unions and Arab Revolutions|last=Yousfi|first=Hèla|date=2017-08-07|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781315313610|location=New York City|pages=199|doi = 10.4324/9781315313610}}</ref> They sought:

# To appoint an interim president to see Tunisia through the reconciliation process
# To establish regulations and a timeline for presidential and legislative elections
# To introduce an impartial electoral commission
# To finish, approve, and deliver the constitution to the [[Constituent Assembly of Tunisia|Tunisian Constituent Assembly]] for ratification<ref>{{Cite book|title=The fabric of peace in Africa : looking beyond the state|last=Aall, Pamela, Herausgeber.

As argued by Hèla Yousfi in ''Trade Unions and Arab Revolutions: The Tunisian Case of UGTT'' two "guiding principles" emerged to steer the course of the National Dialogue: that of technocratic, apolitical governance to see Tunisia through the transition, and an immediate halt to all state violence and terror threats.<ref name=":52"/> Following the assassinations, parties were inclined to avert totalizing political crisis by agreeing to interim governance. In particular, Houcine [[Houcine Abassi|Abassi]], Secretary-General of UGTT, was able to move the process forward at critical junctures and willing to use the elevated bargaining power of the now four-strong coalition to push political parties along the path to constitutional ratification.<ref name=":82" /> As reported in Helen Yousfi's work which collected various interviews from those involved in the Dialogue, Abassi was willing to "require representatives from political parties to stay in the room after the meeting if no decision had been made."<ref name=":82">{{Cite book|title=Trade Unions and Arab Revolutions: the Tunisian Case of UGTT|last=Yousfi|first=Hèla|date=2017-08-07|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781315313610|location=New York City|pages=202|doi = 10.4324/9781315313610}}</ref>

UTICA and UGTT's insistence on a "unity front" further ensured the success of the Quartet. Reflected in statements by UGTT officials and UTICA president Ouided [[Wided Bouchamaoui|Bouchamaoui]], opening up Tunisia to foreign investment was a key development the Quartet hoped to achieve.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Trade Unions and Arab Revolutions|last=Yousfi|first=Hèla|date=2017-08-07|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781315313610|pages=203|doi = 10.4324/9781315313610}}</ref> While hardline UGTT officials did not share this view, the contingent represented in the Quartet's ability to form a historic pact with UTICA cemented the Quartet's capacity to dominate mediation.<ref name=":0" />

Both legislative and presidential elections were scheduled as a result of the Dialogue process.<ref name=":113">{{Cite book|title=Workers and Thieves: Labor Movements and Popular Uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt|last=Benin|first=Joel|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2016|isbn=978-0804798044|location=Palo Alto|pages=131}}</ref> The legislative elections saw [[Nidaa Tounes]], the dominant party of the [[National Salvation Front (Tunisia)|National Salvation Front]] coalition, win a plurality of seats in the [[Assembly of the Representatives of the People|Assembly of the Representatives]] on [[2014 Tunisian parliamentary election|October 26, 2014]].<ref name=":113"/> Additionally, on 24 November 2014, Nidaa Tounes leader [[Beji Caid Essebsi|Essebsi]] defeated [[Moncef Marzouki|Marzouki]], CPR leader and willing participant in the now-dissolved Troika.<ref name=":113"/>

== International response and aid ==
The international community widely supported the transition process in Tunisia and provided economic aid through various channels. In particular, the United States and European Union provided impetus for the completion of the Dialogue process by intervening at critical junctures to ensure Ennahda's compliance  by way of leveraging economic support.<ref name=":16"/> It became clear that IMF and World Bank support for the regime would only come by way of the Troika's resignation and further cooperation with the Dialogue process.<ref name=":16" />

A number of financial efforts have been put in place to bolster the continued growth of Tunisian democracy since the Dialogue. Beyond continued [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]] and [[European Union|EU]] support, Tunisia 2020, a forum that courted international and private donors from over 70 countries accrued $14 billion worth of aid to continue growing the economy, bolstering job creation, and enshrining democratic norms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/opinion/14-billion-could-keep-tunisia-path-democracy|title=The $14 billion that could keep Tunisia on the path of democracy|website=Middle East Eye|language=en|access-date=2019-04-27}}</ref> Notably, the European Investment Bank and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development each provided loans worth 3.1 and 1.5 billion, respectively.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tunisia-economy-investment-idUSKBN13N1KC|title=Regional partners pledge billions in help for Tunisia|date=2016-11-29|work=Reuters|access-date=2019-04-27|language=en}}</ref> In a 17 December 2017 interview with the United Nations, UTICA leader during the Quartet and Nobel Prize recipient, Ouided [[Wided Bouchamaoui|Bouchamaoui]], echoed this pro-investment sentiment. Bouchamaoui urged for further liberalization to attract foreign capital:<blockquote>"A number of laws need to be revised. The slow pace of the administration is discouraging investors. Foreign investors are not very motivated because they feel that existing laws are either not clear or not applied."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.unesco.org/courier/2017-october-december/ouided-bouchamaoui-prosperity-springs-trust|title=Ouided Bouchamaoui: "Prosperity springs from trust"|date=2017-10-18|website=UNESCO|language=en|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref></blockquote>In the Quartet's official speech given upon receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, they similarly made calls for foreign investment into the state. They recognized that while the Quartet was able to establish frameworks for governance and electoral pluralism, the state continues to face challenges regarding youth unemployment and vocational prospects:<blockquote>"...we have to create the conditions that ensure the return of the Tunisian economy to its normal state, and improve the overall climate for investment, and embark on approving the necessary repairs, with extensive consultation between the Government and the economic and social players, to preserve the interests of all groups and factions."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2015/tndq/26109-nobel-lecture-2015-3/|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 2015|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-13}}</ref></blockquote>

== Critiques of the quartet ==
While the process was widely hailed by international observers and non-governmental organizations, the actual National Dialogue was decried by more fervent unionists as betraying elements of the Tunisian working poor. In particular, the inclusion of UTICA, at a juncture when Tunisians were embattled in a fight for wage increases, seemed to certain union activists and working class as reneging on its duty to its membership.<ref name=":82"/>

Another critique that has often been put forth regarding the Quartet is that it enabled further foreign investment, donor aid, and international economic support at a time when Tunisia was seeking wholesale independence. When the ANC had been suspended in September 2013 and protests were widespread, often centered around Bardo palace, the IMF decided to withhold a loan package of $1.7 billion. It was only following the accession of Jomaa leading the interim government that $500 million of the loan package was provided.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tunisia's 2013 National Dialogue: Political Crisis Management National Dialogue Handbook.

Certain historians have offered critiques that despite the Quartet's ability to bring political actors to the table, the UGTT and UTICA have been unable to push for economic restructuring. Even though these unions enjoyed a privileged position during the transition, critics such as Joel Benin view the economic structure of the state as unchanged.<ref name=":02">{{Cite book|title=Workers and Thieves: Labor Movements and Popular Uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt|last=Benin|first=Joel|publisher=Stanford University|year=2016|isbn=978-0804798044|location=Palo Alto|pages=133}}</ref> The Foreign Investment Promotion Agency of Tunisia has largely been immune from opposition organizing.<ref name=":02" /> While critics acknowledge "a new public discourse," the September 2014 Invest in Tunisia Conference evinced an economic climate amenable to IMF and World Bank aid packages.<ref name=":02" />

The Quartet has also been criticized for the elite, technocratic transition bodies it constructed. Certain observers have drawn comparisons between the transition bodies erected in 2011 to oversee the national elections and the bodies created for the drafting of the 2014 constitution. Like the High Authority for Realization of the Objectives of the Revolution, Political Reform and Democratic Transition formed in 2011 to consolidate democratic gains, the Quartet has been viewed as "taking control against the will of the people" through an elite-driven process.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Trade unions and Arab revolutions : the Tunisian case of UGTT|last=Yousfi|first=Hela|publisher=Routledge|year=2017|isbn=9781138232051|pages=206|oclc=1044516053}}</ref>

== Institutional legacy ==
The [[Tunisian General Labour Union|UGTT]] had secured a number of key labor victories in the language of the new constitution. This was in stark contrast to the high degree of control the Ben Ali regime had exercised over civil society and the highly limited mobilization of union workers under the auspices of UGTT. In the [[2014 Constitution of Tunisia|2014 constitution]], UGTT, working within the Quartet, was able to secure the right to strike and the right to form new unions without constraints.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Hartshorn|first=Ian M.|date=1 March 2017|title=Organized Interests in Constitutional Assemblies: Egypt and Tunisia in Comparison|journal=Political Research Quarterly|language=en|volume=70|issue=2|pages=415|doi=10.1177/1065912917695190|s2cid=157167970|issn=1065-9129}}</ref> Before the newly ratified constitution, the 1994 labor statute governing the capacity of the UGTT had precluded any strike activity that threatened vital industry.<ref name=":1" /> In this way, the success of the National Dialogue enabled the most labor-friendly constitution in Tunisia's history and displayed the UGTT's institutional capacity to arbitrate a national political dispute on the highest stage.<ref name=":1" />

A major component of the 2014 constitution were provisions that ensured for transparency in future Tunisian governance, primarily achieved by way of Article 125 which established an anti-corruption government organ.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tunisia : An Arab Anomaly|last=Masri, Safwan M., author.|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780231545020|location=New York City|pages=62|oclc=1054872924}}</ref> In line with this normative shift, in June 2015 Prime Minister [[Habib Essid]] established a National Council of Social Dialogue, composed of representatives from government, UGTT, and UTICA.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://allafrica.com/stories/201506040827.html|title=Tunisia: Cabinet Meeting Approves Draft Law On Creation of National Council of Social Dialogue|last=Tunis Afrique Pressé|date=3 June 2015|website=allafrica.com}}</ref> All three partners praised this tripartite arrangement as "the guarantee of a permanent, regular and comprehensive tripartite dialogue."<ref name=":4" />

== Pacted transition ==
Political scientists have noted the high degree of involvement between civil society elites, the [[Troika (Tunisia)|Troika]], and the opposition during the Transition and post-uprising period. Certain observers have viewed the Dialogue an example of pacted transition.<ref name=":133">{{Cite journal|last1=Holmes|first1=Amy Austin|last2=Koehler|first2=Kevin|date=2018-07-30|title=Myths of military defection in Egypt and Tunisia|journal=Mediterranean Politics|volume=25|pages=45–70|doi=10.1080/13629395.2018.1499216|s2cid=158209796|issn=1362-9395}}</ref>

Pacted transitions occur when a state is undergoing a period of democratic consolidation and divergent elites can agree upon a shared trajectory governed by common rules. These rules often include a pledge to avoid violence, to work within existing institutions, and to demobilize popular unrest. South Africa's early 1990s [[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|transition]] often serves as the paradigmatic example. While such transitions are contingent on regime type, role of the military, and pre-existing institutions, Tunisia's elite-centered Dialogue has been thought to meet the definition.<ref name=":133" /> Gary A. Stradiotto and Sujian Guo define constituent pacts as "a negotiating unit, {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} incumbent and opposition groups, attempting to bargain the transition away from authoritarian rule to democracy."<ref name=":152">{{Cite book|title=Democratic transitions : modes and outcomes|last=Stradiotto, Gary A., author.|publisher=International Journal of World Peace|year=2010|isbn=9781138683556|pages=7|oclc=936411468}}</ref>  The National Dialogue process fits this description as both opposition parties, the ruling Troika, and civil society mediators intervened to construct a common path. Certain scholars, however, have noted stark differences with traditional conceptions of pacted transitions and the Tunisian case.<ref>Stradiotto, Gary A., author. (2010). ''Democratic transitions : modes and outcomes''. International Journal of World Peace. p.&nbsp;7. {{ISBN|9781138683556}}. {{OCLC|936411468}}.</ref>

A. A. Holmes and K. Koehler argue that unlike [[Terry Karl|Terry Karl's]] traditional formulation, continued protests and the high polarization that met [[Ennahda Movement|Ennahda's]] governance is evidence that the ruling Troika did not demobilize public unrest.<ref name=":133" /> This is apparent in UGTT's continued threat to mobilize strikes throughout the Dialogue process, such as that in [[Tozeur|Toezur]] in December 2013.<ref name=":113"/> In addition, Holmes and Koelher note that the assassinations of [[Chokri Belaid|Belaid]] and [[Mohamed Brahmi|Brahmi]], along with a massive surge in [[Constituent Assembly of Tunisia|Constituent Assembly]] resignations from the opposition are evidence that elites often failed to find common ground on transition procedure.<ref name=":142">{{Cite journal|last1=Holmes|first1=Amy Austin|last2=Koehler|first2=Kevin|date=2018-07-30|title=Myths of military defection in Egypt and Tunisia|journal=Mediterranean Politics|volume=25|pages=45–70|doi=10.1080/13629395.2018.1499216|s2cid=158209796|issn=1362-9395}}</ref> Polarization in Tunisia between Islamists and secularists saw a surge between 2011-2013, in which over 60 percent of secularists claimed to have no trust for Tunisian Islamists.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Holmes|first1=Amy Austin|last2=Koehler|first2=Kevin|date=2018-07-30|title=Myths of military defection in Egypt and Tunisia|journal=Mediterranean Politics|volume=25|pages=45–70|doi=10.1080/13629395.2018.1499216|s2cid=158209796|issn=1362-9395}}</ref> Polarization became such that the [[National Salvation Front (Tunisia)|National Salvation Front]] included in its coalition in July 2013 a Tunisian [[Tamarod demonstrations|Tamarod]] Movement, of which its analog in Egypt was calling for President [[Mohamed Morsi|Mohamed Morsi's]] deposition.<ref name=":142" /> These events have been cited by political scientists in critiquing the labeling of the Tunisian transition as "pacted." The polarization, continuation of protest during the Quartet's process, and continued threat of elite defection all pose definitional concerns in terming it a pacted transition per Karl's formulation.<ref name=":152" />
