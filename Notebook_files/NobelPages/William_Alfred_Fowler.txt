'''William Alfred Fowler''' (August 9, 1911 &ndash; March 14, 1995) was an [[United States|American]] nuclear physicist, later [[astrophysicist]], who, with [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]] won the 1983 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]. He is known for his theoretical and experimental research into nuclear reactions within stars and the energy elements produced in the process<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Scientists, Revised Edition|url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaworl00oake|url-access=limited|last=Oakes|first=Elizabeth|publisher=Facts on File, Inc.|year=2007|isbn=9780816061587|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaworl00oake/page/n261 245]}}</ref> and was one of the authors of the influential [[B2FH paper|B<sup>2</sup>FH paper]].

==Early life==
On August 9, 1911, Fowler was born in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Fowler's parents were  John MacLeod Fowler and Jennie Summers Watson. Fowler was the eldest of his siblings, Arthur and Nelda.<ref name="geni_fowler"/><ref name=":0" />

The family moved to [[Lima, Ohio|Lima]], [[Ohio]], a steam railroad town, when Fowler was two years old. Growing up near the Pennsylvania Railway Yard influenced Fowler's interest in locomotives. Later in 1973, he would travel to the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] just to observe the steam engine that powered the [[Trans-Siberian Railway|Trans Siberian Railway]] plying the nearly 2,500-kilometer route that connects [[Khabarovsk]] and [[Moscow]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Century of Ideas: Perspectives from Leading Scientists of the 20th Century|url=https://archive.org/details/centuryideaspers00sidh_266|url-access=limited|last=Sidharth|first=B.

==Education==
In 1933, Fowler graduated from the [[Ohio State University]], where he was a member of the [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity. In 1936, Fowler received a Ph.D. in [[nuclear physics]] from the [[California Institute of Technology]] in [[Pasadena, California]].<ref name="columbia_fowler">{{cite web |url=https://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/the-vetlesen-prize/past-recipients/william-alfred-fowler |title=William Alfred Fowler Biography |publisher=ldeo.columbia.edu |access-date=July 21, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=American Scientists|last=Carey, Jr.|first=Charles|publisher=Facts on File, Inc.|year=2006|isbn=0816054991|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/americanscientis0000care/page/120 120]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/americanscientis0000care/page/120}}</ref>

==Career==
In 1936, Fowler became a research fellow at Caltech. In 1939, Fowler became an assistant professor at Caltech.<ref name="columbia_fowler"/>

Although an experimental nuclear physicist, Fowler's most famous paper was "[[Synthesis of the Elements in Stars]]", coauthored with Cambridge cosmologist [[Fred Hoyle]] and in collaboration with two young Cambridge astronomers, [[E. Margaret Burbidge]] and [[Geoffrey Burbidge]].  That 1957 paper in Reviews of Modern Physics<ref>

In 1942, Fowler became an associate professor at Caltech. In 1946, Fowler became a Professor at Caltech.

Fowler succeeded [[Charles Christian Lauritsen|Charles Lauritsen]] as director of the Kellogg Radiation Laboratory at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], and was himself later succeeded by [[Steven E. Koonin]]. Fowler was awarded the National Medal of Science by President Gerald Ford.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/ces/astro/NucleoArchive/PhotoList/1970s/75WAF_Pres.html|title=Photo Archive in Nuclear Astrophysics}}</ref>

Fowler won the [[Henry Norris Russell Lectureship]] of the [[American Astronomical Society]] in 1963, the [[Vetlesen Prize]] in 1973, the [[Eddington Medal]] in 1978, the [[Bruce Medal]] of the [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] in 1979, and the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1983 for his theoretical and experimental studies of the [[nuclear reaction]]s of importance in the formation of the chemical elements in the universe (shared with [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.phys-astro.sonoma.edu/BruceMedalists/FowlerW/index.html|title=The Bruce Medalists: William A.

Fowler's doctoral students at Caltech included [[Donald D. Clayton]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Personal life==
A lifelong fan of [[steam locomotive]]s, Fowler owned several working models of various sizes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/ces/astro/NucleoArchive/PhotoList/1970s/71Train.html|title=Photo Archive in Nuclear Astrophysics}}</ref>

Fowler's first wife was Adriane Fay (née Olmsted) Fowler (1912–1988). They had two daughters, Mary Emily and Martha.<ref name="geni_fowler"/><ref name="sunjournal_fowlerwife"/>

In December 1989, Fowler married Mary Dutcher (1919–2019), an artist, in Pasadena, California.<ref name="geni_fowler"/><ref name="sunjournal_fowlerwife">{{cite web |url=https://www.sunjournal.com/2019/07/13/obituarymary-dutcher-fowler/ |title=Obituary: Mary Ditcher Fowler |publisher=sunjournal.com |date=July 13, 2019 |access-date=July 21, 2019}}</ref>
