'''George Catlett Marshall Jr.''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|GCB}} (December 31, 1880 – October 16, 1959) was an American soldier and statesman. He rose through the [[United States Army]] to become [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Chief of Staff]] under presidents [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Harry S. Truman]], then served as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] and [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] under Truman.{{sfn|Historical Office}} [[Winston Churchill]] lauded Marshall as the "organizer of victory" for his leadership of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory in [[World War II]]. After the war, he spent a frustrating year trying and failing to avoid the impending [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] in China. As Secretary of State, Marshall advocated a U.S. economic and political commitment to post-war European recovery, including the [[Marshall Plan]] that bore his name. In recognition of this work, he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1953.{{sfn|CNN: George C. Marshall}}

Born in [[Pennsylvania]], Marshall graduated from the [[Virginia Military Institute]] (VMI) in 1901. Marshall received his commission as a second lieutenant of Infantry in February 1902 and immediately went to the Philippines. He served in the United States and overseas in positions of increasing rank and responsibility, including platoon leader and company commander in the Philippines during the [[Philippine–American War]]. He was the Honor Graduate of his Infantry-Cavalry School Course in 1907, and graduated first in his 1908 [[United States Army Command and General Staff College|Army Staff College]] class. In 1916 Marshall was assigned as [[aide-de-camp]] to [[J. Franklin Bell]], the commander of the [[Department of the West|Western Department]]. After the nation entered [[World War I]] in 1917, Marshall served with Bell who commanded the [[Department of the East]]. He was assigned to the staff of the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Division]], and assisted with the organization's mobilization and training in the United States, as well as planning of its combat operations in [[France]]. Subsequently, assigned to the staff of the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] headquarters, he was a key planner of American operations including the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]].

After the war, Marshall became an [[aide-de-camp]] to [[John J. Pershing]], who was then the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army's Chief of Staff]]. Marshall later served on the Army staff, was the executive officer of the [[15th Infantry Regiment (United States)|15th Infantry Regiment]] in China, and was an instructor at the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]]. In 1927, he became assistant commandant of the Army's [[United States Army Infantry School|Infantry School]], where he modernized command and staff processes, which proved to be of major benefit during [[World War II]]. In 1932 and 1933 he commanded the [[8th Infantry Regiment (United States)|8th Infantry Regiment]] and [[Tybee Island, Georgia|Fort Screven]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Marshall commanded 5th Brigade, [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]] and [[Vancouver Barracks]] from 1936 to 1938, and received promotion to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]]. During this command, Marshall was also responsible for 35 [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] (CCC) camps in Oregon and southern Washington. In July 1938, Marshall was assigned to the War Plans Division on the War Department staff, and later became the Army's [[Deputy Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Deputy Chief of Staff]]. When Chief of Staff [[Malin Craig]] retired in 1939, Marshall became acting Chief of Staff, and then Chief of Staff, a position he held until the war's end in 1945.

As Chief of Staff, Marshall organized the largest military expansion in U.S. history, and received promotion to [[five-star rank]] as [[General of the Army (United States)#World War II era|General of the Army]]. Marshall coordinated Allied operations in Europe and the Pacific until the end of the war. In addition to accolades from Churchill and other Allied leaders, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named Marshall its [[Time Magazine Person of the Year|Man of the Year]] for 1943 and 1947.{{sfn|Person of Year Photo|2006}} Marshall retired from active service in 1945, but remained on active duty, as required for holders of five-star rank.{{sfn|Wedemeyer}} From December 15, 1945 to January 1947, Marshall served as a special envoy to China in an unsuccessful effort to negotiate a coalition government between the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] under [[Mao Zedong]].

As [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] from 1947 to 1949, Marshall advocated rebuilding Europe, a program that became known as the Marshall Plan, and which led to his being awarded the 1953 Nobel Peace Prize.{{sfn|Del Testa|Lemoine|Strickland|2001|p=120}} After resigning as Secretary of State, Marshall served as chairman of the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]]{{sfn|Marshall Is Named Head|1949|p=6}} and president of the [[American National Red Cross]]. As [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] at the start of the [[Korean War]], Marshall worked to restore the military's confidence and morale at the end of its post-World War II demobilization and then its initial buildup for combat in Korea and operations during the [[Cold War]]. After resigning as Defense Secretary, Marshall retired to his home in [[Virginia]]. He died in 1959 and was buried with honors at [[Arlington National Cemetery]].

==Early life and education==
George Catlett Marshall Jr. was born in [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania]], the youngest of three children born to George Catlett Marshall and Laura Emily (née Bradford) Marshall.{{sfn|George Catlett Marshall Timeline}}{{sfn|Zajac|2003}} Both sides of his family were long from [[Kentucky]], but cherished their [[Virginia]]n roots.{{sfn|Unger|Unger|Hirshson|2014 |p= 2}}{{efn-ua|In an interview late in his life, when asked whether he regarded himself a Virginian, he answered: 'My family are Kentucky. I myself was the only member of the family born up north... I married two Virginians, very ardent Virginians, and I went to school in a very ardent, historical Virginia section school. I might say also that I pay taxes in Virginia" {{harv|Unger|Unger|Hirshson|2014 |p= 5''n''}}}} He was also a first cousin, three times removed, of former [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Marshall]].{{sfn|Higginbotham|1985|p=106}} Marshall's father was active in the coal and [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] business.{{sfn|Zajac|2003}} Later, when asked about his political allegiances, Marshall often joked that his father had been a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and his mother a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], whereas he was an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]].{{sfn|Stoler|2015}}

Marshall was educated at Miss Alcinda Thompson's private school in Uniontown and spent a year at Uniontown's Central School.{{sfn|Zajac|2003}} Having decided early in life that he desired a career in the military, but unlikely to obtain an appointment to the [[United States Military Academy]] because of his average grades, he looked to the Virginia Military Institute (VMI) for a formal education.{{sfn|Cray|1990|pp=23–24}} Marshall's brother Stuart, a VMI alumnus, believed George would not succeed and argued that their mother should not let George attend out of concern that he would "disgrace the family name."{{sfn|Early Career}} Determined to "wipe his brother's face," Marshall enrolled at the age of sixteen in December 1897.{{sfn|George Catlett Marshall Timeline}}{{sfn|National Portrait Gallery: Marshall children}} To pay for his tuition and expenses, Marshall's mother sold parcels of land she owned in Uniontown and [[Augusta, Kentucky]].{{sfn|Cray|1990|pp=23–24}}

[[File:1900 VMI Keydets football team marshall encircled.jpg|thumb|left|[[1900 VMI Keydets football team]]. Marshall circled]]
At the start of his college career, Marshall was subjected to a [[hazing]] incident in which upperclassmen positioned an unsheathed bayonet with the point up and directed him to squat over it.{{sfn|Behrman|2007|p=10}} After twenty minutes, Marshall fainted and fell.{{sfn|Behrman|2007|page=10}} When he awoke, he had a deep laceration to one of his buttocks.{{sfn|Behrman|2007|page=10}} While being treated for his injury, Marshall refused to inform on his classmates.{{sfn|Behrman|2007|page=10}} Impressed with his bravery, the hazers never bothered him again.{{sfn|Behrman|2007|page=10}}

During his years at VMI, Marshall always ranked first in military discipline and about midway academically.{{sfn|George Catlett Marshall Timeline}} He attained the rank of first captain, the highest a cadet could achieve, and graduated 15th of 34 in the Class of 1901.{{sfn|George Catlett Marshall Timeline}}{{sfn|Taylor|2020|p=2}}{{sfn|Skutt|1997|p=86}} Marshall received a diploma, not a degree.{{sfn|Skutt|1997|p=86}} At the time of his graduation, the top five or six VMI graduates received bachelor's degrees.{{sfn|Skutt|1997|p=86}} The rest received diplomas attesting to their status as graduates.{{sfn|Skutt|1997|p=86}} He played [[Tackle (gridiron football position)|offensive tackle]] on the [[Gridiron football|football]] team and [[1900 College Football All-Southern Team|in 1900]] he was selected for [[College Football All-Southern Team|All-Southern]] honors.{{sfn|Stevens|Williams|2009|p=123}}

==Early infantry career and the Philippines==
Following his graduation from VMI, Marshall served as Commandant of Students at the [[Danville Community College|Danville Military Institute]] in [[Danville, Virginia]].{{sfn|Pops|2009|p=307}} He took a competitive examination for a commission in the United States Army, which had greatly expanded to deal with the [[Spanish–American War]] and [[Philippine–American War]].{{sfn|Willbanks|2013|p=23}} Marshall passed, and used endorsements his father obtained from both of Pennsylvania's U.S. Senators to bolster his application.{{sfn|Willbanks|2013|p=23}} VMI Superintendent [[Scott Shipp]] also supported Marshall's application, and in a letter to President [[William McKinley]] compared him favorably to other VMI graduates serving in the Army, saying Marshall was "Fully the equal of the best."{{sfn|GCM Foundation|1996|p=18}} He was commissioned a [[Second lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] of [[Infantry Branch (United States)|Infantry]] in February 1902.{{sfn|Willbanks|2013|p=23}} In a matter of days he married, resigned the Danville job, and shipped out to serve with the [[30th Infantry Regiment (United States)|30th Infantry Regiment]] in the [[Philippines]].{{sfn|Willbanks|2013|p=23}}{{sfn|Stoler|1989|pp= 13–14}}

Prior to [[World War I]], Marshall received various postings in the United States and the Philippines, including serving as an infantry platoon leader and company commander during the [[Philippine–American War]] and other guerrilla uprisings.{{sfn|George Catlett Marshall Timeline}} He was schooled in modern warfare, including a tour at [[Fort Leavenworth]], Kansas from 1906 to 1910 as both a student and an instructor.{{sfn|Stoler |1989|pages=21-25}} He was the Honor Graduate of his Infantry-Cavalry School Course in 1907, and graduated first in his 1908 [[United States Army Command and General Staff College|Army Staff College]] class.{{sfn|George Catlett Marshall Timeline}}

After another tour of duty in the Philippines, Marshall returned in 1916 to serve as [[aide-de-camp]] to the commander of the Western Department, former Army chief of staff Major General [[J. Franklin Bell]], at the [[Presidio of San Francisco]].{{sfn|Jolemore|1986|p=6}} After the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917, Marshall relocated with Bell to [[Governors Island]], New York when Bell was reassigned as commander of the [[Department of the East]].{{sfn|Zabecki|Mastriano|2020|p=115}} Shortly afterwards, Marshall was assigned to help oversee the mobilization of the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Division]] for service in France.{{sfn|George Catlett Marshall Timeline}}

==World War I==
[[File:Colonel George Marshall.tif|thumb|Colonel Marshall in France in 1919]]

During [[World War I]], Marshall had roles as a planner of both training and operations. In the summer of 1917, he was assigned as assistant chief of staff for operations on the staff of the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Division]].{{sfn|George Catlett Marshall Timeline}} After overseeing the division's mobilization and organization in Texas, he departed for France with the division staff in mid-1917.{{sfn|George Catlett Marshall Timeline}} On the long ocean voyage, his roommate was the division's assistant chief of staff for training, [[Lesley J. McNair]];{{sfn|Calhoun|2012|p=43}} the two formed a personal and professional bond that they maintained for the rest of their careers.{{sfn|Calhoun|2012|p=43}}

After arriving in France, Marshall served with the 1st Division on the St. Mihiel, Picardy, and Cantigny fronts.{{sfn|George Catlett Marshall Timeline}} In late 1917, John J. Pershing, the commander of the [[American Expeditionary Force]], inspected the 1st Division.{{sfn|Willbanks|2013|p=29}} Unimpressed by what he observed, Pershing began to berate division commander [[William L. Sibert]] in front of Sibert's staff.{{sfn|Willbanks|2013|p=29}} Sibert took Pershing's criticism in silence, but when Pershing turned his attention to the division chief of staff, Marshall angrily interceded to inform Pershing of logistical and administrative difficulties of which Pershing was unaware.{{sfn|Runkle|2017}} Marshall also informed Pershing that the AEF staff had not been very helpful in dealing with the problems.{{sfn|Willbanks|2013|p=29}} The division commander and staff were concerned that Marshall's willingness to confront Pershing had probably cost him his career.{{sfn|Willbanks|2013|p=29}} Instead, Pershing began to seek out Marshall and ask for his advice.{{sfn|Willbanks|2013|p=29}}

Marshall won recognition and acclaim for his planning of the [[Battle of Cantigny]], which took place from May 28 to 31, 1918;{{sfn|George Catlett Marshall Timeline}} Marshall's success resulted in the first notable American victory of the war.{{sfn|Davenport|2015}} As he conducted pre-attack planning, Marshall traveled alone under cover of darkness to personally view the terrain and mentally map it.{{sfn|Marshall's Silver Star}} Marshall ventured beyond the front lines and far into no-man’s land, often under friendly artillery fire and routinely risking discovery and capture by German troops.{{sfn|Marshall's Silver Star}} On May 26, he was injured while traveling to several subordinate units to conduct pre-attack coordination.{{sfn|Marshall|1976|p= 93}}  As he departed the division headquarters area, his horse stumbled, fell, and rolled over;{{sfn|Marshall|1976|page=93}} Marshall's left foot was caught in the stirrup, and he sustained a severe sprain and bruise.{{sfn|Marshall|1976|page=93}} A physician bound Marshall's injured ankle and foot with adhesive tape so he could avoid medical evacuation and remain with the division to oversee the attack.{{sfn|Marshall|1976|pages=93–94}} In 1920, Marshall was awarded the [[Citation Star]] for his heroism during this battle.{{sfn|Marshall's Silver Star}} When the [[Silver Star]] medal was created in 1932, Citation Stars were converted to the new award.{{sfn|Marshall's Silver Star}}{{sfn|Plampin|1963|p=xiv}}{{efn-ua|Marshall's Silver Star citation reads: "he was Assistant Chief of Staff for Operations at the First Division Headquarters from June 8, 1917 to July 6, 1918. By his superior professional attainments, his tactical skill, his sound judgment, and his courageous conduct in obtaining information through personal visits to the most exposed lines, he contributed in a determining manner to the training, morale, and operations of the Division in the Toul Sector, the Cantigny Sector, and the movement for the offensive at Soissons."{{sfn|Marshall's Silver Star}}}}

In mid-1918, Pershing brought Marshall on to the AEF operations staff, G-3, where he worked closely with Pershing and was a key planner of American operations.{{sfn|George Catlett Marshall Timeline}} He was instrumental in the planning and coordination of the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]], which contributed to the defeat of the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in 1918.{{sfn|Lengel|2008}} Marshall held the permanent rank of [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]] and the temporary rank of [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]].{{sfn|Tucker|Roberts|2006|p=1186}} He was recommended for promotion to temporary [[brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in October 1918, but the Armistice occurred before the recommendation was acted on.{{sfn|Tucker|Roberts|2006|p=1186}} After the Armistice, Marshall served as chief of staff for the [[VIII Corps (United States)|U.S. Eighth Corps]].{{sfn|George Catlett Marshall Timeline}}

==Between the wars==
After the war, Marshall reverted to his permanent rank of captain.{{sfn|Tucker|Roberts|2006|p=1186}} In 1919, he became an [[aide-de-camp]] to [[General (United States)|General]] Pershing.{{sfn|George Catlett Marshall Timeline}} Between 1920 and 1924, while Pershing was [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]], Marshall worked on a number of projects that focused on training and teaching modern, mechanized warfare. He taught at the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]] and was a key planner in the [[United States Department of War|War Department]].{{sfn|George Catlett Marshall Timeline}} He then served as executive officer of the [[15th Infantry Regiment (United States)|15th Infantry Regiment]] in China, where he remained for three years and learned to speak basic Mandarin.{{sfn|George Catlett Marshall Timeline}} In 1927, as a [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]], he was appointed assistant commandant of the [[United States Army Infantry School|Infantry School]] at [[Fort Benning]], where he initiated major changes to modernize command and staff processes, which proved to be of major benefit during [[World War II]].{{sfn|George Catlett Marshall Timeline}} Marshall placed [[Edwin F. Harding]] in charge of the Infantry School's publications, and Harding became editor{{sfn|Campbell|2008|pp=41, 400}} of ''Infantry in Battle'', a book that codified the lessons of World War I. ''Infantry in Battle'' is still used as an officer's training manual in the Infantry Officer's Course and was the training manual for most of the infantry officers and leaders of World War II.

While stationed at Fort Benning, Marshall met [[Katherine Tupper Marshall|Katherine Tupper Brown]] at a dinner party in 1928.{{sfn|Early Career}} They married on October 15, 1930 at Emmanuel Episcopal Church in Baltimore, Maryland.{{sfn|Santoro|1999|p=49}} The wedding made headlines as General Pershing served as Marshall's best man.<ref>{{cite news |date=October 16, 1930 |title=Col.

From June 1932 to June 1933, Marshall was the commanding officer of the [[8th Infantry Regiment (United States)|8th Infantry Regiment]] at [[Tybee Island, Georgia|Fort Screven]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].{{sfn|George Catlett Marshall Timeline}} From July 1933 to October 1933 he was commander of [[Fort Moultrie]], South Carolina and District I of the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]], and he was promoted to colonel in September 1933.{{sfn|George Catlett Marshall Timeline}} He was senior instructor and chief of staff for the Illinois National Guard's [[33rd Infantry Division (United States)|33rd Division]] from November 1933 to August 1936.{{sfn|George Catlett Marshall Timeline}}

[[File:George C. Marshall cph.3a44773.jpg|thumb|upright|Brigadier General Marshall in 1938]]
Marshall commanded the 5th Brigade of the [[3rd Infantry Division (United States)|3rd Infantry Division]] and [[Vancouver Barracks]] in [[Vancouver, Washington]] from 1936 to 1938, and was promoted to brigadier general in October 1936.{{sfn|George Catlett Marshall Timeline}} In addition to obtaining a long-sought and significant troop command, traditionally viewed as an indispensable step to the pinnacle of the US Army, Marshall was also responsible for 35 Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) camps in Oregon and southern Washington.{{sfn|George Catlett Marshall Timeline}} As post commander Marshall made a concerted effort to cultivate relations with the city of Portland and to enhance the image of the US Army in the region. With the CCC, he initiated a series of measures to improve the morale of the participants and to make the experience beneficial in their later life. He started a newspaper for the CCC region that provided a vehicle to promote CCC successes, and he initiated a variety of programs that developed participants' skills and improved their health. Marshall's inspections of the CCC camps gave him and his wife Katherine the chance to enjoy the beauty of the American northwest and made that assignment what he called "the most instructive service I ever had, and the most interesting."{{sfn|Home}}

In July 1938, Marshall was assigned to the War Plans Division in [[Washington, D.C.]] and subsequently reassigned as Deputy Chief of Staff. In that capacity, then-Brigadier General Marshall attended a White House conference at which President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] proposed a plan to provide aircraft to England in support of the war effort. With all other attendees voicing support, Marshall was the only one to disagree, pointing out the lack of consideration for logistical support or training. Marshall also spoke in favor of a large ground army although Roosevelt had said a large air force would be a greater deterrent to enemies.{{sfn|Roberts|2008|p=26}} Despite others' belief then that Marshall had ended his career, his willingness to express disagreement resulted in Roosevelt nominating Marshall to be the Army Chief of Staff. At the time of the appointment, Marshall was only 34th in seniority, outranked by 21 major generals and 11 brigadier generals, but he was fifth under an unwritten rule that the chief of staff should be able to serve a four-year term before reaching the mandatory retirement age of 64.{{sfn|Roberts|2008|p=27}}

Upon the retirement of General [[Malin Craig]] on July 1, 1939, Marshall became acting chief of staff.{{sfn|Liebling|1940}} Marshall was promoted to [[General (United States)|general]] and sworn in as chief of staff on September 1, 1939, the same day the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]] launched its [[invasion of Poland]].<ref>[http://www.georgecmarshall.org/Meet-General-Marshall/Early-Career George C.

On May 11, 1940 the [[United States Congress]] cut $10 million from a $28 million appropriation budget for equipment to detect Japanese aircraft off the west coast of America. Marshall met with [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] [[Henry Morgenthau Jr.]] and they went to see Roosevelt; Marshall emphasized the supreme importance of getting the full amount and told Roosevelt "you have got to do something and you've got to do it today". Marshall's advocacy worked and he got "all he wanted and more".{{sfn|Roberts|2008|pp=32,33}}

In 1941, Marshall became a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]], raised "at sight" by the [[Grand Master (Freemasonry)|Grand Master]] of the Grand Lodge of the District of Columbia.{{sfn|Stewart|2011}} ("At sight" is the procedure by which a Grand Master confers on a candidate all three Masonic degrees - Apprentice, Fellowcraft, and Master - at one time.){{sfn|Stewart|2011}}

==World War II==

As Chief of Staff, Marshall organized the largest military expansion in U.S. history, inheriting an outmoded, poorly equipped army of 189,000 men and, partly drawing from his experience teaching and developing techniques of modern warfare as an instructor at the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]], coordinated the large-scale expansion and modernization of the U.S. Army. Though he had never actually led troops in combat, Marshall was a skilled organizer with a talent for inspiring other officers.{{sfn|Bland|1988|pp=27–51}} Many of the American generals who were given top commands during the war were either picked or recommended by Marshall, including [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Jacob L. Devers]], [[George S. Patton]], [[Terry de la Mesa Allen Sr.]], [[Lloyd Fredendall]], Lesley McNair, [[Mark Wayne Clark]] and [[Omar Bradley]].{{sfn|Ossad|2003}}
===Expands military force fortyfold===
[[File:Infantry in battle cover.gif|thumb|upright|Cover to the book ''Infantry in Battle'', the World War II officer's guide to infantry combat operations. Marshall directed production of the book, which is still used as a reference today.]]
Faced with the necessity of turning an army of former civilians into a force of over eight million soldiers by 1942 (a fortyfold increase within three years), Marshall directed McNair to focus efforts on rapidly producing large numbers of soldiers. With the exception of airborne forces, Marshall approved McNair's concept of an abbreviated training schedule for men entering Army land forces training, particularly in regard to basic infantry skills, weapons proficiency, and combat tactics.{{sfn|Ambrose|1997|pp=271–84}}{{sfn|Keast|1945}} At the time, most U.S. commanders at lower levels had little or no combat experience of any kind. Without the input of experienced British or Allied combat officers on the nature of modern warfare and enemy tactics, many resorted to formulaic training methods emphasizing static defense and orderly large-scale advances by motorized convoys over improved roads.{{sfn|George|1981|pp= 13–21}} In consequence, Army forces deploying to Africa in [[Operation Torch]] suffered serious initial reverses when encountering German armored combat units in Africa in the [[Battle of Kasserine Pass]] and other major battles.{{sfn|Keast|1945}} Even as late as 1944, U.S. soldiers undergoing stateside training in preparation for deployment against German forces in Europe were not being trained in combat procedures and tactics in use there.{{sfn| Hanford| 2008|p= viii}}
===Replacement system criticized===
[[File:George marshall&henry stimson.jpg|thumb|Army Chief of Staff Marshall with [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry Stimson]]|left]]
Originally, Marshall had planned a 265-division [[Army]] with a system of unit rotation such as practiced by the [[United Kingdom|British]] and other Allies.{{sfn| Vandergriff | 2003}} By mid-1943, however, after pressure from government and business leaders to preserve manpower for industry and agriculture, he had abandoned this plan in favor of a 90-division Army using individual replacements sent via a circuitous process from training to divisions in combat.{{sfn| Vandergriff | 2003}} The individual replacement system devised by Marshall and implemented by McNair exacerbated problems with [[unit cohesion]] and effective transfer of combat experience to new soldiers and officers.{{sfn|Keast|1945}}{{sfn|Ambrose|1997|pp=277–84}} In Europe, where there were few pauses in combat with German forces, the individual replacement system had broken down completely by late 1944.{{sfn|Henry|2001 |pp= 12–14}} Hastily-trained replacements or service personnel reassigned as infantry were often given only a few weeks' refresher training before being thrown into battle with Army divisions locked in front-line combat.

The new men were often not even proficient in the use of their own weapons, and once in combat, could not receive enough practical instruction from veterans before being killed or wounded, sometimes within the first few days.{{sfn|Keast|1945}}{{sfn|Henry|2001 |pp= 12–14}}{{sfn|Ambrose|1997|pp=271–84}} Under such conditions, many soldiers suffered a crippling loss of morale, while veterans were kept at the front until they were killed, wounded, or incapacitated by battle fatigue or illness. Incidents of soldiers going [[AWOL]] from combat duty as well as battle fatigue and self-inflicted injury rose rapidly during the last eight months of the war with Germany.{{sfn|Keast|1945}}{{sfn|Ambrose|1997|pp=277–84}}{{sfn|Henry| 2001 |pp= 12-14}} As one historian concluded, "Had the Germans been given a free hand to devise a replacement system..., one that would do the Americans the most harm and the least good, they could not have done a better job."{{sfn|Henry| 2001 |pp= 12-14}}{{sfn|Ambrose|1997|p=277}}

Marshall's abilities to pick competent field commanders during the early part of the war was decidedly mixed. He was instrumental in advancing the careers of the highly capable generals such as Eisenhower, Bradley, Patton, [[Walter Krueger|Krueger]] and Clark. A notable exception was his recommendation of the swaggering Fredendall to Eisenhower for a major command in the American invasion of North Africa during Operation Torch. Marshall was especially fond of Fredendall, describing him as "one of the best" and remarking in a staff meeting when his name was mentioned, "I like that man; you can see determination all over his face." Eisenhower duly picked him to command the 39,000-man Central Task Force (the largest of three) in Operation Torch. Both men would come to regret that decision, as Fredendall was the leader of U.S. Army forces at the disastrous [[Battle of Kasserine Pass]].{{sfn|Ossad|2003}}

===Planned invasion of Europe===

Marshall with Chief of the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Force]] General [[Henry H. Arnold|Henry "Hap" Arnold]] in England on July 23, 1945.]]
During World War II, Marshall was instrumental in preparing the U.S. Army and [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]] for the invasion of the European continent. Marshall wrote the document that would become the central strategy for all Allied operations in Europe. He initially scheduled [[Operation Overlord]] for April 1, 1943, but met with strong opposition from Winston Churchill, who convinced Roosevelt to commit troops to [[Allied invasion of Sicily]] for the invasion of [[Italy]].{{sfn|D-Day Year Too Late?|2019}} Some authors think that World War II could have ended earlier if Marshall had had his way; others think that such an invasion would have meant utter failure.{{sfn|Perry}}

It was assumed that Marshall would become the Supreme Commander of Operation Overlord, but Roosevelt selected Eisenhower as Supreme Commander. While Marshall enjoyed considerable success in working with Congress and Roosevelt, he refused to lobby for the position. President Roosevelt didn't want to lose his presence in the States. He told Marshall, "I didn't feel I could sleep at ease if you were out of Washington."{{sfn|Buell|John H. Bradley|p=258}} When rumors circulated that the top job would go to Marshall, many critics viewed the potential transfer as a demotion for Marshall, since he would leave his position as Chief of Staff of the Army and lose his seat on the [[Combined Chiefs of Staff]].{{sfn|Pogue}}

On December 16, 1944, Marshall became the first American Army general to be promoted to [[five-star rank]], the newly created [[General of the Army (United States)#World War II era|General of the Army]] – the American equivalent rank to [[field marshal]].{{sfn|Frequently Asked Questions Five-Star}} He was the second American to be promoted to a five-star rank, as [[William Daniel Leahy|William Leahy]] was promoted to [[Fleet Admiral (United States)|fleet admiral]] the previous day.

Throughout the remainder of World War II, Marshall coordinated Allied operations in Europe and the Pacific. He was characterized as the organizer of Allied victory by Winston Churchill. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named Marshall [[Time Magazine Person of the Year|Man of the Year]] for 1943.{{sfn|Person of Year Photo|2006}} Marshall resigned his post of chief of staff on November 18, 1945, but did not retire, as regulations stipulate that Generals of the Army remain on active duty for life. He was succeeded as Army chief of staff by General of the Army Dwight Eisenhower.{{sfn|Wedemeyer}}

==Analysis of Pearl Harbor intelligence failure==
[[File:Photograph of President Truman shaking hands with Secretary of State James F. Byrnes after awarding him the... - NARA - 199180.jpg|thumb|President Truman, Marshall, Secretary of State [[James F. Byrnes]], and General Arnold at the White House, August 1945]]
After World War II ended, the Congressional Joint Committee on the Investigation of the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor Attack]] received testimony on the intelligence failure. It amassed 25,000 pages of documents, 40 volumes, and included nine reports and investigations, eight of which had been previously completed. These reports included criticism of Marshall for delay in sending General [[Walter Short]], the Army commander in Hawaii, important information obtained from intercepted Japanese diplomatic messages. The report also criticized Marshall's lack of knowledge of the readiness of the Hawaiian Command during November and December 1941.{{sfn|U.S. Senate Joint Committee}} Ten days after the attack, Lt. General Short and Admiral [[Husband E. Kimmel]], commander of the Navy at Pearl Harbor, were both relieved of their duties. The final report of the Joint Committee did not single out or fault Marshall. While the report was critical of the overall situation, the committee noted that subordinates had failed to pass on important information to their superiors, including Marshall.<ref>Hearings before the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack, Congress of the United States, Seventy-Ninth Congress (Washington, D.C.), Part 39 |pp= 144–45.</ref><ref>Conclusions and Recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Investigation of the Pearl Harbor Attack, Congress of the United States, Seventy-Ninth Congress (Washington, D.C.) |pp= 252, 265</ref>

A secret report into the Army's role, the [[Clausen Report]] was authorized by Secretary [[Henry L. Stimson|Henry Stimson]]; it was critical of Short and also of Colonel [[Rufus S. Bratton|Bratton]] who, he concluded, arrived later on Sunday morning than he initially claimed during testimony and invented a story about not being able to get in touch with Marshall which "nearly destroyed" Marshall.{{sfn|Clausen|2001|pp=23–24}}

==Post war: China==
{{Main|Marshall Mission}}
[[File:Zhang, Marshall and Zhou.jpg|thumb|General Marshall with Chiang Kai-shek and [[Zhou Enlai]] in China, 1946.]]
In December 1945, President [[Foreign policy of the Harry S. Truman administration|Harry Truman]] [[Marshall Mission|dispatched Marshall]] to China, where he had served in the 1920s. His new mission was to prevent a resumption of the [[Chinese Civil War]] by brokering a coalition government between America's [[Kuomintang|Nationalist]] allies under Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]] and the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] of [[Mao Zedong]]. Marshall had no leverage over the Communists, but threatened to withdraw American aid essential to the Nationalists. Both sides rejected his proposals and he returned to the United States in January 1947.{{sfn|Stoler|1989|pp= 145–51}}{{sfn|Tsou|1963}} As Secretary of State, Marshall disagreed with the Defense and State Department views that Chiang's success was vital to American interests, insisting that U.S. troops not become involved. The war continued, and the Communists won in 1949.

==Secretary of State==
After Marshall's return to the U.S. in early 1947, Truman appointed him [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. As one of the most well-regarded and least politicized national leaders, he made an ideal front office personality. He became the spokesman for the State Department's ambitious plans to rebuild Europe. He did not design the plans, and paid little attention to details or negotiations. He did not keep current on details of foreign affairs. As one biographer notes, he had never been a workaholic. He turned over major responsibilities to his deputies, especially Under-Secretary [[Robert A. Lovett]], and refused to be troubled by minutiae. By 1948, with frailties building up, his participation was further curtailed. Marshall said, "The fact of the matter is that Lovett bears the principal burden as I get away whenever possible."{{sfn|Unger|Unger|Hirshson|2014 |pp= 389–90, 448}}
[[File:Photograph of George C. Marshall being sworn in as Secretary of State in the Oval Office by Chief Justice Fred... - NARA - 199520.jpg|left|thumb|General Marshall being sworn in as Secretary of State by Chief Justice [[Fred M. Vinson|Fred Vinson]] in the [[Oval Office]] on January 21, 1947.]]
On June 5, 1947 in a speech{{sfn|Marshall Plan}} at Harvard University, he outlined the American proposal. The European Recovery Program, as it was formally known, became known as the Marshall Plan. [[Clark Clifford]] had suggested to Truman that the plan be called the Truman Plan, but Truman immediately dismissed that idea and insisted that it be called the Marshall Plan.{{sfn|McCullough|1992a|p=717}}{{sfn|Behrman|2007|page=74}} The Marshall Plan would help Europe rebuild and modernize its economy along American lines, and open up new opportunities for international trade. Stalin ordered his satellites in Eastern Europe not to participate. Marshall was again named "Man of the Year" by ''Time'' in January 1948.<ref>See [http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19480105,00.html "George C.

[[File:Secretary of State General George C. Marshall Speak to The House Appropriations Committee.jpg|thumb|Secretary of State Marshall speaks to The [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations Committee]]. January 15, 1948.]]
Truman repeatedly rejected Marshall's advice on Middle Eastern policy.{{sfn|Brecher |2012|pp= 227-247.}} As Secretary of State, Marshall strongly opposed recognizing the newly formed state of [[Israel]]. Marshall felt that if the state of Israel was declared, a war would break out in the Middle East (which it did in 1948 one day after Israel declared independence). Marshall saw recognizing the Jewish state as a political move to gain Jewish support in the upcoming election, in which Truman was expected to lose to Dewey. He told President Truman in May 1948, "If you (recognize the state of Israel) and if I were to vote in the election, I would vote against you."{{sfn|JCPA: President Truman's Decision}}{{sfn|Truman Adviser Recalls May|1991|p=17}}{{sfn|Recognition of Israel}} However, Marshall refused to vote in any election as a matter of principle.{{sfn|Uldrich|2005}}{{sfn|McKinzie|1972}}{{efn-ua|Marshall even went to great lengths to prevent himself from falling prey to the allures of power.

In fact, on one occasion, I think it was over Palestine actually, he told the President -- I was told by somebody at the meeting -- "Mr. President, if you take this action I wouldn't vote for you, but of course I don't vote." He as an Army officer never voted apparently in his life" {{harv|McKinzie|1972}}.}}

During his tenure as Secretary of State, Marshall also urged Truman to immediately call for [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]] to stop their [[Indonesian National Revolution|invasion of Indonesia]], a former Dutch colony which had declared independence in 1945. The Netherlands ignored the Truman administration's initial entreaties. As a result, the Marshall Plan program for The Netherlands economic recovery was put on hold and the Truman administration threatened to cut all economic aid. The Netherlands finally agreed to withdraw and transferred sovereignty following the [[Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference]] in 1949.{{sfn|Gouda|2002}}

Marshall resigned as Secretary of State because of ill health on January 7, 1949. He was severely exhausted throughout his tenure in the position. [[Dean Acheson]] in late 1947 said he was underperforming like "a four-engine bomber going only on one engine."{{sfn|Stoler|1989|p= 173}} Truman named him to the largely honorific positions of chairman of the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]] and president of the American National Red Cross.{{sfn|Unger|Unger|Hirshson|2014 |p= 455}} He received the 1953 Nobel Peace Prize for his post-war work, despite the criticism that he was a warrior not a pacifist.<ref>See [https://www.marshallfoundation.org/blog/nobel-peace-prize/#:~:text=On%20December%2010%2C%201953%2C%20General,which%20had%20concluded%20in%201952 George C Marshall Foundation, "The Nobel Peace Prize" (2017)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926170230/https://www.marshallfoundation.org/blog/nobel-peace-prize/#:~:text=On%20December%2010%2C%201953%2C%20General,which%20had%20concluded%20in%201952 |date=2020-09-26 }}</ref>

==Secretary of Defense==
[[File:Secretary of Defense George C. Marshall at The Pentagon.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Secretary of Defense George C. Marshall in his office at The Pentagon.]]
When the early months of the [[Korean War]] showed how poorly prepared the Defense Department was, President Truman fired Secretary [[Louis A. Johnson]] and named Marshall as [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] in September 1950.{{sfn|Historical Office}} The appointment required a congressional waiver because the [[National Security Act of 1947]] prohibited a uniformed military officer from serving in the post. This prohibition included Marshall since individuals promoted to General of the Army are not technically retired, but remain officially on active duty even after their active service has concluded.{{sfn|Five-Star Generals in U.S.|2016}} Marshall was the first person to be granted such a waiver; in 2017, [[Jim Mattis]] became the second and in January 2021, General [[Lloyd Austin]] became the third.{{sfn|Marshall Mattis|2017}} Marshall's main role as Secretary of Defense was to restore confidence and morale to the Defense Department while rebuilding the armed forces following their post-World War II demobilization.
===Korean War===
[[File:L to R, President Truman, George Marshall, Paul Hoffman, and Averell Harriman, in the oval office discussing the... - NARA - 200036.tif|thumb|Secretary of Defense George C. Marshall discussing the Korean War with President Truman and Special Assistant to the President Averell Harriman in the Oval Office.]]
Marshall worked to provide more manpower to meet the demands of both the Korean War and the [[Cold War]] in Europe. To implement his priorities Marshall brought in a new leadership team, including [[Robert A. Lovett]] as his deputy and [[Anna M. Rosenberg]], former head of the [[War Manpower Commission]], as assistant secretary of defense for manpower. He also worked to rebuild the relationship between the Defense and State Departments, as well as the relationship between the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Marshall participated in the post-[[Battle of Inchon|Inchon landing]] discussion that led to authorizing [[Douglas MacArthur]] to conduct operations in North Korea. A secret "eyes only" signal from Marshall to MacArthur on September 29, 1950 declared the Truman administration's commitment: "We want you to feel unhampered strategically and tactically to proceed north of the [[38th parallel north|38th Parallel]]".{{sfn|A. Lewis|2012|p=104}} At the same time, Marshall advised against public pronouncements which might lead to [[United Nations]] votes undermining or countermanding the initial mandate to restore the border between North and South Korea. Marshall and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were generally supportive of MacArthur because they were of the view that field commanders should be able to exercise their best judgment in accomplishing the intent of their superiors.

Following Chinese military intervention in Korea during late November, Marshall and the Joint Chiefs of Staff sought ways to aid MacArthur while avoiding all-out war with China. In the debate over what to do about China's increased involvement, Marshall opposed a cease–fire on the grounds that it would make the U.S. look weak in China's eyes, leading to demands for future concessions.{{sfn|Foreign Relations of United}} In addition, Marshall argued that the U.S. had a moral obligation to honor its commitment to South Korea. When British Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] suggested diplomatic overtures to China, Marshall opposed, arguing that it was impossible to negotiate with the Communist government. In addition, Marshall expressed concern that concessions to China would undermine confidence in the U.S. among its Asian allies, including Japan and the Philippines. When some in Congress favored expanding the war in Korea and confronting China, Marshall argued against a wider war in Korea, continuing instead to stress the importance of containing the [[Soviet Union]] during the Cold War battle for primacy in Europe.
====Relief of General MacArthur====
{{main|Relief of Douglas MacArthur}}
[[File:Secretary of Defense General George C. Marshall with General Matthew B. Ridgway.jpg|left|thumb|Secretary of Defense George C. Marshall with General [[Matthew Ridgway|Matthew Ridgway]] at the [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|SCAP]] headquarters in [[Tokyo|Tokyo, Japan]], January 1951]]
Increasingly concerned about public statements from MacArthur, commander of United Nations forces fighting in the Korean War, which contradicted President Truman's on prosecution of the war, on the morning of 6 April 1951, Truman held a meeting with Marshall, [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] Omar Bradley, Secretary of State Dean Acheson and advisor [[W. Averell Harriman]] to discuss whether MacArthur should be removed from command.{{sfn|McCullough|1992b}}

Harriman was emphatically in favor of MacArthur's relief, but Bradley opposed it.{{sfn|McCullough|1992b}} Marshall asked for more time to consider the matter.{{sfn|McCullough|1992b}} Acheson was in favor but did not disclose this, instead warning Truman that if he did it, MacArthur's relief would cause "the biggest fight of your administration."{{sfn|Beisner|2009|p=429}} At another meeting the following day, Marshall and Bradley continued to oppose MacArthur's relief.{{sfn|McCullough|1992b}} On 8 April, the Joint Chiefs of Staff met with Marshall, and each expressed the view that MacArthur's relief was desirable from a "military point of view," suggesting that "if MacArthur were not relieved, a large segment of our people would charge that civil authorities no longer controlled the military."{{sfn|Cleaver|2019|pp=179}}

Marshall, Bradley, Acheson and Harriman met with Truman again on 9 April.{{sfn|McCullough|1992b}} Bradley informed the President of the views of the Joint Chiefs, and Marshall added that he agreed with them.{{sfn|McCullough|1992b}} Truman wrote in his diary that "it is of unanimous opinion of all that MacArthur be relieved. All four so advise."{{sfn|Diary entries 6 7}} (The Joint Chiefs would later insist that they had only "concurred" with the relief, not "recommended" it.){{sfn|Pearlman|2008|p=214}}

On April 11, 1951, President Truman directed transmittal of an order to MacArthur, issued over Bradley's signature, relieving MacArthur of his assignment in Korea and directing him to turn over command to [[Matthew Ridgway]].{{sfn|Willbanks|2013|p=99}} In line with Marshall's view, and those of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, MacArthur's relief was looked upon by proponents as being necessary to reassert the tenet of [[civilian control of the military]].{{sfn|McCullough|1992b}}

==Later life==
[[File:Dodona Manor.JPG|left|thumb|Dodona Manor, the 19th century home and gardens of George Marshall and his wife Katherine]]
===Retirement===
In September 1951, after 49 years of continuous public service, Marshall retired to his home, [[George C. Marshall's Dodona Manor|Dodona Manor]], in [[Leesburg, Virginia]].{{sfn|Wheeler|2015}} Purchased by the Marshalls in 1941, Dodona had previously served as a quiet weekend retreat for the busy couple.{{sfn|George C. Marshall's Dodona}} The home was restored beginning in the 1990s and the house and its gardens are open to the public as a museum.{{sfn|Wheeler|2015}}

It was at Dodona Manor that Marshall enjoyed his favorite food, roast leg of lamb, and his favorite beverage, an [[Old fashioned (cocktail)|old fashioned]].{{sfn|Stories of Service Richard}} Gardening was one of Marshall's favorite pastimes, and in retirement he grew vegetables throughout the year, including tomatoes and pumpkins, while Katherine Marshall enjoyed tending to her rose garden.{{sfn|George C. Marshall's Dodona}} In a 1942 letter to David Burpee, president of the [[Burpee Seeds and Plants|W. Atlee Burpee & Company]], Marshall wrote, "The business of seeds and flowers tantalizes me because I have been an amateur gardener, both flower and vegetable, since a boy of ten. There is nothing I would so much prefer to do this spring as to turn my mind to the wholesome business of gardening rather than the terrible problems and tragedies of war."{{sfn|3-147 To David Burpee}}

Katherine's love of roses was well known, leading inventor Eugene S. Boerner to create the Katherine Tupper Marshall Rose, a pink hybrid tea rose.{{sfn|Why is a rose}} It was patented by Jackson and Perkins in 1943.{{sfn|Why is a rose}}
===American Battle Monuments Commission===
Throughout his retirement, Marshall served as chairman of the American Battle Monuments Commission.{{sfn|Commission American Battle Monuments}} He oversaw the construction of fourteen cemeteries in eight countries following World War II to memorialize those killed or missing in battle.{{sfn|Building on Mission}} In the early 1950s, Marshall argued for the speedy construction and funding of cemeteries despite budget and staff cuts for the Korean War. Marshall wrote to General [[Joseph T. McNarney|Joseph McNarney]] in March 1951 saying, "I am naturally hesitant to become personally involved in individual personnel problems, but in this case, am deeply concerned about the overall moral factor if our foreign national cemeteries are not adequately maintained...."{{sfn|Building on Mission}} Marshall's efforts to secure building and maintenance staff for the cemeteries were successful, doubling the number of military officers assigned to the work.{{sfn|Building on Mission}} On September 13, 1952, Marshall attended the dedication ceremony of [[Suresnes American Cemetery and Memorial|Suresnes American Cemetery]] in France.{{sfn|Building on Mission}}{{sfn|Dedication of Cemetery}}
===Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II===
After retiring, Marshall largely withdrew from public life.{{sfn|Leadership of George C.}} A notable exception was in June 1953, when he accepted President Eisenhower's appointment to head the American delegation to [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|the coronation]] of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]].{{sfn|Queen Elizabeth II Coronation|2017}} The delegation included [[Earl Warren]] and Omar Bradley, and according to Bradley, as Marshall walked up the [[Westminster Abbey]] aisle to take his seat before the ceremony, the audience rose to its feet as a gesture of respect.{{sfn|Leadership of George C.}} Marshall looked behind him to see who the arriving dignitary was, then realized the audience had stood for him.{{sfn|Leadership of George C.}} Marshall was also invited to the post-ceremony banquet at [[Buckingham Palace]], and was the only non-royal seated at Queen Elizabeth's table.{{sfn|Leadership of George C.}}

George Marshall was the youngest of three siblings.{{sfn|Jeffers|Axelrod|2010|pp=6–8, 10, 12}} His older brother Stuart Bradford Marshall (1875–1956) was a graduate of the Virginia Military Institute, and became a manager and executive in several metal production corporations, including the American Manganese Manufacturing Company.{{sfn|Jeffers|Axelrod|2010|pages=6–8, 10, 12}}{{sfn|Parmelee|1918|p=214}}{{sfn|Glenn|2014|p=568}} He later worked as a metallurgist and consulting engineer specializing in the production and operation of blast furnaces, coke ovens, and foundries.{{sfn|Parmelee|1918|page=214}} George and Stuart Marshall were long estranged because George married Lily Coles, who a few years before had rejected Stuart's proposal.{{sfn|Jeffers|Axelrod|2010|pages=6–8, 10, 12}} When Stuart found out George was engaged to Lily, Stuart made unkind remarks about her, and George "cut him off my list."{{sfn|Jeffers|Axelrod|2010|pages=6–8, 10, 12}} Marshall's sister, Marie Louise (1876–1962) was the wife of Dr. John Johnson Singer, an Army physician who died in 1934.{{sfn|Greenburg Resident General Marshall's|1962|p=22}}

On February 11, 1902, Marshall married Elizabeth Carter "Lily" Coles at her mother's home in Lexington, Virginia.{{sfn|Stevens|Williams|2009|p=123}} Marshall met Lily after listening to her play the piano across the street from VMI.{{sfn|csonnier|2015a}} Marshall, being immediately smitten, would "run the block," or leave barracks after hours, to be with her.{{sfn|csonnier|2015a}} After traveling abroad to Japan, Korea, and China with Marshall, Lily returned to the U.S. to have a goiter removed. She died on September 15, 1927 after thyroid surgery that strained her weak heart.{{sfn|Mullins|2017|p=79}} They did not have children.{{sfn|Brooks|2015|p= 117}}

==Death and burial==
[[File:George Marshall Gravesite.jpg|thumb|upright|Grave site of George Marshall at Arlington National Cemetery]]
After a series of strokes, Marshall died at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center|Walter Reed Hospital]] in Washington, D.C. on October 16, 1959.{{sfn|Associated Press: Marshall Dies|1959|p=1}} Although he was entitled to official proceedings, Marshall preferred simplicity, so he received a special military funeral that dispensed with many of the usual activities.{{sfn|Mossman|Stark|1991|pp=159–167}} The ceremonies included lying in state at [[Washington National Cathedral]] for 24 hours, guarded by representatives from each U.S. armed service and a VMI cadet.{{sfn|Mossman|Stark|1991|pp=159–167}}

President Eisenhower ordered flags flown at half-staff, and was among the 200 guests invited for the funeral service held at [[Fort Myer]].{{sfn|Mossman|Stark|1991|pp=159–167}} Other dignitaries included former President Truman, Secretary of State [[Christian Herter|Christian A. Herter]], former Secretary of State Dean Acheson, former Governor W. Averell Harriman and Generals Omar N. Bradley, [[Alfred M. Gruenther]], and Matthew B. Ridgway.{{sfn|Mossman|Stark|1991|pp=159–167}} His parish priest, Franklin Moss Jr., from St. James Episcopal Church in Leesburg conducted the chapel and graveside services, assisted by former chief chaplain and National Cathedral Canon the Reverend [[Luther D.

The flag that draped Marshall's casket was folded and given to Mrs. Marshall by a VMI cadet.{{sfn|Mossman|Stark|1991|pp=159–167}}

Marshall was buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]], Section 7, Grave 8198, beside his first wife and her mother, Elizabeth Pendleton Coles (1849–1929).{{sfn|Associated Press: Marshall Dies|1959|p=1}}{{sfn|Mrs. Walter Coles|1929|p=6}} His second wife was also buried with him after she died on December 18, 1978.{{sfn|Mrs. Marshall|1978|p=12}} On its reverse side, the marble headstone lists General Marshall's positions held: "Chief of Staff U.S. Army, Secretary of State, President of American Red Cross, Secretary of Defense."

==Reputation and legacy==
[[File:Thomas Edgar Stephens - George C. Marshall - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|George Marshall portrait by [[Thomas E. Stephens]] (c. 1949)|left]]
As William Taylor and other historians have recently emphasized, George Marshall was the best-known and most active--and most selfless--American leader in the early Cold War. He is best known for giving his name and prestige to the Marshall Plan to rebuild the European economy. However, he suffered several defeats--he failed in the year-long effort to resolve the Chinese Civil War; he was defeated in his proposal to impose universal military service on all American men; and he was overruled by President Truman when he opposed the recognition of Israel. Historians agree that Truman depended heavily upon Marshall's prestige at a time of intensely bitter partisanship. Wilson Miscamble points to Marshall's delayed recognition of the threat posed by the Soviet Union – not until April 1947 did he realize the dangers. Miscamble concludes that recent studies show that Marshall was:<blockquote>An important contributor but hardly a dominant figure in the making of postwar American foreign policy. He had a special gift for delegation and he drew forth impressive contributions from various capable subordinates.{{sfn|Miscamble}}</blockquote>
Marshall's reputation for excellence as a military organizer and planner was recognized early in his career, and became known throughout the Army. In a performance appraisal prepared while Marshall was a lieutenant in the Philippines, his superior, Captain E. J. Williams responded to the routine question of whether he would want the evaluated officer to serve under his command again by writing of Marshall "Should the exigencies of active service place him in exalted command I would be glad to serve ''under him''." (Emphasis added.){{sfn|Editorial Note}}

In 1913, Lieutenant Colonel [[Johnson Hagood (general)|Johnson Hagood]] completed a written evaluation of Marshall's performance in which he called Marshall a military genius. Responding to the question of whether he would want his subordinate Marshall to serve under him again, Hagood wrote "Yes, but I would prefer to serve ''under his command''." (Emphasis added.){{sfn|Puryear|2000|p=191}} Hagood went on to recommend Marshall's immediate promotion to brigadier general, despite the fact that there were more than 1,800 officers, including Hagood, who were senior to him.{{sfn|Hambro|1953}}

After the surrender of the Nazi German government in May 1945, Henry L. Stimson, the [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], paid tribute to Marshall in front of a gathering of members of the Army staff, concluding with: "I have seen a great many soldiers in my lifetime and you, Sir, are the finest soldier I have ever known."{{sfn|Hambro|1953}}

Historians credit the high regard others had for Marshall's personal integrity as another reason for his positive legacy.{{sfn|Runkle|2019|pp=27–28}} In addition to his willingness to confront Pershing over Pershing's berating of the 1st Division chief of staff during World War I, Marshall cited other instances where he provided persistent advice that kept Pershing from creating needless controversy.{{sfn|Runkle|2019|pp=27–28}} In one, Marshall recalled a time when Pershing and Harbord intended to change a War Department policy implemented by [[Peyton March]], the chief of staff of the Army and Pershing's nominal superior, with whom Pershing had a long-running feud.{{sfn|Runkle|2019|pp=27–28}} Marshall counseled against it several times, and Pershing angrily indicated that his chief of staff [[James Harbord]] and he intended to submit their proposal despite Marshall's advice.{{sfn|Runkle|2019|pp=27–28}} Rather than concede, Marshall replied that Pershing was letting his personal feud with March cloud his judgment and that Harbord, who also disliked March, was doing the same.{{sfn|Runkle|2019|pp=27–28}} Instead of continuing to "pull rank," Pershing yielded to Marshall's judgment and said "Well, have it your own way."{{sfn|Runkle|2019|pp=27–28}}

In another incident that highlighted Marshall's reputation for integrity, when President Franklin Roosevelt, a former [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]], favored the Navy during World War II planning, Marshall suggested that Roosevelt stop referring to the Navy as "us" and the Army as "them."{{sfn|Christian Herald|1973|p=10}} Roosevelt laughed, but Marshall's humorous protest had made its point.{{sfn|Christian Herald|1973|p=10}}

In addition to his military success, Marshall is primarily remembered as the driving force behind the Marshall Plan, which provided billions of dollars in aid to post war Europe to restart the economies of the destroyed countries. In recent years, the cooperation required between former European adversaries as part of the Marshall Plan has been recognized as one of the earliest factors that led to formation of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], and eventually the [[European Union]].{{sfn|History of Marshall Plan}}

In a television interview after leaving office, Truman was asked which American he thought had made the greatest contribution of the preceding thirty years. Without hesitation, Truman picked Marshall, adding "I don't think in this age in which I have lived, that there has been a man who has been a greater administrator; a man with a knowledge of military affairs equal to General Marshall."{{sfn|Farinacci|2010|p=253}}

[[Orson Welles]] said in a 1970 interview with [[Dick Cavett]] that "Marshall is the greatest man I ever met... I think he was the greatest human being who was also a great man... He was a tremendous gentleman, an old fashioned institution which isn't with us anymore."{{sfn|Dick Cavett Show|1970}} The story Welles related to Cavett to illustrate his point was about a time he saw Marshall take the time to speak with a young, overawed American soldier who had accidentally entered the same room.{{sfn|Dick Cavett Show|1970}}
===Tributes and memorials===

Two non-profit organizations, the [[George C. Marshall Foundation]] and the George C. Marshall International Center, actively propagate General Marshall's legacy. The Marshall Foundation oversees Marshall's official papers and over two million other documents relating to the 20th century. The International Center preserves Marshall's home, Dodona Manor, as a museum and hosts educational programs focusing on Marshall's life, leadership, and role in American history.{{sfn|Home}}

Numerous streets are named for General Marshall, including George-Marshall-Straße in [[Wiesbaden, Germany]] and George-C.-Marshall-Ring in Oberursel, Germany.{{sfn|George-Marshall-Straße 65197 Wiesbaden Germany}}{{sfn|George-C.-Marshall-Ring 61440 Oberursel Germany}}

On April 30, 1998, the [[George C. Marshall European Center for Security Studies]] unveiled the first public statue of General Marshall in Europe in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen|Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany]].{{sfn|Marshall Center's Bronze Statue}} The slightly larger-than-life statue was sponsored by the Marshall Center, the Friends of the Marshall Center and the City of Garmisch-Partenkirchen. It shows Marshall in uniform walking across a bronze bridge, facing east, to greet new friends and allies and was designed by artist Christiane Horn of [[Wartenberg, Bavaria]]. [[Vernon A. Walters]], former [[Ambassadors of the United States|U.S. ambassador]] to Germany, was a keynote speaker during the dedication ceremony.{{sfn|Marshall Center's Bronze Statue}}
