'''Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf von Baeyer''' ({{IPA-de|ˈaːdɔlf fɔn ˈbaɪ̯ɐ|-|De-Adolf von Baeyer.ogg}}; 31 October 1835 – 20 August 1917) was a [[Germany|German]] [[chemist]] who synthesised [[indigo dye|indigo]]<ref>{{cite journal | title= Darstellung von Indigblau aus Orthonitrobenzaldehyd |trans-title=Preparation of blue indigo from o-nitrobenzaldehyde | author=Adolf Baeyer, Viggo Drewsen | journal=[[Berichte der deutschen chemischen Gesellschaft]] | volume=15 | issue=2 | pages=2856–2864 | year=1882 | url= http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k906950/f1258.image.langEN | doi=10.1002/cber.188201502274 }}</ref> and developed a [[Von Baeyer nomenclature|nomenclature for cyclic compounds]] (that was subsequently extended and adopted as part of the [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|IUPAC organic nomenclature]]). He was [[nobility|ennobled]] in the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] in 1885 and was the 1905 recipient of the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].<ref name="meijere">''Adolf von Baeyer: Winner of the Nobel Prize for Chemistry 1905 '' Armin de Meijere [[Angewandte Chemie International Edition]] Volume 44, Issue 48, Pages 7836 – 7840 '''2005''' [https://archive.today/20121210203036/http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/112190460/ABSTRACT Abstract]</ref>

==Family and education==
[[File:Baeyer.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Adolf von Baeyer's father, Prussian lieutenant-general [[Johann Jacob Baeyer]], the noted [[geodesist]]]]
Baeyer was born in [[Berlin]] as the son of the noted [[geodesist]] and lieutenant-general in the Royal Prussian Army [[Johann Jacob Baeyer]] and his wife Eugenie Baeyer née Hitzig (1807–1843).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1905/baeyer-bio.html |title=Adolf von Baeyer – Biographical |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=1917-08-20 |access-date=2013-12-09}}</ref> Both his parents were [[Lutherans]] at the time of his birth and he was raised in the Lutheran religion.<ref>[https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz7302.html Baeyer, Adolf Ritter von] in ''Deutsche Biographie''</ref> His mother was the daughter of [[Julius Eduard Hitzig]] and a member of the originally Jewish [[Itzig family]], and had converted to Christianity before marrying his father, who was of non-Jewish German descent. Baeyer had four sisters: Clara (born 1826) Emma (born 1831), Johanna (Jeanette) (born 1839), Adelaide (died 1843) and two brothers: Georg (born 1829) and Edward (born 1832). Baeyer lost his mother at a young age while she was giving birth to his sister Adelaide.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XewbBAAAQBAJ|title=Brücken aus Papier: Atlantischer Wissenstransfer in dem Briefnetzwerk des deutsch-amerikanischen Ehepaars Francis und Mathilde Lieber, 1827–1872|last=Schnurmann|first=Claudia|date=2014-10-15|publisher=LIT Verlag Münster|others=Note 1445|isbn=978-3-643-12678-8|location=Germany|pages=371|language=de}}</ref>

Although his birth name was Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf Baeyer, he was known simply as "Adolf Baeyer", throughout most of his life. The poet [[Adelbert von Chamisso]] and the astronomer [[Friedrich Bessel|Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel]] were his godparents. On his 50th birthday he was raised to the hereditary nobility by King [[Ludwig II of Bavaria]], conferring on him the "von" distinction.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPRB-OED1bcC|title=Encyclopedia of World Scientists|last=Oakes|first=Elizabeth H.|publisher=Infobase Publishing|year=2007|isbn=978-1-4381-1882-6|location=NY, USA|pages=39}}</ref>

Baeyer charted his own path into science early on, performing experiments on plant nutrition at his paternal grandfather's Müggelsheim farm as a boy; back in the confines of Berlin, he took to the test tubes with chemical experimentation starting at the age of nine. Three years later, he synthesized a previously unknown chemical compound -double carbonate of copper and sodium.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite book|title=Organic Chemistry since 1860|last=Hudson|first=John|date=1992-01-01|publisher=Springer US|isbn=978-1-4684-6443-6|pages=303|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4684-6441-2}}</ref> On his 13th birthday, he initiated his lifework, buying a chunk of indigo worth two [[Prussian Thaler|Thaler]]s for his first dye experiments.<ref name=":0" />

When still a schoolboy, his chemistry teacher at the [[Friedrich Wilhelm Gymnasium]] appointed him as his assistant. After graduating from secondary school in 1853, he entered the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin University]] to study [[physics]] and [[mathematics]]. A stint in the Prussian army interrupted his study until 1856, when he returned to academia at the [[Heidelberg University|University of Heidelberg]], intending to study [[chemistry]] under [[Robert Bunsen]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}  After an argument with the renowned chemist, however, he changed his mentor to [[August Kekulé]]. He continued to collaborate with Kekule even after he returned to Berlin in 1858 for the completion of his [[doctorate]] on arsenic methyl chloride, or [[Cacodylic acid|cacodylic chloride]].<ref name=":0" />

==Academic career and achievements==
After completing his doctorate, he followed Kekulé to the [[Ghent University|University of Ghent]], when Kekulé became professor there. He became a lecturer at the Berlin Gewerbeinstitut ({{Interlanguage link multi|Gewerbeinstitut Berlin|de|lt=Royal Trade Academy}}) in 1860 and a Professor at the [[University of Strasbourg]] in 1871. In 1875, he succeeded [[Justus von Liebig]] as Chemistry Professor at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Baeyer's chief achievements include the [[Chemical synthesis|synthesis]] and description of the plant [[dye]] [[indigo dye|indigo]], the discovery of the [[phthalein]] dyes, and the investigation of [[polyacetylene]]s, [[oxonium ion|oxonium]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s, [[nitroso]] compounds (1869) and [[uric acid]] derivatives (1860 and onwards) (including the discovery of [[barbituric acid]] (1864), the parent compound of the [[barbiturate]]s). He was the first to propose the correct formula for [[indole]] in 1869, after publishing the first synthesis three years earlier. His contributions to [[theoretical chemistry]] include the 'strain' (''Spannung'') theory of [[triple bond]]s and [[Baeyer strain theory|strain theory]] in small [[carbon]] rings.<ref>

In 1871 he discovered the synthesis of [[phenolphthalein]] by [[Condensation reaction|condensation]] of [[phthalic anhydride]] with two equivalents of [[phenol]] under [[acid]]ic conditions (hence the name). That same year he was the first to obtain synthetic [[fluorescein]], a [[fluorophore]] [[pigment]] which is similar to naturally occurring [[pyoverdin]] that is synthesised by microorganisms (e.g., by some [[Fluorescence|fluorescent]] strains of ''[[Pseudomonas]]''). Baeyer named his finding "resorcinphthalein" as he had synthesised it from [[phthalic anhydride]] and [[resorcinol]]. The term [[fluorescein]] would not start to be used until 1878.

In 1872 he experimented with [[phenol]] and [[formaldehyde]]; the resinous product<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/468698/major-industrial-polymers/76466/Phenol-formaldehyde | title=Major industrial polymers}}</ref> was a precursor for [[Leo Baekeland]]'s later commercialization of [[Bakelite]].

In 1881 the [[Royal Society of London]] awarded Baeyer the [[Davy Medal]] for his work with indigo. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1884.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=5 May 2011}}</ref> In 1905 he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] "in recognition of his services in the advancement of organic chemistry and the chemical industry, through his work on organic dyes and hydroaromatic compounds", and he continued in full active work as one of the best-known teachers in the world of organic chemistry up to within a year of his death.<ref>{{EB1922|inline=1|wstitle=Baeyer, Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf von|volume=30|page=365}}</ref>

Since 1911, is established the {{Interlanguage link multi|Adolf-von-Baeyer-Denkmünze|de|lt=Adolf von Baeyer Medal}} which is awarded annually.

His name is reflected in various "name reactions" as the [[Baeyer–Villiger oxidation]] and [[Baeyer's reagent]]. There is also the [[Von Baeyer nomenclature]] in structural chemistry and Baeyer [[Ring strain|strain theory]] (which granted him the Nobel prize) of [[alicyclic compound]]s.

He was elected member to several scientific academies, in 1884 to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbaw.de/die-akademie/akademiegeschichte/mitglieder-historisch/alphabetische-sortierung?altmitglied_id=94&letter=B|title=Mitglieder der Vorgängerakademien.|website=Adolf Ritter von Baeyer}}</ref> and 1885 a foreign member of the [[Royal Society of Chemistry|Royal Society]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/Dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqDb=Persons&dsqSearch=Code==%2527NA6255%2527&dsqCmd=Show.tcl|title=Baeyer, Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf von (1835–1917)|website=Archive of Royal Society|access-date=2016-07-17}}</ref>

In 2009 [[von Baeyer (crater)|von Baeyer]] [[Lunar craters|lunar crater]] was named after him.

== Personal life ==
In 1868, Baeyer married Adelheid (Lida) Bendemann, the daughter of a family friend, and together the couple had three children: Eugenie, Hans, and {{ill|Otto von Baeyer|de|lt=Otto}}.<ref name=":0" />
