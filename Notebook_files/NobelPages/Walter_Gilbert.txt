'''Walter Gilbert''' (born March 21, 1932) is an American [[Biochemistry|biochemist]], [[Physics|physicist]], [[molecular biology]] pioneer, and [[Nobel laureate]].<ref name=gilbertbio>{{Nobelprize|accessdate=2020-10-11}}</ref><ref name=Shampo/><ref>{{Scopus|id=16143132500}}</ref>

==Education and early life==
Walter Gilbert was born in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], on March 21, 1932, the son of Emma (Cohen), a child psychologist, and Richard V. Gilbert, an economist.<ref name=Shampo>{{cite journal |author=Shampo MA, Kyle RA |title=Walter Gilbert--1980 Nobel Prize for Chemistry |journal=Mayo Clin. Proc. |volume=78 |issue=5 |pages=588 |date=May 2003 |pmid=12744546 |doi= 10.4065/78.5.588|url=http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12744546|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.chilit.org/Published%20Papers/92.%20Schwartzberg%20--%20Advocate.PDF |title = Home - the Chicago Literary Club}}</ref>

When Gilbert was seven years old, the family moved to the [[Washington metropolitan area|Washington D.C. area]] so his father could work under [[Harry Hopkins]] on the New Deal [[Brain trust#Roosevelt's "Brain Trust"|brain trust]]. While living in Washington the family became friends with the family of [[I.F. Stone]] and Wally met Stone's oldest daughter, Celia, when they were both 8. They later married at age 21.<ref>{{cite news |last=Saltzman |first=Jonathan |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2018/03/30/five-things-you-should-know-about-wally-gilbert/HGGQQZzV8lgOeB1Ahbn5yI/story.html |title=Five things you should know about Wally Gilbert |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2018-03-31 |access-date=2018-04-01 }}</ref>

He was educated at the [[Sidwell Friends School]], and attended [[Harvard University]] for undergraduate and graduate studies, earning a [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] in [[chemistry]] and [[physics]] in 1953 and a [[master's degree]] in physics in 1954.<ref name=Shampo/> He studied for his doctorate at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he earned a [[Ph.D.]] in [[physics]] supervised by the Nobel laureate [[Abdus Salam]] in 1957.<ref name=Shampo/><ref name=phd>{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Cambridge|title=On generalised dispersion relations and meson-nucleon scattering|first= Walter|last=Gilbert|date=1958|url=http://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.599407|oclc=879396761}}</ref>

==Career and research==
Gilbert returned to Harvard in 1956 and was appointed assistant professor of physics in 1959.<ref name=Shampo/> Gilbert's wife Celia worked for [[James Watson]], leading Gilbert to become interested in molecular biology.  Watson and Gilbert ran their laboratory jointly through most of the 1960s, until Watson left for [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]].<ref name="Watson">{{ cite book | title = Genes, Girls and Gamow | last = Watson | first = James D. | year = 2003 }}</ref> In 1964 he was promoted to associate professor of biophysics and promoted again in 1968 to professor of biochemistry.<ref name=Shampo/>

He is a co-founder of the biotech start-up companies [[Biogen]], with Kenneth Murray, Phillip Sharp and Charles Weissman<ref>{{Cite web|last=Stendahl|first=Max|date=May 31, 2018|title=40 years later, Biogen’s founders Get the Band Back Together|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/news/2018/05/31/40-years-later-biogen-s-founders-get-the-band-back.html|url-status=live|website=Boston Business Journal}}</ref> and [[Myriad Genetics]] with Dr. Mark Skolnick and [[Kevin Kimberlin]]<ref>{{Cite book|last=Davies|first=Kevin|title=Breakthrough: The Race to Find the Breast Cancer Gene|last2=White|first2=Michael|publisher=Wiley|year=1996|pages=199}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=April 25, 2018|title=MYRIAD: PIONEERING PREDICTIVE MEDICINE|url=https://pivotcenter.utah.edu/success-stories/myriad-pioneering-predictive-medicine/|url-status=live|website=University of Utah}}</ref> where he was the first chairman on their respective boards of directors. Gilbert left his position at Harvard to run Biogen as CEO, but was later asked to resign by the company's board of directors.<ref name="Kanigel">{{ cite journal | title = The Genome Project | journal = The New York Times Magazine | date = December 13, 1987 | last = Kanigel | first = Robert| pages = 44, 98–101, 106 | pmid = 11658922 }}</ref> He is a member of the Board of Scientific Governors at [[The Scripps Research Institute]]. Gilbert has served as the chairman of the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]].

In 1996, Gilbert and [[Stuart B. Levy]] founded Paratek Pharmaceuticals. Gilbert served as chairman until 2014.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://paratekpharma.com/about/founders/#dr-gilbert |title = Founders}}</ref>

Gilbert was an early proponent of sequencing the [[human genome]]. At a March 1986 meeting in [[Santa Fe New Mexico]] he proclaimed "The total human sequence is the grail of human genetics". In 1987, he proposed starting a company called Genome Corporation to sequence the genome and sell access to the information.<ref name="Kanigel"/>  In an opinion piece in Nature in 1991, he envisioned completion of the human genome sequence transforming biology into a field in which computer databases would be as essential as laboratory reagents<ref>{{cite journal | title = Towards a paradigm shift in biology | last=Gilbert | first=Walter | journal=Nature | year=1991 |volume=349 | number=6305 | page=99 |bibcode = 1991Natur.349...99G |doi = 10.1038/349099a0 | pmid=1986314 | s2cid=1173431 | doi-access=free }}</ref>

In 1962, Gilbert's Ph.D. student in physics [[Gerald Guralnik]] extended Gilbert's work on massless particles; Guralnik's work on is widely recognized as an important thread in the discovery of the [[Higgs Boson]].<ref>{{ cite book | title = The Infinity Puzzle: The Personalities, Politics and Extraordinary Science Behind the Higgs Boson | author = Close, Frank  | pages = 146–147 | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2013}}</ref>

With his Ph.D. student [[Benno Müller-Hill]], Gilbert was the first to purify the [[lac repressor]],<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 16591435 | title = Isolation of the lac repressor | last1=Gilbert | first1 = Walter | last2 = Müller-Hill | first2 = Benno | date = December 1966 | volume = 56 | issue = 6 | pages = 1891–1898|journal=PNAS | doi=10.1073/pnas.56.6.1891 | pmc=220206|bibcode = 1966PNAS...56.1891G | doi-access = free }}</ref> just beating out [[Mark Ptashne]] for purifying the first gene regulatory protein.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 16591470 | journal=PNAS|title = Isolation of the lambda phage repressor | last=Ptashne | first = Mark  | date = February 1967 | volume = 57 | issue = 2 | pages = 306–313 | doi=10.1073/pnas.57.2.306 | pmc=335506|bibcode = 1967PNAS...57..306P | doi-access=free}}</ref>

Together with [[Allan Maxam]], Gilbert developed a new [[DNA sequencing]] method,  [[Maxam–Gilbert sequencing]],<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Allan | first1=Maxam | last2=Walter | first2=Gilbert | title=Sequencing end-labeled DNA with base-specific chemical cleavages | journal=[[Methods in Enzymology]] | year=1980 |pmid=6246368|volume=65|issue=1|pages=499–560 | doi=10.1016/S0076-6879(80)65059-9}}</ref><ref name="Maxam"/> using chemical methods developed by Andrei Mirzabekov. His approach to the first synthesis of [[insulin]] via [[recombinant DNA]] lost out to [[Genentech]]'s approach which used genes built up from the nucleotides rather than from natural sources. Gilbert's effort was hampered by a temporary moratorium on recombinant DNA work in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], forcing his group to move their work to an English biological weapons site.<ref>{{ cite book | title = Invisible Frontiers: The Race to Synthesize a Human Gene | last = Hall | first = Stephen S. | year = 1987 | publisher = Atlantic Monthly Press }}</ref>

Gilbert first proposed the existence of [[introns]] and [[exons]] and explained the evolution of introns in a seminal 1978 "News and Views" paper published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.<ref>{{ cite journal | last=Gilbert | first = Walter | title = Why genes in pieces | date =February 9, 1978 | volume = 271 | issue=5645 | page=501 | journal = Nature|bibcode = 1978Natur.271..501G |doi = 10.1038/271501a0 | pmid=622185| s2cid = 4216649 | doi-access = free }}</ref>  In 1986, Gilbert proposed the [[RNA world hypothesis]] for the [[origin of life]],<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Gilbert | first1 = W. | title = Origin of life: The RNA world | doi = 10.1038/319618a0 | journal = Nature | volume = 319 | issue = 6055 | pages = 618 | year = 1986 | bibcode=1986Natur.319..618G| s2cid = 8026658 | doi-access = free }}</ref> based on a concept first proposed by [[Carl Woese]] in 1967.
