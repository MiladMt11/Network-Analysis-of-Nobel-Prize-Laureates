'''John Bannister Goodenough''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ʊ|d|ɪ|n|ʌ|f}} {{respell|GUUD|in|uf}};<ref>{{YouTube|kR8CESrigEg|Expert Opinion with Dr. Goodenough - The Future of Battery Storage (Expert Audience)}}</ref> born July 25, 1922)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://history.aip.org/phn/11512001.html |title=John B. Goodenough |work=[[American Institute of Physics]]}}</ref> is an American materials scientist, a [[solid-state physicist]], and a [[Nobel Laureate in Chemistry|Nobel laureate in chemistry]].  He is a professor of [[electrical and computer engineering]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. He is widely credited with the identification and development of the [[lithium-ion battery]], for developing the [[Superexchange|Goodenough–Kanamori rules]] in determining the sign of the magnetic [[superexchange]] in materials, and for seminal developments in computer [[random-access memory]].

Goodenough was born in [[Jena]], Germany, to American parents. During and after graduating from [[Yale University]], Goodenough served as a U.S. military [[Meteorology|meteorologist]] in World War II. He went on to obtain his Ph.D. in physics at the [[University of Chicago]], became a researcher at [[MIT Lincoln Laboratory]], and later the head of the [[Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory]] at the [[University of Oxford]]. Since 1986, he has been a professor in the school of engineering at UT Austin. 
      
He has been awarded the [[National Medal of Science]], the [[Copley Medal]], the [[Enrico Fermi Award|Fermi Award]], the [[Charles Stark Draper Prize|Draper Prize]], and the [[Japan Prize]]. The [[John B Goodenough Award]] in materials science is named for him. In 2019, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] alongside [[M. Stanley Whittingham]] and [[Akira Yoshino]], and, at 97 years old, became the oldest Nobel laureate in history.<ref name="NYT-20191009" /> He became the oldest living Nobel Prize laureate on August 27, 2021, upon the death of [[Edmond H. Fischer]].

==Early life and education==
John Goodenough was born in Jena, Germany, to American parents, [[Erwin Ramsdell Goodenough]] (1893–1965) and Helen Miriam (Lewis) Goodenough.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TOYkAAAAYAAJ&q=%22Helen+Miriam+Lewis%22 |title=Myth for Moderns: Erwin Ramsdell Goodenough and Religious Studies in America, 1938-1955 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |year=1997 |first=Eleanor Bustin |last=Mattes |isbn=978-0-8108-3339-5 |via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref> His father was working on his Ph.D. at the [[Harvard Divinity School]] at the time of John's birth and later became a professor in the history of religion at [[Yale University]]. John's brother, the late [[Ward Goodenough]], was a [[University of Pennsylvania]] anthropologist. The brothers attended boarding school at [[Groton School|Groton]] in [[Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=LeVine |first1=Steve |title=The man who brought us the lithium-ion battery at the age of 57 has an idea for a new one at 92 |url=http://qz.com/338767/the-man-who-brought-us-the-lithium-ion-battery-at-57-has-an-idea-for-a-new-one-at-92/ |access-date=February 5, 2015 |work=[[Quartz (publication)]] |publisher=[[Atlantic Media Company]] |date=February 5, 2015}}</ref> In 1944, John Goodenough received a [[B.S.]] in [[Mathematics]], [[summa cum laude]] from [[Yale University]], where he was a member of [[Skull and Bones]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ufMTLWx30q0C |title=Witness to Grace |publisher=[[PublishAmerica]] |last=Goodenough |first=John B. |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-4626-0757-0 |via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref>

==Career and research==

===MIT Lincoln Laboratory===
After his studies, Goodenough was a research scientist and team leader at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT's]] [[Lincoln Laboratory]] for 24 years. During this time he was part of an interdisciplinary team responsible for developing [[Random Access Memory|random access magnetic memory]]. His research efforts on RAM led him to develop the concepts of cooperative orbital ordering, also known as a cooperative [[Jahn–Teller distortion]], in oxide materials, and subsequently led to his developing the rules for the sign of the magnetic superexchange in materials, now known as the Goodenough–Kanamori rules (with [[:ja:金森順次郎|Junjiro Kanamori]]).<ref name=RSC1/>.

===Tenure at the University of Oxford===
[[File:Inorganic-chemistry-lab-Oxford-plaque.jpg|thumb|[[Blue plaque]] erected by the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] commemorating work towards the rechargeable lithium-ion battery at Oxford]]
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, he continued his career as head of the [[Inorganic Chemistry Laboratory]] at [[University of Oxford]]. Among his work at Oxford, Goodenough has been credited with significant research essential to the development of commercial [[Li-ion battery|lithium-ion rechargeable batteries]].<ref name=RSC1/> Goodenough was able to expand upon previous work from [[M. Stanley Whittingham]] on battery materials, and found in 1980 that by using Li<sub>x</sub>CoO<sub>2</sub> as a lightweight, high energy density [[cathode]] material, he could double the capacity of lithium-ion batteries. Goodenough's work was commercialized through [[Sony]] by [[Akira Yoshino]], who had contributed additional improvements to the battery construction.<ref name="CNN Nobel">{{cite web | url = https://www.cnn.com/2019/10/09/us/john-goodenough-nobel-prize-trnd/index.html | title = John B.

==Fundamental investigations==
On the fundamental side, his research has focused on [[magnetism]] and on the [[Metal–insulator transition]] behavior in [[transition-metal oxides]]. Along with Junjiro Kanamori, Goodenough developed a set of semi-empirical rules to predict magnetism in these materials in the 1950s and 1960s, now called the Goodenough–Kanamori rules, forming the basis of [[superexchange]], which is a core property for [[high-temperature superconductivity]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=J.
