'''Allvar Gullstrand''' (5 June 1862 – 28 July 1930) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[ophthalmologist]] and [[optician]].

== Life ==
Born at [[Landskrona]], [[Sweden]], Gullstrand was professor (1894–1927) successively of [[ophthalmology|eye therapy]] and of [[optics]] at the [[University of Uppsala]]. He applied the methods of physical mathematics to the study of optical images and of the refraction of light in the eye. For this work, he received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1911.

Gullstrand is noted also for his research on [[Astigmatism (eye)|astigmatism]]<ref>Gullstrand, Allvar (1890) ''Skand. Arch. f. Physiol.''; and (1901) ''Arch. f.  Ophth.'', 53, pp. 2, 185.</ref> and for improving the [[ophthalmoscope]] and corrective lenses for use after removal of a [[cataract]] from the eye.

He was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1905, and served on the Academy's Prize Committee for Physics. While serving on the committee, he used his position to block [[Albert Einstein]] from receiving a [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his [[theory of relativity]], which Allvar believed to be wrong.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Gullstrand, Einstein, and the Nobel Prize |first=James G. |last=Ravin |journal=Arch Ophthalmol |year=1999 |volume=117 |issue=5 |pages=670–672 |doi=10.1001/archopht.117.5.670|pmid=10326967 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

Gullstrand married Signe Breitholtz (1862–1946) in 1885.

Due to the mathematical content of Gullstand's writing, [[Horatio Burt Williams]] lamented in 1926 that "there are few ophthalmologists and not many physiologists who are able to read [Gullstrand's papers] and for the same reason that the chemists of Gibbs' day were unable to read his work."<ref>[[Horatio Burt Williams]] (1927) [https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bams/1183492099 Mathematics and the Biological Sciences], [[Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society]] 33(3): 273–94 via [[Project Euclid]], quote from page 278</ref>

Gullstrand died in Stockholm in 1930, where he was interred at [[Norra begravningsplatsen]].
