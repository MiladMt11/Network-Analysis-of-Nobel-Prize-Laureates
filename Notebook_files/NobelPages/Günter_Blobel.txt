'''Günter Blobel''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡʏntɐ ˈbloːbl̩|-|De-Günter Blobel.ogg}}; May 21, 1936 – February 18, 2018) was a [[Silesia]]n [[Germans|German]] and American [[biologist]] and 1999 [[Nobel Prize]] laureate in Physiology for the discovery that proteins have intrinsic signals that govern their transport and localization in the cell.

==Biography==
Günter Blobel was born in [[Niegosławice, Lubusz Voivodeship|Waltersdorf]] in the [[Prussia]]n [[Province of Lower Silesia]], then located in eastern Germany. In January 1945 his family fled from native Silesia to [[Dresden]] to escape from the advancing [[Red Army]]. During the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|bombing of Dresden]], Blobel, then 8, stayed with his family at a relative's farm to the west of the city. After the war, Blobel grew up and attended [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in the [[Saxony|Saxon]] town of [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]]. He studied medicine and graduated from the [[University of Tübingen]] in 1960. After two years service in a medical internship, he moved to Madison, Wisconsin, following an older brother, enrolling in the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] and, joining the lab of [[Van Rensselaer Potter|Van R. Potter]] for his graduate work. Blobel matriculated in 1967 with a Ph.D., then took up a professorship in microbiology at the University.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Simon|first=Sanford M.|date=5 April 2018|title=Günter Blobel (1936–2018)|url= |journal=Cell|volume=173|issue=2|pages=278–280|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2018.03.047|pmid=29975496|pmc=6018020}}</ref><!-- citation covers the paragraph, to avoid citation proliferation -->

Blobel was appointed to the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] in 1986. Blobel was awarded the 1999 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for the discovery of [[signal peptides]].<ref>{{Cite press release|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1999|date=11 October 1999|publisher=The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1999/press.html|quote=The Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet has today decided to award the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for 1999 to Günter Blobel for the discovery that "proteins have intrinsic signals that govern their transport and localization in the cell"}}</ref> Signal peptides form an integral part of [[protein targeting]], a mechanism for cells to direct newly synthesized [[protein]] molecules to their proper location by means of an "address tag" (i.e., a signal peptide) within the molecule.

Blobel died of cancer in [[Manhattan]] at New York-Presbyterian Weill Cornell Medical Center on February 18, 2018 at the age of 81.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/regionales/sachsen/article173727922/Nobelpreistraeger-Guenter-Blobel-gestorben.html|title=Nobelpreisträger Günter Blobel gestorben|last=<!--no byline-->|date=19 February 2018|work=Die Welt|access-date=2018-04-14|language=de|trans-title=Nobel Prize winner Günter Blobel died<!--Google Translate-->}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/obituaries/gunter-blobel-nobel-laureate-who-found-cell-zip-codes-dies-at-81.html|title=Günter Blobel, Nobel Laureate Who Found Cell 'ZIP Codes,' Dies at 81|last=McFadden|first=Robert D|date=19 February 2018|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-04-14|department=Obituaries|url-access=limited}}</ref> By the time of his death, Blobel was described as having "ushered cell biology into the molecular age" through his work on the fractionation and reconstitution of functional protein complexes and sub-cellular components ''in vitro''.<ref name=":0" />

==Philanthropy==
Blobel became well known for his direct and active support for the rebuilding of [[Dresden]] in [[Germany]], becoming, in 1994, the founder and president of the nonprofit "Friends of Dresden, Inc." He donated all of the Nobel award money to the restoration of Dresden, in particular for the rebuilding of the [[Dresden Frauenkirche|Frauenkirche]] (completed in 2005) and the building of a new [[synagogue]]. In Leipzig he pursued a rebuilding of the [[Paulinerkirche, Leipzig|Paulinerkirche]], the university church of the [[University of Leipzig]], which had been blown up by the communist regime of East Germany in 1968, arguing "this is a shrine of German cultural history, connected to the most important names in German cultural history."<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1300201 Perils of Paulinerkirche / Leipzig Debates Bid to Rebuild Church Razed by Communists] [[National Public Radio]] 22 June 2003</ref> Gunter was also a founding member of the board of directors of Research Foundation to Cure AIDS, a U.S. not-for-profit research organization.

==Personal life==
Blobel lost his older sister to aerial bombing of a train she was on in 1945, shortly after the bombing of Dresden, while an older brother survived the war and became a veterinarian in the United States.<ref name=":0" /> Blobel worked at the [[Rockefeller University]] in [[New York City]] from 1968. He lived in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Upper East Side]] with his wife, Laura Maioglio (owner of [[Barbetta]]).<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{cite web|title=History of Barbetta|url=http://barbettarestaurant.com/history.html|website=Barbetta Restaurant|access-date=28 March 2015}}</ref> He was on the board of directors for [[Nestlé]] and the Board of Scientific Governors at [[The Scripps Research Institute]]. Furthermore, he was Co-Founder and Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board for Chromocell Corporation.<ref>[http://www.chromocell.com/scientific_advisors.html Gunter Blobel, M.D., Ph.D. / Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327081719/http://www.chromocell.com/scientific_advisors.html |date=2009-03-27 }}</ref> He sat on the Selection Committee for Life Science and Medicine which chooses winners of the [[Shaw Prize]]. Blobel had a passion for opera and architecture, in addition to his passion for experimental science.<ref name=":0" />
