'''Charles Gates Dawes''' (August 27, 1865 – April 23, 1951) was an American banker, general, diplomat, composer, and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politician who was the 30th [[vice president of the United States]] from 1925 to 1929. For his work on the [[Dawes Plan]] for [[World War I reparations]], he was a co-recipient of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1925.

Born in [[Marietta, Ohio]], Dawes attended [[Cincinnati Law School]] before beginning a legal career in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]]. After serving as a gas plant executive, he managed [[William McKinley]]'s 1896 presidential campaign in Illinois. After the election, McKinley appointed Dawes as the [[Office of the Comptroller of the Currency|Comptroller of the Currency]]. He remained in that position until 1901 before forming the Central Trust Company of Illinois. Dawes served as a general during [[World War I]] and was the chairman of the general purchasing board for the [[American Expeditionary Forces]]. In 1921, President [[Warren G. Harding]] appointed Dawes as the first Director of the [[Office of Management and Budget|Bureau of the Budget]]. Dawes served on the Allied Reparations Commission, where he helped formulate the Dawes Plan to aid the struggling [[Germany|German]] economy, though the plan was eventually replaced by the [[Young Plan]].

The [[1924 Republican National Convention]] nominated President [[Calvin Coolidge]] without opposition. After former Governor of Illinois [[Frank Lowden]] declined the vice-presidential nomination, the convention chose Dawes as Coolidge's running mate. The Republican ticket won the [[1924 United States presidential election|1924 presidential election]], and Dawes was sworn in as vice president in 1925. Dawes helped pass the [[McNary–Haugen Farm Relief Bill]] in Congress, but President Coolidge vetoed it. Dawes was a candidate for renomination at the [[1928 Republican National Convention]], but Coolidge's opposition to Dawes helped ensure that [[Charles Curtis]] was nominated instead. In 1929, President [[Herbert Hoover]] appointed Dawes to be the [[U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom|Ambassador to the United Kingdom]]. Dawes also briefly led the [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]], which organized a government response to the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. He resigned from that position in 1932 to return to banking, and he died in 1951 of [[coronary thrombosis]].

==Early life and family==

Dawes was born in [[Marietta, Ohio]], in [[Washington County, OH|Washington County]], son of [[American Civil War|Civil War]] General [[Rufus Dawes]] and his wife Mary Beman Gates.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dunlap|first=Annette B.|title=Charles Gates Dawes: a Life|publisher=Northwestern University Press and the Evanston History Center |date=2016|isbn = 9780810134195|page=12}}</ref> Rufus had commanded the 6th Wisconsin Regiment of the [[Iron Brigade]] from 1863 to 1864 during the [[American Civil War]].

Dawes's brothers were [[Rufus C. Dawes]], [[Beman Gates Dawes]], and [[Henry May Dawes]], all prominent businessmen or politicians. He had two sisters, Mary Frances Dawes Beach, and Betsey Gates Dawes Hoyt.<ref>Gates Dawes Ancestral Lines</ref>

Dawes was a descendant of [[Edward Doty]], a passenger on the ''[[Mayflower]],'' and [[William Dawes]] who rode with [[Paul Revere]] to warn American colonists of the advancing British army at the outbreak of the [[American Revolution]].

Dawes married [[Caro Blymyer]] on January 24, 1889.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pd/Charles_Dawes.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215120733/http://www.adherents.com/people/pd/Charles_Dawes.html|url-status=usurped|archive-date=February 15, 2006|title=The religion of Charles G.

==Early political career==
Dawes's prominent positions in business caught the attention of Republican party leaders. They asked Dawes to manage the Illinois portion of [[William McKinley]]'s bid for the [[President of the United States|Presidency of the United States]] in [[1896 United States presidential election|1896]].<ref>Davis, Jr., Henry Blaine (1998). ''Generals in Khaki.'' Pentland Press, Inc. p. 81. {{ISBN|1571970886}}. {{OCLC|40298151}}</ref> Following McKinley's election, Dawes was named [[Comptroller of the Currency]], [[United States Department of the Treasury]]. Serving in that position from 1898 to 1901, he collected more than $25 million from banks that had failed during the [[Panic of 1893]] and changed banking practices to try to prevent another panic.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In October 1901, Dawes left the Department of the Treasury to pursue a U.S. Senate seat from Illinois. He thought that, with the help of the McKinley Administration, he could win it. McKinley was assassinated and his successor, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], preferred Dawes's opponent.<ref>(Waller 1998: 274)</ref> In 1902, following this unsuccessful attempt at legislative office, Dawes declared that he was done with politics. He organized the Central Trust Company of Illinois, where he served as its president until 1921.<ref name="Davis"/>

On September 5, 1912, Dawes's 21-year-old son Rufus drowned in [[Geneva Lake]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://evanstonhistorycenter.org/charles-gates-dawes-timeline/|title=Charles Gates Dawes Timeline – Evanston History Center}}</ref> while on summer break from [[Princeton University]].

==World War I==
[[File:BGen Charles G Dawes.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Gen. Charles Dawes during World War I]]

Dawes helped support the first [[Anglo-French Financial Commission|Anglo-French Loan]] to the [[Entente Cordiale|Entente powers]] of $500 million. Dawes's support was important because the [[House of Morgan]] needed public support from a non-Morgan banker. The Morgan banker [[Thomas W. Lamont]] said that Dawes's support would "make a position for him in the banking world such as he otherwise could never hope to make."<ref>[https://mises.org/journals/jls/19_1/19_1_4.pdf ''Merchants of Death Revisited''] [[Mises Institute]] p. 61</ref> (Loans were seen as possibly violating neutrality, and Wilson was still resisting permitting loans.)

During WWI, Dawes was commissioned as a major on June 11, 1917, in the 17th Engineers.  He was subsequently promoted to lieutenant colonel (July 17, 1917), and colonel (January 16, 1918).  In October 1918, he was promoted to brigadier general.<ref>''New York Times''.  October 4, 1918.</ref>  From August 1917 to August 1919, Dawes served in France during WWI as chairman of the general purchasing board for the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF). His proposal to Gen. Pershing was adopted informed the [[Military Board of Allied Supply]], on which he served as the American delegate in 1918. When the war ended in November, he became a member of the  Liquidation Commission of the [[United States War Department]].  He was decorated with the [[Distinguished Service Medal (U.S. Army)|Distinguished Service Medal]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://valor.militarytimes.com/recipient.php?recipientid=17453|title=Valor awards for Charles G. Dawes}}</ref> and the French [[Croix de Guerre]] in recognition of his service.  He returned to the US aboard the [[SS Leviathan|SS ''Leviathan'']] in August 1919.<ref>''New York Times''.  August 7, 1919.</ref>

In February 1921, the U.S. Senate held hearings on war expenditures. During heated testimony, Dawes burst out, "Hell and Maria, we weren't trying to keep a set of books over there, we were trying to win a war!"<ref>{{cite book|last=Dunlap|first=Annette B.|title=Charles Dawes Gates: a Life|page=144}}</ref> He was later known as "Hell and Maria Dawes" (although he always insisted the expression was "Helen Maria", an exclamation he claimed was common in Nebraska).<ref>{{cite web |title=Vice President Dawes |url=https://forbeslibrary.org/blog/2014/06/16/vice-president-dawes/ |website=Forbes Library |access-date=12 July 2018}}</ref> Dawes resigned from the Army in 1919<ref name="Davis"/> and became a member of the [[American Legion]].

==1920s: Financing Europe and the Nobel Peace Prize==
He supported [[Frank Lowden]] at the [[1920 Republican National Convention]], but the presidential nomination went to [[Warren G. Harding]].<ref name="dawesvp1"/> When the [[United States Office of Management and Budget|Bureau of the Budget]] was created, he was appointed in 1921 by President Harding as its first director. Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover appointed him to the Allied Reparations Commission in 1923.  He devidsed the solution to the European crisis: The [[Dawes Plan]] loaned large sums of American bank money to the German economy. The loans permitted Germany to recover its industrial production while making reparation payments to France and Belgium as required by the Versailles Treaty. In 1929 the Reparations Commission, under [[Owen Young]], replaced the plan with the more permanent [[Young Plan]], which reduced the total amount of reparations and called for the removal of occupying forces.<ref>Dunlap, pp. 214–15.</ref><ref>Stephen A. Schuker, ''The end of French predominance in Europe: the financial crisis of 1924 and the adoption of the Dawes Plan'' (U of North Carolina Press, 1976).</ref>  For his work on the [[Dawes Plan]] that enabled Germany to restore and stabilize its economy, Dawes shared the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1925.<ref name="Davis"/>

==Vice presidency (1925–1929)==
[[File:Coolidge-Dawes.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1|Dawes (r) and [[Calvin Coolidge]]]]

{{quote|I should hate to think that the Senate was as tired of me at the beginning of my service as I am of the Senate at the end.|Charles G. Dawes<ref name="Hatfield">Hatfield, M. O. (1997). Vice Presidents of the United States, 1789–1993. Senate Historical Office. Washington: United States Government Printing Office</ref>}}

At the [[1924 Republican National Convention]], President [[Calvin Coolidge]] was selected almost without opposition to be the Republican presidential nominee.<ref name="Hatfield1997" >Hatfield 1997: 363</ref> The vice-presidential nominee was more contested. Illinois Governor [[Frank Lowden]] was nominated, but declined. Coolidge's next choice was Idaho Senator [[William Borah]], who also declined the nomination. The Republican National Chairman, William Butler, wanted to nominate then-Commerce Secretary [[Herbert Hoover]], but he was insufficiently popular.  Eventually, the delegates chose Dawes. Coolidge quickly accepted the delegates' choice and felt that Dawes would be loyal to him and make a strong addition to his campaign.<ref name="Hatfield1997"/>

Dawes traveled throughout the country during the campaign, giving speeches to bolster the Republican ticket. He frequently attacked [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)|Progressive]] nominee [[Robert M. La Follette]] as a dangerous radical who sympathized with the Bolsheviks.<ref name="dawesvp1"/> The Coolidge-Dawes ticket was elected on November 4, 1924, with more popular votes than the candidates of the Democratic and Progressive parties combined.<ref>Hatfield 1997: 364</ref> The inauguration was held on March 4, 1925.<ref name="AFR">{{cite book|title=American Foreign Relations, A History|page=193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rgnm9C5u1DMC&pg=PT193|access-date=26 January 2017|isbn=9781619066649|last1=Reviews|first1=C.T.I|date=2016-10-16}}</ref>

On March 10, the Senate debated the president's nomination of [[Charles B. Warren]] to be [[United States Attorney General]]. In the wake of the [[Teapot Dome scandal]] and other scandals, Democrats and Progressive Republicans objected to the nomination because of Warren's close association with the [[American Sugar Refining Company|Sugar Trust]]. At midday, six speakers were scheduled to address Warren's nomination. Desiring to take a break for a nap, Dawes consulted the majority and minority leaders, who assured him that no vote would be taken that afternoon. After Dawes left the Senate, all but one of the scheduled speakers decided against making formal remarks, and a vote was taken. When it became apparent that the vote would be tied, Republican leaders hastily called Dawes at the Willard Hotel, and he immediately left for the Capitol. The first vote was 40-40, a tie which Dawes could have broken in Warren's favor.  While waiting for Dawes to arrive, the only Democratic senator who had voted for Warren switched his vote. The nomination then failed 41-39—the first such rejection of a president's nominee in nearly 60 years.<ref name="Hatfield"/> This incident was chronicled in a derisive poem, based on the Longfellow poem "[[Paul Revere's Ride (poem)|Paul Revere's Ride]];" it began with the line, "Come gather round children and hold your applause for the afternoon ride of Charlie Dawes." The choice of poem was based on Charles Dawes being descended from [[William Dawes]], who rode with Paul Revere.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Dawes and Coolidge became alienated from one another. Dawes declined to attend Cabinet meetings and annoyed Coolidge with his attack on the Senate [[filibuster in the United States Senate|filibuster]]. Dawes championed the [[McNary–Haugen Farm Relief Bill]], which sought to alleviate the 1920s [[farm crisis]] by having the government buy surplus farm produce and sell that surplus in foreign markets. Dawes helped ensure the passage of the bill through Congress, but President Coolidge vetoed it.<ref name="dawesvp1"/>

In 1927, Coolidge announced that he would not seek re-election. Dawes again favored Frank Lowden at the [[1928 Republican National Convention]], but the convention chose [[Herbert Hoover]].<ref name="dawesvp1"/> Rumors circulated about Dawes being chosen as Hoover's running mate.  Coolidge made it known that he would consider the renomination of Dawes as vice president to be an insult. [[Charles Curtis]] of Kansas, known for his skills in collaboration, was chosen as Hoover's running mate.<ref>{{Cite book | last = Mencken | first = Henry Louis | author-link1 = H. L.

==Court of St. James's and the RFC==
After Dawes completed his term as vice president, he served as the [[U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] (known formally as the [[Court of St. James's]]) from 1929 to 1931.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Dunlap|first=Annette B.|title=Charles Gates Dawes: a Life|pages=221–44}}</ref> Overall, Dawes was an effective ambassador, as [[George V]]'s son, the future [[Edward VIII]], later confirmed in his memoirs.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Dawes was rather rough-hewn for some of his duties, disliking presenting American débutantes to the King. On his first visit to the royal court, in deference to American public opinion, he refused to wear the customary Court dress, which then included knee breeches. This episode was said to upset the King, who had been prevented by illness from attending the event.

As the [[Great Depression]] continued to ravage the US, Dawes accepted President [[Herbert Hoover]]'s appeal to leave diplomatic office and head the newly-created [[Reconstruction Finance Corporation]] (RFC). After a few months, Dawes resigned from the RFC. As chairman of the failing Central Republic Bank and Trust Company of Chicago, he felt obligated to work for its rescue. Political opponents alleged that, under Dawes's leadership, the RFC had given preferential treatment to his bank. This marked the end of Dawes's career in public service. For the [[1932 United States presidential election|1932 election]], Hoover considered the possibility of adding Dawes to the ticket in place of Curtis, but Dawes declined the potential offer.<ref name="witcover">{{cite book|last1=Witcover|first1=Jules|title=The American Vice Presidency|date=2014|publisher=Smithsonian Books|page=296}}</ref>

Later in 1932, Dawes and associates formed the City National Bank and Trust Co. to take over the deposits of the failed Central Republic Bank and Trust Company.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1932/10/07/archives/dawess-new-bank-opens-in-chicago-city-national-and-trust-has.html|title=DAWES'S NEW BANK OPENS IN CHICAGO; City National and Trust Has $4,000,000 Capital and $1,000,000 Surplus.

<blockquote> 
The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 9, 1918, takes pleasure in presenting the Army Distinguished Service Medal to Brigadier General Charles G. Dawes, United States Army, for exceptionally meritorious and distinguished services to the Government of the United States, in a duty of great responsibility during World War I. General Dawes rendered most conspicuous services in the organization of the General Purchasing Board as General Purchasing Agent of the American Expeditionary Forces and as the Representative of the U.S. Army on the Military Board of Allied Supply. His rare abilities, sound business judgment, and aggressive energy were invaluable in securing needed supplies for the Allied armies in Europe.  (War Department, General Orders No. 12 (1919))

==Legacy==
According to Annette Dunlap, Dawes was:
:a  self-made  man  who  valued  hard  work and thriftiness tempered with Christian generosity. He spent his life promoting solid Republican values of small government with restrained budgets. Franklin Roosevelt’s philosophy  of  big  government  spending  was anathema to him.<ref>Cited in ''Indiana Magazine of History,'' (2018) 114(1) p. 76. </ref> 

In 1944, he bequeathed his lakeshore home in Evanston to [[Northwestern University]] for the Evanston Historical Society (later renamed the Evanston History Center). Dawes lived in the house until his death. The Dawes family continued to occupy it until the death of Mrs. Dawes in 1957. Since then, the Evanston History Center operates out of the house and manages it as a museum. Designated a [[National Historic Landmark]], the [[Charles G. Dawes House]] is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].
