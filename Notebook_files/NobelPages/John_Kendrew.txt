Kendrew shared the 1962 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] with [[Max Perutz]], for their work at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] to investigate the structure of [[heme]]-containing [[protein]]s.

==Education and early life==
Kendrew was born in [[Oxford]], son of [[Wilfrid George Kendrew]], [[reader (academic rank)|reader]] in [[climatology]] in the [[University of Oxford]], and [[Evelyn Sandberg-Vavalà|Evelyn May Graham Sandburg]], art historian. After prep school at the [[Dragon School]] in Oxford, he was educated at [[Clifton College]]<ref>"Clifton College Register" Muirhead, J.A.O. p462: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948</ref> in [[Bristol]], 1930–1936. He attended [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in 1936, as a Major Scholar, graduating in chemistry in 1939. He spent the early months of [[World War II]] doing research on reaction kinetics, and then became a member of the Air Ministry Research Establishment, working on [[radar]]. In 1940 he became engaged in operational research at the [[Royal Air Force]] headquarters; commissioned a [[squadron leader]] on 17 September 1941,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=35301|supp=|page=5793|date=7 October 1941}}</ref> he was appointed an honorary wing commander on 8 June 1944,<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=36633|supp=y|page=3562|date=28 July 1944}}</ref> and relinquished his commission on 5 June 1945.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=37168|supp=y|page=3552|date=6 July 1945}}</ref> He was awarded his PhD after the war in 1949.<ref name=kphd>{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Cambridge|title=X-ray studies of certain crystalline proteins : the crystal structure of foetal and adult sheep haemoglobins and of horse myoglobin|first= John Cowdery|last=Kendrew|date=1949|url=http://ulmss-newton.lib.cam.ac.uk/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=39466|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.648050}}|website=lib.cam.ac.uk}}</ref>

==Research and career==
During the war years, he became increasingly interested in biochemical problems, and decided to work on the structure of proteins.

===Crystallography===
In 1945 he approached [[Max Perutz]] in the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] in [[Cambridge]]. [[Joseph Barcroft]], a respiratory physiologist, suggested he might make a comparative protein crystallographic study of adult and fetal sheep [[hemoglobin]], and he started that work.

In 1947 he became a Fellow of [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|Peterhouse]]; and the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC) agreed to create a research unit for the study of the molecular structure of biological systems, under the direction of Sir [[Lawrence Bragg]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} In 1954 he became a Reader at the Davy-Faraday Laboratory of the [[Royal Institution]] in [[London]].

===Crystal structure of myoglobin===
[[File:KendrewMyoglobin.jpg|thumb|300px|John Kendrew with model of myoglobin in progress. Copyright by the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England.]]
Kendrew shared the 1962 [[Nobel Prize]] for [[chemistry]] with [[Max Perutz]] for determining the first atomic structures of [[protein]]s using [[X-ray crystallography]]. Their work was done at what is now the [[MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology]] in [[Cambridge]]. Kendrew determined the structure of the protein [[myoglobin]], which stores oxygen in [[muscle]] [[cell (biology)|cells]]. On Saturday 20 October 1962 the award of Nobel prizes to John Kendrew and Max Perutz, and to Crick, Watson, and Wilkins was satirised in a short sketch in the BBC TV programme ''[[That Was The Week That Was]]'' with the Nobel Prizes being referred to as 'The Alfred Nobel Peace Pools'.

In 1947 the MRC agreed to make a research unit for the Study of the Molecular Structure of Biological Systems. The original studies were on the structure of sheep [[hemoglobin]], but when this work had progressed as far as was possible using the resources then available, Kendrew embarked on the study of [[myoglobin]], a molecule only a quarter the size of the hemoglobin molecule. His initial source of raw material was [[horse]] heart, but the crystals thus obtained were too small for X-ray analysis. Kendrew realized that the oxygen-conserving tissue of [[diving mammals]] could offer a better prospect, and a chance encounter led to his acquiring a large chunk of [[whale meat]] from Peru. Whale myoglobin did give large crystals with clean X-ray diffraction patterns. However, the problem still remained insurmountable, until in 1953 [[Max Perutz]] discovered that the [[phase problem]] in analysis of the diffraction patterns could be solved by [[multiple isomorphous replacement]] — comparison of patterns from several crystals; one from the native protein, and others that had been soaked in solutions of heavy metals and had metal ions introduced in different well-defined positions. An electron density map at 6 [[angstrom]] (0.6 [[nanometre]]) resolution was obtained by 1957, and by 1959 an atomic model could be built at 2 angstrom (0.2&nbsp;nm) resolution.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=18990802 |title=Structure of myoglobin: A three-dimensional Fourier synthesis at 2 A. resolution. | doi=10.1038/185422a0 | volume=185 |date=February 1960 |journal=Nature |pages=422–7 | last1 = Kendrew | first1 = JC | last2 = Dickerson | first2 = RE | last3 = Strandberg | first3 = BE |issue=4711 |display-authors=etal|bibcode=1960Natur.185..422K |s2cid=4167651 }}</ref>

===Later career===
In 1963, Kendrew became one of the founders of the [[European Molecular Biology Organization]]; as well, he founded and was for many years editor-in-chief of the [[Journal of Molecular Biology]]. He became Fellow of the American Society of Biological Chemists in 1967 and honorary member of the [[International Academy of Science, Munich]]. In 1974, he succeeded in persuading governments to establish the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] (EMBL) in [[Heidelberg]] and became its first director.  He was knighted in 1974.<ref name="frs"/> From 1974 to 1979, he was a Trustee of the [[British Museum]], and from 1974 to 1988 he was successively Secretary General, Vice-President, and President of the [[International Council of Scientific Unions]].

After his retirement from EMBL, Kendrew became President of [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]] at the [[University of Oxford]], a post he held from 1981 to 1987.  In his will, he designated his bequest to St John's College for studentships in science and in music, for students from developing countries.  The ''Kendrew Quadrangle'' at St John's College in Oxford, officially opened on 16 October 2010, is named after him.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.sjc.ox.ac.uk/discover/about-college/college-buildings/21st-century/ | title=The 21st Century: Kendrew Quadrangle | publisher=St John's College, Oxford | year=2020 | access-date=2 June 2020}}</ref>

Kendrew was married to the former Elizabeth Jarvie (née Gorvin) from 1948 to 1956.  Their marriage ended in divorce.  Kendrew was subsequently partners with the artist Ruth Harris.<ref name="frs"/> He left no survivors.<ref>{{cite news | author=Wolfgang Saxon | title=John C.
