'''Werner Arber''' (born June 3, 1929 in [[Gränichen]], [[Aargau]])<ref name="nobelprize1978"/> is a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[microbiologist]] and [[geneticist]]. Along with American researchers [[Hamilton O. Smith|Hamilton Smith]] and [[Daniel Nathans]], Werner Arber shared the 1978 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for the discovery of [[restriction endonucleases]]. Their work would lead to the development of [[recombinant DNA]] technology.

==Life and career==
[[File:Lettres Daisy Dussoix 1978.pdf|thumb|Letters from Daisy Dussoix in 1978 where she expresses her frustration about the lack of recognition of her research which led Werner Arber to obtain the Nobel prize]]
Arber studied [[chemistry]] and [[physics]] at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] in [[Zürich]] from 1949 to 1953. Late in 1953, he took an assistantship for electron microscopy at the [[University of Geneva]], in time left the electron microscope, went on to research [[bacteriophage]]s and write his dissertation on defective [[Lambda phage|lambda]] prophage mutants. In his Nobel Autobiography, he writes:

<blockquote>In the summer of 1956, we learned about experiments made by [[Larry Morse]] and Esther and Joshua Lederberg on the lambda-mediated transduction (gene transfer from one bacterial strain to another by a bacteriophage serving as vector) of bacterial determinants for galactose fermentation. Since these investigators had encountered defective lysogenic strains among their transductants, we felt that such strains should be included in the collection of lambda prophage mutants under study in our laboratory. Very rapidly, thanks to the stimulating help by [[Jean Weigle]] and [[Grete Kellenberger-Gujer|Grete Kellenberger]], this turned out to be extremely fruitful. ... This was the end of my career as an electron microscopist and in chosing {{sic}} genetic and physiological approaches I became a molecular geneticist.
</blockquote>

He received his doctorate in 1958 from the University of Geneva.

Arber then worked at the [[University of Southern California]] in phage genetics with Gio ("Joe") Bertani starting in the summer of 1958.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cartage.org.lb/en/themes/biographies/mainbiographies/A/Arber/Arber.htm |title=Arber, Werner |publisher=Cartage.org.lb |date=1929-06-03 |access-date=2012-09-09}}</ref> Late in 1959 he accepted an offer to return to Geneva at the beginning of 1960, but only after spending "several very fruitful weeks"<ref name="nobelprize1978">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1978/arber-autobio.html |title=Werner Arber - Autobiography |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=1929-06-03 |access-date=2012-09-09}}</ref> at each of the laboratories of [[Gunther Stent]] ([[University of California, Berkeley]]), [[Joshua Lederberg]] and [[Esther Lederberg]]<ref>Again from Arber's Nobel Autobiography: "One of the first experiments after my return to Geneva was to render E. coli B and its radiation resistant strain B/r sensitive to phage lambda. The first step to accomplish this was easy thanks to a hint received from Esther Lederberg to look for cotransduction of the Ma1+ and lambdaS characters."</ref> ([[Stanford University]]) and [[Salvador Luria]] ([[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]).

Back at the University of Geneva, Arber worked in a laboratory in the basement of the Physics Institute, where he carried out productive research and hosted "a number of first class graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and senior scientists." including [[Daisy Roulland-Dussoix|Daisy Roulland Dussoix]],<ref name="nobelprize1978"/> whose work helped him to later obtain the Nobel Prize.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.estherlederberg.com/Censorship/Gender%20Discrimination%205.html|title=Esther M.

In 1971, after spending a year as a visiting professor in the Department of [[Molecular Biology]] of the University of California in Berkeley, Arber moved to the [[University of Basel]]. In Basel, he was one of the first persons to work in the newly constructed [[Biozentrum University of Basel|Biozentrum]], which housed the departments of biophysics, biochemistry, microbiology, structural biology, cell biology and pharmacology and was thus conducive to interdisciplinary research.

On 27 occasions since 1981, Werner Arber has shared his expertise and passion for science with young scientists at the [[Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org/meetings/laureate-arber#page=1&sort=4&opt=desc&pagesize=3|title=Werner Arber - Meetings|website=www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org|access-date=2017-12-21}}</ref>

Werner Arber is member of the [http://www.wkdialogue.ch World Knowledge Dialogue] Scientific Board and of the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]] since 1981.  In 1981, Arber became a founding member of the [[World Cultural Council]].<ref>{{cite web | title = About Us | publisher = [[World Cultural Council]] | url = http://www.consejoculturalmundial.org/about-us/ | access-date = November 8, 2016}}</ref> He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1984.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=22 April 2011}}</ref> Pope Benedict XVI appointed him as President of the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]] in January 2011, making him the first Protestant to hold the position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/world/view/20110116-314700/Vatican-appoints-Protestant-as-scientific-bodys-head |title=Vatican appoints Protestant as scientific body's head - INQUIRER.net, Philippine News for Filipinos |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2011-01-16 |access-date=2012-09-09}}</ref>  In 2017, Arber retired as President of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences and was replaced by German scientist [[Joachim von Braun]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2017/06/23/new-head-pontifical-academy-science-natural-francis-choice/ |title = New head of Pontifical Academy of Science a natural Francis choice|date = 2017-06-23}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Arber is married and has two daughters.

Arber is a Christian and theistic evolutionist, stating "The most primitive cells may require at least several hundred different specific biological macromolecules. How such already quite complex structures may have come together, remains a mystery to me. The possibility of the existence of a Creator, of God, represents to me a satisfactory solution to this problem."<ref>Arber, W. 1992. ''The Existence of a Creator Represents a Satisfactory Solution.'' In Margenau, H. and R. A. Varghese (eds.), ''Cosmos, Bios, Theos: Scientists Reflect on Science, God, and the Origins of the Universe, Life, and Homo sapiens.'' La Salle, IL: Open Court, p. 141-142.</ref> In addition, he has affirmed: "I know that the concept of God helped me to master many questions in life; it guides me in critical situations, and I see it confirmed in many deep insights into the beauty of the functioning of the world."<ref>Arber, W. 1992. ''The Existence of a Creator Represents a Satisfactory Solution.'' In Margenau, H. and R. A. Varghese (eds.), ''Cosmos, Bios, Theos: Scientists Reflect on Science, God, and the Origins of the Universe, Life, and Homo sapiens.'' La Salle, IL: Open Court, p. 143.</ref>
