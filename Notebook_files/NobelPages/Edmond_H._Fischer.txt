'''Edmond Henri Fischer''' (April 6, 1920 – August 27, 2021) was an American-Swiss biochemist. He and his collaborator [[Edwin G. Krebs]] were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1992 for describing how reversible [[phosphorylation]] works as a switch to activate [[protein]]s and regulate various cellular processes.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1992 Press Release |publisher=[[Nobel Assembly at Karolinska Institutet]] |url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1992/press.html|access-date=August 21, 2013}}</ref>  From 2007 until 2014, he was the Honorary President of the [[World Cultural Council]].<ref>{{cite web|title=World Cultural Council 24th Award Ceremony, Closing Remarks |url=http://www.consejoculturalmundial.org/memories-ceremony2007-ClosingCarlosAlmadaLopez.php |language=es |last=Almada López |first=Carlos |access-date=August 21, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225231035/http://www.consejoculturalmundial.org/memories-ceremony2007-ClosingCarlosAlmadaLopez.php |archive-date=December 25, 2014 }}</ref><ref>Pacific Northwest Research Institute.

== Early life ==
Fischer was born on April 6, 1920, in the [[Shanghai International Settlement]], [[Republic of China (1912–49)|China]].<ref name=schudel>{{citation |last=Schudel |first=Matt |title=Edmond Fischer, who won Nobel Prize for discoveries about proteins in cells, dies at 101 | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=August 31, 2021 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/edmond-fischer-dead/2021/08/31/e7f3c848-0a6b-11ec-a6dd-296ba7fb2dce_story.html}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> His mother, Renée Tapernoux, was born in France, and his father, Oscar Fischer, was born in Austria.<ref>{{Cite book | url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/edmond-h-fischer-wap/ |title = Edmond H.

At age seven, Fischer and his two elder brothers, Raoul and George,<ref>Oscar Fischer's biography in Men of Shanghai and North China, p129</ref> were sent to the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] boarding school [[La Châtaigneraie (school)|La Châtaigneraie]], near his mother's hometown in [[Vevey]]. He picked up mountain climbing and skiing during his time at the school.<ref name=":0" /> At high school he made a pact with a childhood friend, one of them would become a doctor and the other a scientist and then they could cure the ills of the world.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|date=August 31, 2021|title=In Memoriam: Nobel Laureate Edmond Fischer|url=https://newsroom.uw.edu/news/memoriam-nobel-laureate-edmond-fischer|access-date=September 3, 2021|website=newsroom.uw.edu}}</ref> While at high school Fischer was admitted to the [[Conservatoire de Musique de Genève|Geneva Conservatory of Music]] as a pianist and he also considered becoming a professional musician.<ref name=":0" />

At the completion of high school, Fischer wanted to study [[microbiology]] inspired by the works of French chemist and microbiologist [[Louis Pasteur]] and partly driven by his father's death from [[tuberculosis]];<ref name=":0" /> however, he was advised to study chemistry. He studied at the [[University of Geneva]] during [[World War II]], he enjoyed organic chemistry and also studied biology. He completed a [[PhD]] in organic chemistry under the supervision of [[Kurt Heinrich Meyer]], who worked on the structure of [[polysaccharides]], and the [[enzyme]]s needed for their synthesis and breakdown. Fischer worked on alpha-[[amylase]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Edmond H.|last2=Piguet|first2=Alfred|date=December 1, 2009|title=Macromolecules and Enzymes: The Geneva Heritage from Kurt H.

==Career and research==
After his PhD, Fischer went to the United States in 1950 for [[postdoctoral research]]. He was supposed to take up a position at [[Caltech]], but he was also, unexpectedly, offered a position at the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]]. Seattle reminded Fischer and his wife of Switzerland so they chose to settle there.<ref name=haydon>{{cite web | last = Haydon | first = Ian | title=In Memoriam: Nobel Laureate Edmond Fischer|url=https://newsroom.uw.edu/news/memoriam-nobel-laureate-edmond-fischer| date=August 31, 2021}}</ref>

=== Reversible protein phosphorylation ===
Six months after his arrival in Seattle, Fischer learnt of fellow biochemist from the same university, [[Edwin G. Krebs]], who was also trying to answer a similar question on where muscles received the energy that they needed to contract. Fischer began collaborating with Krebs, and the duo began their investigations on [[glycogen phosphorylase]], an enzyme that had been discovered by the husband and wife pair of [[Gerty Cori]] and [[Carl Ferdinand Cori]] who had won the [[Nobel Prize]] for the discovery in 1947.<ref name=":0" /> Krebs had earlier studied the enzyme in the muscle tissue, while Fischer had studied the enzyme in a potato. The duo realized a discrepancy in that the enzyme in the muscle required an additional chemical to function, while the potato did not require that additional chemical.<ref name=":0" /> Krebs and Fischer defined a series of reactions leading to the activation/inactivation of this enzyme as triggered by [[hormone]]s and [[calcium]], and in the process discovering reversible protein phosphorylation. They had discovered that the muscle enzyme was regulated by the addition and removal of [[phosphate group]]s in a process called [[Phosphorylation|reversible phosphorylation]].<ref name=":0" />

Explained simply, reversible protein phosphorylation works like this: a [[protein kinase]] moves a [[phosphate]] group from [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP) to a protein, converting it to [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP). The shape and the function of this protein is thus altered enabling it to take part in converting [[glycogen]] into [[glucose]] which is used for fuel for muscular contractions. When the protein has completed its role a different protein [[phosphatase]] removes the phosphate and the protein reverts to its original state. This cycle takes place to control an enormous number of metabolic processes.<ref>{{Citation

While the importance of the discovery was not fully recognised in 1955, the discovery became core to explaining one of the fundamental mechanisms  that cells use to communicate with one another.<ref name=":0" /> [[Phosphorylation]] determines how a cell grows, divides, differentiates and eventually dies. The reaction also regulates hormones and proliferation of cancerous cells.<ref name=":0" /> The regulation of phosphorylation was determined to be key to understanding diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and heart disease. Many modern drugs build on the work done by Fischer and Krebs including attempting to manipulate the process. For the discovery of reversible protein phosphorylation, Fischer and Krebs were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine in 1992, for explaining how the reaction acted as a switch to activate proteins and regulate various biochemical cellular processes.<ref name="schudel" /><ref name=":1" />

Throughout his career, Fischer's research continued to look at the role of reversible protein phosphorylation in a variety of cellular processes.<ref name=":0" />

== Personal life ==
Fischer married his first wife, Nelly Gagnaux, in 1948 and they remained married until her death in 1961. He married Beverly Bullock in 1963 who died in 2006.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> Fischer played the piano and often performed sonatas by [[Beethoven]] and [[Mozart]] for his friends.<ref name=":0" /> He also held a private pilots license and enjoyed flying.<ref name=":1" />

Fischer died on August 27, 2021, in [[Seattle]], Washington. He was aged 101.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=schudel />

== Awards and honors ==
Fischer won numerous awards including the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1992. He was elected a  [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 2010|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2010]].<ref name="formemrs" /> He was awarded the Werner Prize from the Swiss Chemical Society, the Lederle Medical Faculty Award, the Prix Jaubert from the University of Geneva, the Senior Passano Award and the Steven C. Beering Award from Indiana University. He received Doctorates Honoris Causa from the University of Montpellier, France and the University of Basel, Switzerland.<ref name="nobelbio" /> He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1972<ref name="formemrs" /> and a Member of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1973.<ref name="nas">{{cite web |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151010212856/http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/members/55748.html |archive-date=October 10, 2015 |url = http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/members/55748.html |publisher=nasonline.org |title = Edmond H.
