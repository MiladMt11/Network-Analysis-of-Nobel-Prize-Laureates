After completing his doctoral research at [[Nagoya University]] in 1972, Kobayashi worked as a research associate on particle physics at [[Kyoto University]].  Together, with his colleague [[Toshihide Maskawa]], he worked on explaining [[CP-violation]] within the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics.  Kobayashi and Maskawa's theory required that there were at least three [[generation (physics)|generations]] of quarks, a prediction that was confirmed experimentally four years later by the discovery of the [[bottom quark]].
