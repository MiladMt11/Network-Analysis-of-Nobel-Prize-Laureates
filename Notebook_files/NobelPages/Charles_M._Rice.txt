== Career ==
After his postdoctoral work, Rice moved with his research group to the [[Washington University School of Medicine]] in 1986, where he remained until 2001.<ref name=":1" />

Rice has been the Maurice R. and Corinne P. Greenberg Professor at Rockefeller University since 2001. He is also an adjunct professor at [[Washington University School of Medicine]] and [[Cornell University]]. He has served on committees for the [[Food and Drug Administration]], [[National Institutes of Health]], and [[World Health Organization]].<ref name=CV/>

He was the editor of ''[[Journal of Experimental Medicine]]'' from 2003 to 2007, ''[[Journal of Virology]]'' from 2003 to 2008, and ''[[PLoS Pathogens]]'' from 2005 to present. He has been an author of over 400 peer-reviewed publications.<ref name=CV/>

== Research ==
[[File:15 Hegasy Nobel Prize 2020 HepC.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2020: Seminal experiments by HJ Alter, M Houghton and CM Rice leading to the discovery of HCV as the causative agent of non-A, non-B hepatitis.]]
While at Caltech, he was involved in researching the genome of [[Sindbis virus]] and the establishment of [[flaviviruses]] as their own family of viruses. The strain of [[yellow fever virus]] he used for this work was eventually used for the development of the yellow fever vaccine. While exploring Sindbis virus at Washington University in St. Louis, Rice described how he produced infectious flavivirus [[RNA]] in the laboratory in a 1989 paper published in ''The New Biologist''. The paper attracted the attention of [[Stephen Feinstone]] who was studying [[hepatitis C virus]] and suggested that Rice use the technique to develop a vaccine for [[hepatitis C]]. In 1997, Rice cultured the first infectious clone of hepatitis C virus for use in studies on chimpanzees in whom the virus was also endemic. In 2005, Rice was also part of a team that showed that a strain of an acute form of the virus identified in a human patient can be forced to replicate in a laboratory setting. Rice's contribution to hepatitis C research has earned him many awards.<ref name=pmid21502493/>
