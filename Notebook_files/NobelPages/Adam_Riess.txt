'''Adam Guy Riess''' (born December 16, 1969) is an American [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]] and [[Bloomberg Distinguished Professorships|Bloomberg Distinguished Professor]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]] and the [[Space Telescope Science Institute]]. He is known for his research in using [[supernovae]] as cosmological probes. Riess shared both the 2006 [[Shaw Prize|Shaw Prize in Astronomy]] and the [[2011 Nobel Prize in Physics]] with [[Saul Perlmutter]] and [[Brian P. Schmidt]] for providing evidence that the [[Accelerating universe|expansion of the universe is accelerating]].

==Family==
Riess was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], one of three children.<ref>{{cite news|title=WEDDINGS; Nancy Schondorf And Adam Riess|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/11/style/weddings-nancy-schondorf-and-adam-riess.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=January 11, 1998}}</ref><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/18/style/dr-gail-riess-is-married.html Wedding: Drs.

==Education==
He attended [[Watchung Hills Regional High School]], graduating in the class of 1988.<ref>Spivey, Mark.

"Riess, who grew up in Warren, gave a shout-out to retired teacher Jeff Charney, saying his interest in science first was piqued at Watchung Hills."</ref> He also attended the prestigious New Jersey Governor's School in the Sciences in 1987. Riess then graduated from [[The Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1992 where he was a member of the [[Phi Delta Theta]] fraternity. He received his [[PhD#United States|PhD]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1996; it resulted in measurements of over twenty new type Ia supernovae and a method to utilize [[Type Ia supernova]]e as accurate distance indicators by correcting for intervening dust and intrinsic inhomogeneities. Riess's PhD thesis was supervised by [[Robert Kirshner]] and [[William H. Press]] and won the [[Robert J. Trumpler Award]] in 1999 for PhD theses of unusual importance to astronomy.<ref>{{cite book |last=Panek |first=Richard |title=The 4% Universe: Dark Matter, Dark Energy, and the Race to Discover the Rest of Reality |year=2011 |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]] |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-618-98244-8}}, pg. 174</ref>

==Research==
Riess was a [[Miller Fellow]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], before moving on to the [[Space Telescope Science Institute]] in 1999. He took up his current position at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 2006. He also sits on the selection committee for the Astronomy award, given under the auspices of the [[Shaw Prize]]. In July 2016, Riess was named a [[Bloomberg Distinguished Professorships|Bloomberg Distinguished Professor]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]] for his accomplishments as an interdisciplinary researcher and excellence in teaching the next generation of scholars.<ref>Messersmith, Julie.

Riess jointly led the study with [[Brian Schmidt]] in 1998 for the [[High-z Supernova Search Team]] which first reported evidence that the universe's expansion rate is now accelerating through monitoring of Type Ia supernovae. The team's observations were contrary to the current theory that the expansion of the universe was slowing down; instead, by monitoring the color shifts in the light from supernovae from Earth, they discovered that these billion-year old novae were still accelerating.<ref name="bbc nobel"/> This result was also found nearly simultaneously by the [[Supernova Cosmology Project]], led by [[Saul Perlmutter]].<ref name="bbc nobel">{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15165371 | title = Nobel physics prize honours accelerating Universe find | first =Jason | last = Palmer | date = October 4, 2011 | access-date = October 5, 2011 | publisher = [[BBC]] }}</ref> The corroborating evidence between the two competing studies led to the acceptance of the [[accelerating universe]] theory, and initiated new research to understand the nature of the universe, such as the existence of [[dark energy]].<ref name="bbc nobel"/> The discovery of the accelerating universe was named 'Breakthrough of the Year' by ''Science'' magazine in 1998,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bloom|first=Floyd E. |title=Breakthroughs 1998 |journal=Science |date=18 Dec 1998 |volume=282 |issue=5397 |page=2193 |doi=10.1126/science.282.5397.2193 |bibcode=1998Sci...282.2193B |s2cid=220092189 |url=https://science.sciencemag.org/content/282/5397/2193 |access-date=27 November 2020}}</ref> and Riess was jointly awarded the [[2011 Nobel Prize in Physics]] along with Schmidt and Perlmutter for their groundbreaking work.<ref name="bbc nobel"/>

In the book ''[[The 4 Percent Universe]]'', scientific journalist [[Richard Panek]] claims that Riess made improper use of the supernova data collected by the [[Calán/Tololo Survey]], publishing them prior to the authors and without their permission.<ref>{{cite book |last=Panek |first=Richard |title=The 4 Percent Universe |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]  |date=2011 |isbn=978-0-618-98244-8}}</ref> However, coincident publication dates and acknowledgements in one of these publications contradict this claim.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Riess|first=Adam|title=Using Type Ia Supernova Light Curve Shapes to Measure the Hubble Constant|journal= The Astrophysical Journal|volume=438|pages=L17|bibcode=1995ApJ...438L..17R|year=1995|arxiv=astro-ph/9410054|doi=10.1086/187704|s2cid=118938423}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |bibcode = 1995AJ....109....1H|title = A Hubble Diagram of Distant Type 1a Supernovae|journal = The Astronomical Journal|volume = 109|pages = 1|last1 = Hamuy|first1 = Mario|last2 = Phillips|first2 = M.
