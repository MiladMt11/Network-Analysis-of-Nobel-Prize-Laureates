== Research ==
Wilson is known for research and teaching on market design, pricing, negotiation, and related topics concerning industrial organization and information economics. He is an expert on game theory and its applications. He has been a major contributor to auction designs and competitive bidding strategies in the oil, communication, and power industries, and to the design of innovative pricing schemes. His work on pricing of priority service for electric power has been implemented in the utility industry.<ref name="Robert Wilson"/><ref name="Robert Wilson {{!}} SIEPR">{{Cite web|title=Robert Wilson {{!}} SIEPR|url=https://siepr.stanford.edu/events/speakers/robert-wilson|access-date=October 18, 2020|website=siepr.stanford.edu|archive-date=December 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191213084007/https://siepr.stanford.edu/events/speakers/robert-wilson|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics ===
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences awarded Wilson and Paul Milgrom as the co-recipients of the 2020 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for having "improved auction theory and invented new auction formats, beneftting sellers, buyers and taxpayers around the world".<ref name=nobelpressrelease /> [[Alvin E. Roth|Alvin Roth]] (an economist who was a co-recipient of the 2012 Nobel Memorial Prize and who had Wilson as his doctoral advisor) said that Wilson and Milgrom "haven't just profoundly changed the way we understand auctions{{Spaced en dash}}they have changed how things are auctioned."<ref>{{cite news | last = Smialek | first = Jeanna | title = U.S. Auction Theorists Win the 2020 Nobel in Economics: Paul Milgrom and Robert Wilson were honored for work that has pushed auctions into new and useful territory | newspaper = The New York Times | date = October 12, 2020 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/business/nobel-economics-paul-milgrom-robert-wilson.html | access-date = October 13, 2020 | archive-date = October 13, 2020 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20201013002322/https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/business/nobel-economics-paul-milgrom-robert-wilson.html | url-status = live }}</ref> Specifically, the Academy acknowledged Wilson's efforts in analyzing common value auctions, where bidders derive a common value from the underlying resource, and his theoretical proofs that bidders tend to bid lower than their best estimates of common value, in order to avoid the [[winner's curse]]. Some examples of common value auctions include radio frequency spectrum, and minerals.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2020|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2020/press-release/|access-date=October 18, 2020|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|archive-date=October 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201014221855/https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2020/press-release/|url-status=live}}</ref>
