He was awarded a [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 2018, along with [[Donna Strickland]], for the invention of [[chirped pulse amplification]], a technique later used to create ultrashort-pulse, very high-intensity ([[petawatt]]) laser pulses.<ref name=Michigan_Profile>{{cite web |url=http://www.engin.umich.edu/research/cuos/ResearchGroups/HFS/Profiles/Gerard_Mourou.html |title=Gérard Mourou |date=2 October 2018 |publisher=University of Michigan |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080905085848/http://www.engin.umich.edu/research/cuos/ResearchGroups/HFS/Profiles/Gerard_Mourou.html |archive-date=5 September 2008 }}</ref>

In 1994, Mourou and his team at the [[University of Michigan]] discovered that the balance between the self-focusing refraction (see [[Kerr effect]]) and self-attenuating [[diffraction]] by [[ionization]] and rarefaction of a laser beam of terawatt intensities in the atmosphere creates "filaments" which act as [[waveguide]]s for the beam, thus preventing divergence.

==Career==
Mourou has been director of the Laboratoire d'optique appliquée at the [[ENSTA]] from 2005 to 2009. He is a professor and member of Haut Collège at the [[École Polytechnique|École polytechnique]] and A. D. Moore Distinguished University Professor Emeritus at the [[University of Michigan]] where he has taught for over 16 years. He was the founding director of the Center for Ultrafast Optical Science at the University of Michigan in 1990. He had previously led a research group on ultrafast sciences at Laboratoire d'optique appliquée of ENSTA and École polytechnique, after obtaining a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree from [[Pierre and Marie Curie University]] in 1973. He then went to the United States and became a professor at the [[University of Rochester]] in 1977, where he and his then student [[Donna Strickland]] produced their Nobel prize-winning work in the [[Laboratory for Laser Energetics]] at the university.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/rochesters-breakthrough-in-laser-science-earns-nobel-prize-340302/ |title=Rochester breakthrough in laser science earns Nobel Prize |date=2 October 2018 |website=University of Rochester |access-date=4 October 2018}}</ref> The pair co-invented [[chirped pulse amplification]], a "method of generating high-intensity, ultra-short optical pulses".<ref name="bbc2">{{cite news |last1=Murphy |first1=Jessica |title=Donna Strickland: The 'laser jock' Nobel prize winner |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45722890 |access-date=2 October 2018 |work=BBC News |date=2 October 2018}}</ref> Strickland's doctoral thesis was on "development of an ultra-bright laser and an application to multi-photon ionization".<ref name="Thesis">{{cite thesis |last=Strickland |first=Donna Theo |author-link=Donna Strickland |date=1988 |title=Development of an ultra-bright laser and an application to multi-photon ionization |type=PhD |publisher=University of Rochester |url=http://www.lle.rochester.edu/media/publications/documents/theses/Strickland.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130707150743/http://www.lle.rochester.edu/media/publications/documents/theses/Strickland.pdf |archive-date=7 July 2013 |access-date=6 October 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

On 2 October 2018, Mourou and [[Donna Strickland|Strickland]] were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, for their joint work on [[chirped pulse amplification]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/02/arthur-ashkin-gerard-mourou-and-donna-strickland-win-nobel-physics-prize |title=Arthur Ashkin, Gérard Mourou and Donna Strickland win Nobel physics prize |first=Ian |last=Sample |date=2 October 2018 |journal=The Guardian |access-date=2 October 2018}}</ref> They shared half of the Prize, while the other half was awarded to [[Arthur Ashkin]] for his invention of "optical tweezers that grab particles, atoms, viruses and other living cells with their laser beam fingers".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/arthur-ashkin-2-others-win-nobel-physics-prize-for-laser-research/ |title=Arthur Ashkin, 2 others win Nobel Physics Prize for laser research |date=2 October 2018 |website=Times of Israel |access-date=2 October 2018}}</ref><ref name="physicsworld.com">{{cite web |url=https://physicsworld.com/a/arthur-ashkin-gerard-mourou-and-donna-strickland-the-nobel-prize-for-physics/ |title=Arthur Ashkin, Gérard Mourou and Donna Strickland win the Nobel Prize for Physics – Physics World |date=2 October 2018 |access-date=2 October 2018}}</ref>

Mourou and Strickland found that stretching a laser out reduced its peak power, which could then be greatly amplified using normal instruments.
It could then be compressed to create the short-lived, highly powerful lasers they were after.<ref name="physicsworld.com" /> The technique, which was described in Strickland's first scientific publication, came to be known as chirped pulse amplification (CPA). They were probably unaware at the time that their tools would make it possible to study natural phenomena in unprecedented ways.<ref name="auto">{{cite web |url=https://physicsworld.com/a/arthur-ashkin-gerard-mourou-and-donna-strickland-the-nobel-prize-for-physics/ |title=Arthur Ashkin, Gérard Mourou and Donna Strickland win the Nobel Prize for Physics |date=2 October 2018 |access-date=2 October 2018}}</ref> CPA could also per definition be used to create a laser pulse that only lasts one attosecond, one-billionth of a billionth of a second. At those timescales, it became possible not only to study chemical reactions, but what happens inside individual atoms.<ref name="auto" />

''[[The Guardian]]'' and [[Scientific American]] provided simplified summaries of the work of Strickland and Mourou: it "paved the way for the shortest, most intense laser beams ever created". "The ultrabrief, ultrasharp beams can be used to make extremely precise cuts so their technique is now used in laser machining and enables doctors to perform millions of corrective" [[laser eye surgery|laser eye surgeries]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Physics Nobel prize won by Arthur Ashkin, Gérard Mourou and Donna Strickland |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/oct/02/arthur-ashkin-gerard-mourou-and-donna-strickland-win-nobel-physics-prize |access-date=2 October 2018 |work=The Guardian |date=2 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title='Optical Tweezers' and Tools Used for Laser Eye Surgery Snag Physics Nobel |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/optical-tweezers-and-tools-used-for-laser-eye-surgery-snag-physics-nobel1/ |access-date=2 October 2018 |publisher=Scientific American |date=2 October 2018}}</ref> Canadian Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]] acknowledged the achievements of Mourou and Strickland: "Their innovative work can be found in applications including corrective eye surgery, and is expected to have a significant impact on cancer therapy and other physics research in the future".<ref>[https://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2018/10/02/statement-prime-minister-donna-strickland-winning-nobel-prize-physics Statement by the Prime Minister on Donna Strickland winning the Nobel Prize in Physics 2 October 2018 PMO]</ref>
