==Education==
Henderson was educated at Newcastleton primary school, [[Hawick High School]] and [[Boroughmuir High School]].<ref name=whoswho/> He went on to study Physics at the [[University of Edinburgh]] graduating with a [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] degree in Physics, 1st Class honours in 1966. He then commenced postgraduate study at [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], and obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree from the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1969.<ref name=whoswho>{{Who's Who | author=Anon| surname = Henderson | othernames = Dr Richard | id = U19818 | year = 2017 | doi =10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.19818 | edition = online [[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford}} {{subscription required}}</ref><ref name=hendphd>{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Cambridge|url=http://idiscover.lib.cam.ac.uk/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=44CAM_ALMA21429746340003606&context=L&vid=44CAM_PROD&search_scope=SCOP_CAM_ALL&tab=cam_lib_coll&lang=en_US|title=X-ray analysis of α-chymotrypsin : substrate and inhibitor binding|first= Richard|last=Henderson|date=1969|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.458866}}|website=lib.cam.ac.uk|oclc=500470310}}</ref>

==Career and research==
=== Research ===
Henderson worked on the structure and mechanism of [[chymotrypsin]] for his doctorate under the supervision of [[David Mervyn Blow]] at the [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology|MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology]].<ref name=fmedsci>[http://acmedsci.ac.uk/fellows/fellows-directory/ordinary-fellows/fellow/Dr-Richard-Henderson-0005681 Dr Richard Henderson FRS FMedSci Fellow Profile], [[Academy of Medical Sciences, United Kingdom|Academy of Medical Sciences]]</ref> His interest in [[membrane protein]]s led to him working on voltage-gated [[sodium channel]]s as a post-doctoral researcher at [[Yale University]]. Returning to the [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology|MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology]] in 1975, Henderson worked with [[Nigel Unwin]] to study the structure of the [[membrane protein]] [[bacteriorhodopsin]] by [[electron microscopy]].  A seminal paper in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' by Henderson and Unwin (1975)<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/257028a0 |pmid= 1161000 |bibcode= 1975Natur.257...28H |title= Three-Dimensional Model of Purple Membrane Obtained by Electron Microscopy | volume=257 | journal=Nature |pages=28–32 |year=1975 | last1 = Henderson | first1 = R.|issue= 5521 |s2cid= 4161148 }}</ref> established a low resolution structural model for bacteriorhodopsin showing the protein to consist of seven transmembrane helices.  This paper was important for a number of reasons, not the least of which was that it showed that membrane proteins had well defined structures and that transmembrane alpha-helices could occur.  After 1975 Henderson continued to work on the structure of [[bacteriorhodopsin]] without [[Nigel Unwin|Unwin]]. In 1990 Henderson published an atomic model of [[bacteriorhodopsin]] by electron crystallography in the ''[[Journal of Molecular Biology]]''.<ref>{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0022-2836(05)80271-2 |title=Model for the structure of bacteriorhodopsin based on high-resolution electron cryo-microscopy. | volume=213 | journal=Journal of Molecular Biology | pages=899–929 | pmid=2359127 | last1 = Henderson | first1 = R | last2 = Baldwin | first2 = JM | last3 = Ceska | first3 = TA | last4 = Zemlin | first4 = F | last5 = Beckmann | first5 = E | last6 = Downing | first6 = KH |issue=4 | year=1990}}</ref> This model was the second ever atomic model of a membrane protein. The techniques Henderson developed for electron crystallography are still in use.

Together with Chris Tate, Henderson helped develop conformational thermostabilisation: a method that allows any protein to be made more stable while still holding a chosen conformation of interest.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/group-leaders/t-to-z/chris-tate/|title=Chris Tate}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=October 2017}} This method has been critical in crystallising and solving the structures of several [[G protein–coupled receptor]]s (GPCRs).<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=T|last2=Serrano-Vega|first2=MJ|last3=Baker|first3=JG|last4=Moukhametzianov|first4=R|last5=Edwards|first5=PC|last6=Henderson|first6=R|last7=Leslie|first7=AG|last8=Tate|first8=CG|last9=Schertler|first9=GF|title=Structure of a beta1-adrenergic G-protein-coupled receptor.|journal=Nature|date=24 July 2008|volume=454|issue=7203|pages=486–91|doi=10.1038/nature07101|pmid=18594507|pmc=2923055|bibcode=2008Natur.454..486W}}</ref> With help from the charity [[Medical Research Council Technology|LifeArc]], Henderson and Tate founded the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|MRC]] start-up company, Heptares Therapeutics Ltd (HTL) in 2007. HTL continues to develop new drugs targeting medically important GPCRs linked to a wide range of human diseases.<ref name=fmedsci/>

In the last few years, Henderson has returned to hands-on research focusing on single particle electron microscopy. Having been an early proponent of the idea that single particle electron microscopy is capable of determining atomic resolution models for proteins, explained in a 1995 paper in Quarterly Reviews of Biophysics. Henderson aims to be able to routinely obtain atomic structures without crystals. He has made seminal contributions to many of the approaches used in single particle electron microscopy, including pioneering the development of direct electron detectors that recently allowed single particle cryo-electron microscopy to achieve its goals.<ref name=":0" />
