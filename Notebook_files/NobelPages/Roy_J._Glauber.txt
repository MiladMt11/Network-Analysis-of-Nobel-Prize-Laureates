'''Roy Jay Glauber''' (September 1, 1925 – December 26, 2018) was an American [[theoretical physicist]]. He was the [[Mallinckrodt]] [[Professor]] of [[Physics]] at [[Harvard University]] and Adjunct Professor of Optical Sciences at the [[University of Arizona]]. Born in New York City, he was awarded one half of the 2005 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] "for his contribution to the quantum theory of [[Coherence (physics)|optical coherence]]", with the other half shared by [[John L. Hall]] and [[Theodor W. Hänsch]]. In this work, published in 1963, he created a model for [[photodetection]] and explained the fundamental characteristics of different types of light, such as [[laser]] light (see [[coherent state]]) and light from light bulbs (see [[blackbody]]). His theories are widely used in the field of [[quantum optics]].<ref name="Glauber2009">{{cite journal|last1=Glauber|first1=Roy|title=An interview with Nobel laureate Roy Glauber, Physics 2005|journal=Journal of Visualized Experiments|issue=28|pages=1535|year=2009|issn=1940-087X|doi=10.3791/1535|pmid=19561567|pmc=3149897}}</ref><ref>R.

He served on the National Advisory Board<ref>{{cite web|title=Board|url=http://armscontrolcenter.org/about/board/#RGlauber|website=Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation|publisher=Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferatio|access-date=22 September 2016}}</ref> of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation, the research arms of [[Council for a Livable World]].

==Education==
Glauber was born in 1925 in New York City, the son of Felicia (Fox) and Emanuel B. Glauber.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CZNNAQAAIAAJ&q=%22Emanuel+B.+and+Felicia+(Fox)+G.%22|title=World Who's who in Science: A Biographical Dictionary of Notable Scientists from Antiquity to the Present|first=Allen G.|last=Debus|date=6 January 1968|publisher=Marquis-Who's Who|via=Google Books}}</ref> He was a member of the 1941 graduating class of the [[Bronx High School of Science]], the first graduating class from that school.  He then went on to do his undergraduate work at [[Harvard University]]. After his sophomore year he was recruited to work on the [[Manhattan Project]], where (at the age of 18) he was one of the youngest scientists at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]]. His work involved calculating the [[critical mass]] for the [[atom bomb]]. After two years at Los Alamos, he returned to Harvard, receiving his bachelor's degree in 1946 and his PhD in 1949.<ref name=phd>{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Roy Jay|last=Glauber |title=The relativistic theory of meson fields |publisher=[[Harvard University]] |date=1949 |bibcode=1949PhDT.........7G |oclc=76985581}}</ref>

==Research==
Glauber's recent research dealt with problems in a number of areas of quantum optics, a field which, broadly speaking, studies the [[quantum electrodynamic]]al interactions of light and matter. He also continued work on several topics in high-energy collision theory, including the analysis of [[hadron]] collisions, and the statistical correlation of particles produced in high-energy reactions.

Specific topics of his research included: the quantum mechanical behavior of trapped [[wave packet]]s; interactions of light with trapped ions; atom counting-the statistical properties of free atom beams and their measurement; algebraic methods for dealing with [[fermion]] statistics; coherence and correlations of [[bosonic atom]]s near the [[Bose–Einstein condensation]]; the theory of continuously monitored photon counting-and its reaction on quantum sources; the fundamental nature of "[[Atomic electron transition|quantum jumps]]"; resonant transport of particles produced multiply in high-energy collisions; the multiple diffraction model of proton-proton and proton-antiproton scattering.

==Awards and honors==
Glauber received many honors for his research, including the [[Albert A. Michelson Medal]] from the [[Franklin Institute]] in [[Philadelphia]] (1985),<ref name="MichelsonMedal_Laureates">{{cite web |url=http://www.fi.edu/winners/show_results.faw?gs=&ln=&fn=&keyword=&subject=&award=MICH+&sy=1967&ey=1997&name=Submit |title=Franklin Laureate Database - Albert A.

===Ig Nobel===
For many years before winning his Nobel Prize, Glauber was familiar to audiences of the [[Ig Nobel Prize]] ceremonies, where he took a bow each year as "Keeper of the Broom," sweeping the stage clean of the [[paper airplane]]s that have traditionally been thrown during the event.  He missed the 2005 event, though, as he was being awarded his real Nobel Prize for Physics.

==Personal life==
Glauber lived in [[Arlington, Massachusetts]].

Glauber was a guest scientist at the [[CERN|European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)]] in 1967, during a sabbatical.<ref name="nobelBio">{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2005/glauber/biographical/|title=Roy J. Glauber - Biographical|publisher=The Nobel Prize|first=Roy J.|last=Glauber|access-date=2019-07-12}}</ref>

Glauber had a son and a daughter, and five grandchildren. He died on December 26, 2018 in [[Newton, Massachusetts]].  His remains were laid to rest in [[Kensico Cemetery]], Valhalla, NY.<ref>{{cite news |first=Dylan |last=McClain |title=Roy J.

==Controversy regarding Nobel Prize==
There is controversy regarding the 2005 Nobel Prize that was awarded to Glauber but not to [[George Sudarshan]] whose ideas were rebranded by Glauber as P-representation. Glauber had criticized Sudarshan's use of classical electromagnetic theory in explaining optical fields, which surprised Sudarshan because he believed the theory provided accurate explanations. Sudarshan subsequently wrote a paper expressing his ideas and sent a preprint to Glauber. Glauber informed Sudarshan of similar results and asked to be acknowledged in the latter's paper, while criticizing Sudarshan in his own paper.<ref name="Physicist Sudarshan's omission questioned">{{cite news |url=http://www.thehindu.com/2005/12/02/stories/2005120206181100.htm |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |title=Physicist Sudarshan's omission questioned |date=2 December 2005 }}{{dead link|date=April 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> "Glauber criticized Sudarshan’s representation, but his own was unable to generate any of the typical quantum optics phenomena, hence he introduces what he calls a P-representation, which was Sudarshan’s representation by another name", wrote a physicist. "This representation, which had at first been scorned by Glauber, later becomes known as the [[Glauber–Sudarshan P representation|Glauber–Sudarshan representation]]."<ref name="ECG Sudarshan, physicist who proposed faster than light theory, dies at 86">{{Cite web |url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/science/ecg-sudarshan-physicist-who-proposed-faster-than-light-theory-dies-at-86/story-STfgrT2o5xC2tC7olCFS0I.html |title=ECG Sudarshan, physicist who proposed faster than light theory, dies at 86 |date=14 May 2018 |website=www.hindustantimes.com |language=en |access-date=20 December 2018}}</ref>

Sudarshan was passed over for the Physics Nobel Prize on more than one occasion, leading to [[Nobel Prize controversies#Physics|controversy]] in 2005 when several physicists wrote to the Swedish Academy, protesting that Sudarshan should have been awarded a share of the Prize for the Sudarshan diagonal representation (also known as Glauber–Sudarshan representation) in quantum optics, for which Glauber won his share of the prize.<ref>{{cite web | last = Zhou | first = Lulu | title = Scientists Question Nobel | work = The Harvard Crimson | date = 6 December 2005 | url = http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=510342 | access-date = 22 February 2008}}</ref> Sudarshan and other physicists sent a letter to the Nobel Committee claiming that the P representation had more contributions of "Sudarshan" than "Glauber".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Epstein |first1=David |title=Nobel Doubts |url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2005/12/07/nobel-doubts |access-date=26 February 2021 |work=[[Inside Higher Ed]] |date=December 7, 2005 |language=en}}</ref> The letter goes on to say that Glauber criticized Sudarshan's theory—before renaming it the "P representation" and incorporating it into his own work. In an unpublished letter to ''The New York Times'', Sudarshan calls the "Glauber–Sudarshan representation" a misnomer, adding that "literally all subsequent theoretic developments in the field of Quantum Optics make use of" Sudarshan's work— essentially, asserting that he had developed the breakthrough.<ref name="UT Austin Mourns Passing of George Sudarshan, Titan of 20th Century Physics"> {{Cite web |url=https://cns.utexas.edu/news/ut-austin-mourns-passing-of-george-sudarshan-titan-of-20th-century-physics |title=UT Austin Mourns Passing of George Sudarshan, Titan of 20th Century Physics |date=20 December 2018 |website=cns.utexas.edu |language=en-gb |access-date=20 December 2018}}</ref><ref name="First Runner-up">{{Cite web |url=http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/first_runner-up/ |title=First Runner-up |date=20 December 2018 |website=seedmagazine.com |access-date=20 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304121806/http://seedmagazine.com/content/article/first_runner-up/ |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=unfit }}</ref> In 2007, Sudarshan told the ''[[Hindustan Times]]'', "The 2005 Nobel prize for Physics was awarded for my work, but I wasn't the one to get it.
