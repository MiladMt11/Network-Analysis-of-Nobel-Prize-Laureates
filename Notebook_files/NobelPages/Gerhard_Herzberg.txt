He is well known for using these techniques that determine the structures of [[diatomic]] and [[polyatomic]] molecules, including [[free radicals]] which are difficult to investigate in any other way, and for the chemical analysis of astronomical objects.  Herzberg served as Chancellor of [[Carleton University]] in [[Ottawa|Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada from 1973 to 1980.

==Early life and family==
[[File:DrGerhardHerzberg.jpg|thumb|Commemorative plaque at [[College Building (Saskatchewan)|College Building]], [[University of Saskatchewan]]]]
Herzberg was born in [[Hamburg]], Germany on December 25, 1904 to Albin H. Herzberg and Ella Biber.<ref name=science>{{cite web|title=Gerhard Herzberg: The Person|url=http://www.science.ca/scientists/scientistprofile.php?pID=8&pg=3|publisher=GCS Research Society|access-date=2011-01-01}}</ref> He had an older brother, Walter, who was born in January 1904.<ref name=herzbook>{{harvnb|Stoicheff|2002}}</ref>  Herzberg started [[Vorschule]] (pre-school) late, after contracting measles.<ref>{{harvnb|Stoicheff|2002|p=7}}</ref> Gerhard and his family were atheists and kept this fact hidden.<ref name=herzbook/> His father died in 1914, at 43 years of age, after having suffered from [[dropsy]] and complications due to an earlier heart condition.  Herzberg graduated Vorschule shortly after his father's death.<ref>{{harvnb|Stoicheff|2002|p=8}}</ref> His wife died in 1971.

==Education and career==
Initially, Herzberg considered a career in [[astronomy]], but his application to the [[Hamburg Observatory]] was returned advising him not to pursue a career in the field without private financial support.<ref name=nsercbio />  After completing high school at the [[Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums]], Herzberg continued his education at [[Darmstadt University of Technology]] with the help of a private scholarship.<ref name=nsercbio /><ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/aug25/articles38.htm | title =Gerhard Herzberg – An obituary | last =Naransinham | first =N.A. and Ahmad, S.A. | date =1999 | publisher =Indian Institute of Science | access-date =2016-02-21 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url =http://www.johanneum-hamburg.de/index.php/schola-nostra/schule-mit-geschichte/beruehmte-alumni/59-gerhard-herzberg | title =Gerhard Herzberg | website =Schola nostra | publisher =Gelehrtenschule des Johanneums | access-date =2016-02-21 }}</ref>  Herzberg completed his Dr.-Ing. degree under [[Hans Rau]] in 1928.<ref name=nsercbio>{{cite web|title=GERHARD HERZBERG |url=http://www.science.ca/scientists/scientistprofile.php?pID=8&pg=3|publisher=GCS Research Society|access-date=2015-02-07}}</ref>

==Honours and awards==
Herzberg's most significant award was the 1971 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]], which he was awarded "for his contributions to the knowledge of electronic structure and geometry of molecules, particularly free radicals".<ref name=nobelcite />  During the presentation speech, it was noted that at the time of the award, Herzberg was "generally considered to be the world's foremost  molecular spectroscopist."<ref name=nobelpresentation>{{cite web|title=Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1971 Award Ceremony Speech|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1971/press.html|publisher=Nobel Media|access-date=2010-12-31}}</ref>

Herzberg was honoured with memberships or fellowships by a very large number of scientific societies, received many awards and honorary degrees in different countries.  The [[NSERC]] [[Gerhard Herzberg Canada Gold Medal for Science and Engineering]], Canada's highest research award, was named in his honour in 2000.  The [[Canadian Association of Physicists]] also has an annual award named in his honour. The [[Herzberg Institute of Astrophysics]] is named for him. He was made a member of the [[International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science]]. Asteroid [[3316 Herzberg]] is named after him.  In 1964 he was awarded the  [http://www.osa.org/aboutosa/awards/osaawards/awardsdesc/ivesquinn/ Frederic Ives Medal] by the [[Optical Society of America|OSA]]. At Carleton University, there is a building named after him that belongs to the Physics and Mathematics/Statistics Departments, Herzberg Laboratories. Herzberg was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1951|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1951]].<ref name="frs"/>

The main building of [[John Abbott College]] in [[Montreal]] is named after him. Carleton University named the Herzberg Laboratories building after him. A public park in the [[College Park, Saskatoon|College Park]] neighbourhood of [[Saskatoon]] also bears his name.

==Books and publications==
Herzberg authored some classic works in the field of spectroscopy, including ''Atomic Spectra and Atomic Structure'' and the encyclopaedic four volume work: ''Molecular Spectra and Molecular Structure'', which is often called the spectroscopist's bible.<ref name=herzbook/>  The three volumes of Molecular Spectra and Molecular Structure were re-issued by Krieger in 1989, including extensive new footnotes by Herzberg. Volume IV of the series, "Constants of diatomic molecules" is purely a reference work, a compendium of known spectroscopic constants (and therefore a bibliography of molecular spectroscopy) of diatomic molecules up until 1978.
