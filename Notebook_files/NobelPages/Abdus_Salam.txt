==Biography==

===Youth and education===
Abdus Salam was born to Chaudhry Muhammad Hussain and Hajira Hussain, into a [[Punjabi Muslims|Punjabi Muslim]] family that was part of the [[Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam]]. His grandfather, Gul Muhammad, was a religious scholar as well as a physician,<ref name="kibble98"/> while his father was an education officer in the Department of Education of [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab State]] in a poor farming district.
[[File:St John's College Second Court, Cambridge, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|[[St John's College, Cambridge]] is where Salam studied.]]
Salam very early established a reputation throughout Punjab and later at the University of Cambridge for outstanding brilliance and academic achievement. At age 14, Salam scored the highest marks ever recorded for the matriculation (entrance) examination at the [[University of the Punjab|Punjab University]].<ref>{{harv|Fraser|2008|pp=59–78}}</ref> He won a full scholarship to the [[Government College, Lahore|Government College University]] of [[Lahore]], [[Punjab (British India)|Punjab State]], [[British India]].<ref>{{harv|Fraser|2008|pp=78–80}}</ref> Salam was a versatile scholar, interested in [[Urdu literature|Urdu]] and [[British literature|English literature]] in which he excelled. After a month in Lahore, he went to [[Bombay]] to Study. In 1947, he came back to Lahore.<ref>{{harv|Murthi|1999|pp=42}}</ref> But he soon picked up Mathematics as his concentration.<ref>{{harv|Murthi|1999|pp=43}}</ref> Salam's mentor and tutors wanted him to become an English teacher, but Salam decided to stick with Mathematics<ref name=" Munir Ahmad Khan, Former Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, former Head of the Nuclear Engineering Division, and former Head of the Reactor Engineering IAEA Division ">{{cite journal| last =Khan| first =Munir Ahmad| author-link =Munir Ahmad Khan| title =The Abdus Salam Memorial Meeting: A Tribute to Abdus Salam; a lifelong friendship with Abdus Salam| journal =ICTP and UNESCO World Heritage Site| volume =1| issue =1| pages =103–159| date =22 November 1997| publisher = Munir Ahmad Khan, Former Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, former Head of the Nuclear Engineering Division, and former Head of the Reactor Engineering IAEA Division|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0011/001190/119078Eb.pdf}}</ref> As a fourth-year student there, he published his work on [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]]'s problems in mathematics, and took his B.A. in Mathematics in 1944.<ref>Abdus Salam, A Problem of Ramanujam, Publ. in Math.

During his doctoral studies, his mentors challenged him to solve within one year an intractable problem which had defied such great minds as [[Paul Dirac]] and [[Richard Feynman]].<ref name=" Munir Ahmad Khan, Former Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, former Head of the Nuclear Engineering Division, and former Head of the Reactor Engineering IAEA Division "/> Within six months, Salam had found a solution for the [[renormalization]] of meson theory.

Robert Oppenheimer]] and Dirac.<ref name=" Munir Ahmad Khan, Former Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, former Head of the Nuclear Engineering Division, and former Head of the Reactor Engineering IAEA Division "/>

===Academic career===

After receiving his doctorate in 1951, Salam returned to Lahore at the [[Government College University, Lahore|Government College University]] as a Professor of Mathematics where he remained till 1954. In 1952, he was appointed professor and Chair of the Department of Mathematics at the neighbouring University of the Punjab. In the latter capacity, Salam sought to update the university curriculum, introducing a course in [[Quantum mechanics]] as a part of the undergraduate curriculum.<ref>{{harv|Fayyazuddin|2005|pp=5}}</ref> However, this initiative was soon reverted by the Vice-Chancellor, and Salam decided to teach an evening course in Quantum Mechanics outside the regular curriculum.<ref>{{harv|Fayyazuddin|2005|pp=5–6}}</ref> While Salam enjoyed a mixed popularity in the university, he began to supervise the education of students who were particularly influenced by him.<ref>{{harv|Fayyazuddin|2005|pp=7–8}}</ref> As a result, Riazuddin remained the only student of Salam who had the privilege to study under Salam at the undergraduate and post-graduate level in Lahore, and [[Postdoctoral research|post-doctoral]] level in Cambridge University. In 1953, Salam was unable to establish a research institute in Lahore, as he faced strong opposition from his peers.<ref>{{harv|Fraser|2008|pp=237–238}}</ref> In 1954, Salam took fellowship and became one of the earliest [[Fellow of the Pakistan Academy of Sciences|fellows of the Pakistan Academy of Sciences]]. As a result of [[1953 Lahore riots]], Salam went back to Cambridge and joined [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's College]], and took a position as a professor of mathematics in 1954.<ref>{{harv|Duff|2007|pp=39–41}}</ref> In 1957, he was invited to take a chair at [[Imperial College, London]], and he and [[Paul Taunton Matthews|Paul Matthews]] went on to set up the Theoretical Physics Department at Imperial College.<ref>{{harv|Duff|2007|pp=ix}}</ref> As time passed, this department became one of the prestigious research departments that included well known physicists such as [[Steven Weinberg]], [[Tom W. B. Kibble|Tom Kibble]], [[Gerald Guralnik]], [[C. R. Hagen]], [[Riazuddin (physicist)|Riazuddin]], and [[John Clive Ward|John Ward]].

In 1957, Punjab University conferred Salam with an [[Honorary degree|Honorary doctorate]] for his contribution in Particle physics.<ref>{{harv|Duff|2007|pp=37}}</ref> The same year with help from his mentor, Salam launched a scholarship programme for his students in Pakistan. Salam retained strong links with Pakistan, and visited his country from time to time.<ref>{{harv|Duff|2007|pp=iix}}</ref> At Cambridge and Imperial College he formed a group of theoretical physicists, the majority of whom were his Pakistani students. At age 33, Salam became one of the youngest persons to be elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1959|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1959]].<ref name="kibble98" /> Salam took a fellowship at the [[Princeton University]] in 1959, where he met with [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]<ref>{{harv|Fraser|2008|pp=239–240}}</ref> and to whom he presented his research work on neutrinos.<ref>{{harv|Fraser|2008|pp=241–242}}</ref> Oppenheimer and Salam discussed the foundation of electrodynamics, problems and their solution.<ref>{{harv|Fraser|2008|pp=250}}</ref> His dedicated personal assistant was Jean Bouckley. In 1980, Salam became a foreign fellow of the [[Bangladesh Academy of Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web| title =Professor Abdus Salam FRS (Deceased)|url=http://www.bas.org.bd/fellowship/list-of-fellows-/userprofile/asalam.html| date =1980|access-date =23 August 2016 }}</ref>

===Scientific career===
Early in his career, Salam made an important and significant contribution in [[quantum electrodynamics]] and [[quantum field theory]], including its extension into [[Particle physics|particle]] and [[nuclear physics]]. In his early career in Pakistan, Salam was greatly interested in mathematical series and their relation to physics. Salam had played an influential role in the advancement of nuclear physics, but he maintained and dedicated himself to mathematics and theoretical physics and focused Pakistan to do more research in theoretical physics.<ref name="Munir Ahmad Khan, Former Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, former Head of the Nuclear Engineering Division, and former Head of the Reactor Engineering IAEA Division"/> However, he regarded nuclear physics (nuclear fission and nuclear power) as a non-pioneering part of physics as it had already "happened".<ref name="Munir Ahmad Khan, Former Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, former Head of the Nuclear Engineering Division, and former Head of the Reactor Engineering IAEA Division "/> Even in Pakistan, Salam was the leading driving force in theoretical physics in Pakistan, with many scientists he continued to influence and encourage to keep their work on theoretical physics.<ref name="Munir Ahmad Khan, Former Chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission, former Head of the Nuclear Engineering Division, and former Head of the Reactor Engineering IAEA Division "/>

Salam had a prolific research career in theoretical and high-energy physics.<ref name="Riazuddin 2005 31">{{harv|Riazuddin|2005|pp=31}}</ref> Salam had worked on theory of the [[neutrino]] – an elusive particle that was first postulated by [[Wolfgang Pauli]] in the 1930s. Salam introduced [[chiral symmetry]] in the theory of neutrinos. The introduction of chiral symmetry played crucial role in subsequent development of the [[Electroweak interaction|theory of electroweak interactions]].<ref>{{harv|Riazuddin|2005|pp=31–33}}</ref> Salam later passed his work to [[Riazuddin (physicist)|Riazuddin]], who made pioneering contributions in neutrinos. Salam introduced the massive [[Higgs boson]]s to the theory of the [[Standard Model]], where he later predicted the existence of [[proton decay]]. In 1963, Salam published his theoretical work on the [[vector meson]].

[[File:Abdus Salam lecture.jpg|thumb|Abdus Salam lectures on G.U.T. at the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Oriental Institute of Chicago|Oriental Institute]]]]In 1966, Salam carried out pioneering work on a [[hypothetical particle]]. Salam showed the possible [[electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] interaction between the [[Magnetic monopole]] and the [[CP-violation|C-violation]], thus he formulated the [[magnetic photon]].<ref name="A.

Following the publication of [[1964 PRL symmetry breaking papers|PRL Symmetry Breaking]] papers in 1964, Steven Weinberg and Salam were the first to apply the Higgs mechanism to [[electroweak symmetry breaking]]. Salam provided a mathematical postulation for the interaction between the Higgs boson and the electroweak symmetry theory.<ref>{{harv|Ali|Isham|Kibble|Riazuddin|1994|pp=156–158}}</ref>

In 1972, Salam began to work with [[Indian-American]] theoretical physicist [[Jogesh Pati]]. Pati wrote to Salam several times expressing interest to work under Salam's direction, in response to which Salam eventually invited Pati to the ICTP seminar in Pakistan. Salam suggested to Pati that there should be some deep reason why the protons and electrons are so different and yet carry equal but opposite electric charge. Protons carry quarks, but the electroweak theory was concerned only with the electrons and neutrinos, with nothing postulated about quarks. If all of nature's ingredients could be brought together in one new symmetry, it might reveal a reason for the various features of these particles and the forces they feel. This led to the development of [[Pati–Salam model]] in particle physics.<ref>{{harv|Fraser|2008|pp=205}}</ref> In 1973, Salam and Jogesh Pati were the first to notice that since [[Quark]]s and [[Lepton]]s have very similar [[Special unitary group|SU(2)]] × [[Circle group|U(1)]] representation content, they all may have similar entities.<ref>{{harv|Ali|Isham|Kibble|Riazuddin|1994|pp=321–322}}</ref> They provided a simple realisation of the quark-lepton symmetry by postulating that [[lepton number]] was a fourth [[Color charge|colour]], dubbed "violet".<ref>{{harv|Ali|Isham|Kibble|Riazuddin|1994|pp=322}}</ref>

Physicists had believed that there were four fundamental forces of nature: the gravitational force, the strong and weak nuclear forces, and the electromagnetic force. Salam had worked on the unification of these forces from 1959 with Glashow and Weinberg. While at Imperial College London, Salam successfully showed that weak nuclear forces are not really different from electromagnetic forces, and two could inter-convert. Salam provided a theory that shows the unification of two fundamental forces of nature, weak nuclear forces and the electromagnetic forces, one into another.<ref name="Riazuddin 2005 31"/> Glashow had also formulated the same work, and the theory was combined in 1966. In 1967, Salam proved the electroweak unification theory mathematically, and finally published the papers. For this achievement, Salam, Glashow, and Weinberg were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1979. The Nobel Prize Foundation paid tribute to the scientists and issued a statement saying: "For their contributions to the theory of the unified weak and electromagnetic interaction between elementary particles, including, inter alia, the prediction of the weak neutral current".<ref name="Nobel Prize"/> Salam took the Nobel Prize medal to the house of his former professor, Anilendra Ganguly, who taught him at the [[Sanatan Dharma College]] in Lahore, and placed the medal around his neck, stating "Mr Anilendra Ganguly this medal is a result of your teaching and love of mathematics that you instilled in me".<ref name="Wangchuk2019"/> In the 1970s Salam continued trying to unify forces by including the strong interaction in a [[grand unified theory]].

==Government work==

Abdus Salam returned to Pakistan in 1960 to take charge of a government post given to him by President [[Ayub Khan (general)|Ayub Khan]]. From her independence in 1947 after the [[Partition of India]], Pakistan has never had a [[Science in Pakistan|coherent science policy]], and total expenditure on research and development was only ~1.0% of Pakistan's GDP.<ref>{{harv|Ghani|1982|pp=64–83}}</ref> Even the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]] headquarters was located in a small room, and less than 10 scientists were working on fundamental physics concepts.<ref>{{harv|Ghani|1982|pp=67–70}}</ref> Salam replaced [[Salimuzzaman Siddiqui]] as the [[Ministry of Science and Technology (Pakistan)#Science Advisors|Science Advisor]], and became first [[Chief technical officer|Member (technical)]] of PAEC.

[[File:International Centre for Theoretical Physics.jpg|left|thumb|The [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics|Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics]] was founded by Salam in 1964.]]
From the 1950s, Salam had tried establishing high-powered research institutes in Pakistan, though he was unable to do so. He moved PAEC Headquarters to a bigger building, and established research laboratories all over the country.<ref>{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=05–19}}</ref> On the direction of Salam, [[Ishrat Hussain Usmani]] set up plutonium and uranium exploration committees throughout the country. In October 1961, Salam travelled to the United States and signed a space co-operation agreement between Pakistan and US. In November 1961, the US [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) started to build a space facility – [[Sonmiani (space facility)|Flight Test Center]] (FTC) – at [[Sonmiani]], a coastal town in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan Province]]. Salam served as its first technical director.

Salam played an influential and significant role in Pakistan's development of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. In 1964, he was made head of Pakistan's [[IAEA]] delegation and represented Pakistan for a decade.<ref>{{harv|Duff|2007|pp=18–19}}</ref> The same year, Salam joined [[Munir Ahmad Khan]] – his lifelong friend and contemporary at Government College University. Khan was the first person in the IAEA that Salam had consulted about the establishment of the [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]] (ICTP), a research physics institution, in [[Trieste]], Italy. With an agreement signed with IAEA, the ICTP was set up with Salam as its first director. At IAEA, Salam had advocated the importance of nuclear power plants in his country.<ref>{{harv|Duff|2007|pp=19–20}}</ref> It was due to his effort that in 1965, Canada and Pakistan signed a nuclear energy co-operation deal. Salam obtained permission from President Ayub Khan – against the wishes of his own government functionaries – to set up the [[Karachi Nuclear Power Plant]].<ref>{{harv|Riazuddin|2005|pp=33–34}}</ref> Also in 1965, led by Salam, the United States and Pakistan signed an agreement in which the US provided Pakistan with a [[Pakistan Atomic Research Reactor#PARR-I Reactor|small research reactor]] (PARR-I). Salam had a long-held dream to establish a research institute in Pakistan, which he had advocated for on many occasions. In 1965 again, Salam and architect [[Edward Durell Stone]] signed a contract for the establishment of the [[Pakistan Institute of Nuclear Science and Technology]] (PINSTECH) at [[Nilore]], Islamabad.<ref>{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=30–31}}</ref>

===Space programme===

In early 1961, Salam approached President Khan to lay the foundations of Pakistan's first executive agency to co-ordinate space research.<ref name="Suparco"/> By executive order on 16 September 1961 the [[Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission]] (SUPARCO) was established with Salam founding director.<ref name="Suparco"/> Salam immediately travelled to the United States, where he signed a space co-operation agreement with the US Government. In November 1961, NASA built the Flight Test Center in Balochistan Province. During this time, Salam visited the [[Pakistan Air Force Academy]] where he met with [[Air Commodore]] ([[Brigadier-General]]) [[Wladyslaw Turowicz]] – a Polish military scientist and an [[aerospace engineer]].<ref>{{harv|Duff|2007|pp=50–60}}</ref> Turowicz was made the first technical director of the space centre, and a programme of rocket testing ensued.

In 1965, Salam led the establishing of the nuclear research institute—[[PINSTECH]].<ref>{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=09–10}}</ref> In 1965, the plutonium [[Pakistan Atomic Research Reactor]] (PARR-I) went [[Critical mass|critical]] under Salams' leadership.<ref name="Rahman 1998 15–19"/> In 1973, Salam proposed the idea of establishing an annual college to promote scientific activities in the country to the Chairman of PAEC, Munir Khan, who accepted and fully supported the idea. This led to the establishment of the [[International Nathiagali Summer College on Physics and Contemporary Needs]] (INSC), where each year since 1976 scientists from all over the world come to Pakistan to interact with local scientists. The first annual INSC conference was held on advanced particle and nuclear physics.

In November 1971, Salam met with [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] in his residence, and following Bhutto's advice, went to the United States to avoid the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]].<ref>{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=25–40}}</ref> Salam travelled to the US and returned to Pakistan with scientific literature about the [[Manhattan Project]],<ref>{{harv|Rahman|1998|pp=38–40}}</ref> and calculations involving atomic bombs.<ref name="Norman Dombey, Physics and Astronomy Department of the University of Sussex"/> In 1972, the Government of Pakistan learned about the development status of the first atomic bomb completed under the [[Indian nuclear programme]].  On 20 January 1972, Salam, as Science Advisor to the [[President of Pakistan]], managed and participated in a secret meeting of nuclear scientists with former Prime Minister, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, in Multan, known as the 'Multan Meeting'.

He once wrote that "the Holy Quran enjoins us to reflect on the verities of Allah's created laws of nature; however, that our generation has been privileged to glimpse a part of His design is a bounty and a grace for which I render thanks with a humble heart."''<ref name="NobelBio" />

During his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize in Physics, Salam quoted verses from the [[Quran]] and stated:
{{quote|"Thou seest not, in the creation of the All-merciful any imperfection, Return thy gaze, seest thou any fissure? Then Return thy gaze, again and again. Thy gaze, Comes back to thee dazzled, aweary." ([[Q67:3–4|67:3–4]])

This, in effect, is the faith of all physicists; the deeper we seek, the more is our wonder excited, the more is the dazzlement for our gaze.<ref name="The Nobel Prize in Physics 1979 - Banquet Speech">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1979/salam-speech.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1979 – Banquet Speech |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=10 December 1979 |access-date=9 December 2012}}</ref>}}

In 1974, the Pakistan parliament made the [[Second Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan]] that declared Ahmadi to be {{linktext|non-Muslim}}. In protest, Salam left Pakistan for London. After his departure, he did not completely cut his ties to Pakistan, and kept a close association with the Theoretical Physics Group as well as academic scientists from the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission.<ref name="Riazuddin 2005 34"/>

===Death===
[[File:Grave of Abdus Salam.jpg|thumb|right|The grave of Abdus Salam at [[Rabwah]], Pakistan with the word 'Muslim' obscured.]]

Salam's work in Pakistan has been far reaching and regarded as highly influential. He is remembered by his peers and students as the "father of Pakistan's school of Theoretical Physics" as well as Pakistan's science.

Salam has been commemorated by noted and prominent Pakistani scientists, who were also his students. Many scientists have recalled their college experiences. [[Ghulam Murtaza (physicist)|Ghulam Murtaza]], a professor of [[plasma physics]] at the Government College University and student of Salam, wrote:

[[File:Dr. Abdus Salam Scientists of Pakistan.jpg|thumb|upright|A commemorative stamp honouring Abdus Salam]]

<blockquote>When Dr. Salam was to deliver a lecture, the hall would be packed and although the subject was [[Particle Physics]], his manner and eloquence was such as if he was talking about literature. When he finished his lectures, listeners would often burst into spontaneous applause and give him a standing ovation. People from all parts of the world would come to [[Imperial College]] and seek Dr. Salam's help. He would give a patient hearing to everyone including those who were talking nonsense. He treated everyone with respect and compassion and never belittled or offended anyone. Dr. Salam's strength was that he could "sift jewels from the sand".<ref name="chowkbio">Zainab Mahmood (26 November 2004){{cite web|url=http://www.chowk.com/articles/8387 |title=Dr Abdus Salam – The 'Mystic' scientist|access-date=2009-05-19|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216051624/http://www.chowk.com/articles/8387|archive-date=16 February 2008|df=dmy}}.Chowk: Science</ref></blockquote>

[[Ishfaq Ahmad]], a lifelong friend of Salam recalls:

<blockquote>Dr Salam was responsible for sending about 500 physicists, mathematicians and scientists from Pakistan, for PhD's to the best institutions in UK and USA.<ref name="chowkbio"/></blockquote>

In August 1996 another lifelong friend, [[Munir Ahmad Khan]], met Salam in Oxford. Khan, who headed the [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons]] and [[Nuclear power in Pakistan|nuclear energy programmes]], said:

<blockquote>My last meeting with Abdus Salam was only three months ago. His disease had taken its toll and he was unable to talk. Yet he understood what was said. I told him about the celebration held in Pakistan on his seventieth birthday. He kept staring at me. He had risen above praise. As I rose to leave he pressed my hand to express his feelings as if he wanted to thank everyone who had said kind words about him. Dr. Abdus Salam had deep love for Pakistan in spite of the fact that he was treated unfairly and indifferently by his own country. It became more and more difficult for him to come to Pakistan and this hurt him deeply. Now he has returned home finally, to rest in peace for ever in the soil that he loved so much. May be in the years to come we will rise above our prejudice and own him and give him, after his death, what we could not when he was alive. We Pakistanis may choose to ignore Dr. Salam, but the world at large will always remember him.<ref name="chowkbio"/> </blockquote>

Salam's primary focus was research on the physics of elementary particles. His particular numerous groundbreaking contributions included:

* two-component [[neutrino]] theory and the prediction of the inevitable parity violation in [[weak interaction]];
* gauge [[Unified field theory|unification]] of weak and electromagnetic interactions, the unified force is called the "[[Electroweak interaction|Electroweak]]" force, a name given to it by Salam, and which forms the basis of the [[Standard Model]] in particle physics;
* predicted the existence of weak [[neutral currents]], and [[W and Z bosons]], before their experimental discovery (independently predictd by [[Sheldon Lee Glashow]]);<ref>{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1979|url=http://www.nobel.se/physics/laureates/1979|publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|access-date=10 September 2008}}</ref>
* symmetry properties of elementary particles; [[unitary symmetry]];
* renormalisation of meson theories;
* gravity theory and its role in particle physics; two tensor theory of gravity and strong interaction physics;
* unification of electroweak with strong nuclear forces, [[grand unification theory]];
* related prediction of proton-decay;
* [[Pati–Salam model]], a grand unification theory;
