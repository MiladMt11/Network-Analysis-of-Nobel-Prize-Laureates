'''Michael Stanley Whittingham''' (born 22 December 1941) is a [[United Kingdom|British]]-[[United States|American]] [[chemist]]. He is currently a [[professor]] of chemistry and director of both the Institute for Materials Research and the [[Materials Science]] and Engineering program at [[Binghamton University]], [[State University of New York]]. He also serves as director of the Northeastern Center for Chemical Energy Storage (NECCES) of the [[U.S. Department of Energy]] at Binghamton. He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 2019 alongside [[Akira Yoshino]] and [[John B. Goodenough]].<ref name="Nobel-2019msw" /><ref name="NYT-20191009" />

Whittingham is a key figure in the history of the development of [[lithium-ion batteries]], which now are used in everything from mobile phones to electric vehicles. He discovered the [[intercalation (chemistry)|intercalation]] electrodes in the 1970s for the first time and thoroughly described the concept of intercalation reaction for rechargeable batteries in the late of 1970s. He holds the original patents on the concept of the use of intercalation chemistry in high power-density, highly reversible lithium-ion batteries. And he invented the first rechargeable lithium-ion battery, patented in 1977, and assigned to Exxon. His work on lithium-ion batteries laid the foundations for others' later developments. Therefore, he is called the Founding Father of lithium-ion batteries.<ref name="Ramanan">{{cite journal| first=A. |last=Ramanan |title=Development of lithium-ion batteries – 2019 Nobel Prize for Chemistry |journal=Current Science | volume=117 |issue=9 |pages=1416-1418 |date=10 November 2019| access-date=16 March 2021 |url-status=unfit |url=https://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/117/09/1416.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191205170914/https://www.currentscience.ac.in/Volumes/117/09/1416.pdf |archive-date=5 December 2019}}</ref>

== Research ==
Whittingham is a key figure in the history of the development of [[lithium-ion batteries]], discovering the concept of [[intercalation (chemistry)|intercalation]] electrodes. Exxon manufactured Whittingham's lithium-ion battery in the 1970s, which was based on a titanium disulfide cathode and a lithium-aluminum anode.<ref name="rfsuny" /> The battery had high energy density and the diffusion of lithium ions into the titanium disulphide cathode was reversible, making the battery rechargeable. In addition, titanium disulphide has a particularly fast rate of lithium ion diffusion into the crystal lattice. Exxon threw its resources behind the commercialization of a Li/LiClO{{Sub|4}}/ TiS{{Sub|2}} battery. Safety concerns led Exxon to end the project. Whittingham and his team continued to publish their work in academic journals of electrochemistry and solid-state physics. He eventually left Exxon in 1984 and spent four years at Schlumberger as a Manager. In 1988, he accepted the position of Professor at the Chemistry Department, Binghamton University, U.S. to pursue his academic interests.

"All these batteries are called intercalation batteries. It’s like putting jam in a sandwich. In the chemical terms, it means you have a crystal structure, and we can put lithium ions in, take them out, and the structure’s exactly the same afterwards," Whittingham said "We retain the crystal structure. That’s what makes these lithium batteries so good, allows them to cycle for so long."<ref name="rfsuny">{{cite web |title=Binghamton professor recognized for energy research |url=https://www.rfsuny.org/rf-news/binghamton-energy/binghamton---energy.html |website=The Research Foundation for the State University of New York |access-date=10 October 2019}}</ref>

Today's lithium batteries are limited in capacity because less than one lithium-ion/electron is reversibly intercalated per transition metal redox center. To achieve higher energy densities, one approach is to go beyond the one electron redox intercalation reactions of the above systems. Currently, Whittingham's research has advanced to multi-electron intercalation reactions, which can increase the storage capacity by intercalating multiple lithium ions. A few multi-electron intercalation materials have been successfully developed by Whittingham, like LiVOPO<sub>4</sub>/VOPO<sub>4</sub>, etc. The multivalent [[vanadium]] cation (V<sup>3+</sup><->V<sup>5+</sup>) plays an important role to accomplish the multi-electron reactions. These promising materials shine lights on the battery industry to increase energy density rapidly.
