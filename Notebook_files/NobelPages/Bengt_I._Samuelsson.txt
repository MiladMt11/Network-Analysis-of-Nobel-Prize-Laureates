'''Bengt Ingemar Samuelsson''' (born 21 May 1934) is a Swedish [[biochemist]]. He shared with [[Sune K. Bergström]] and [[John R. Vane]] the 1982 [[Nobel Prize]] for Physiology or Medicine for discoveries concerning [[prostaglandin]]s and related substances.<ref>{{Citation

==Education and early life==
He was born in [[Halmstad]] in southwest [[Sweden]] and studied at [[Stockholm University]], where he became a professor in 1967.

==Research and career==
Discussing the role of [[prostaglandin]]s in the body, Samuelsson explained, "It's a control system for the cells that participates in many biological functions. There are endless possibilities of manipulating this system in drug development."{{fact|date=November 2015}}

His research interests were originally in [[cholesterol]] metabolism with importance to reaction mechanisms. Following the structural work on prostaglandins along with Sune Bergström he was interested mainly in the transformation products of [[arachidonic acid]]. This has led to the identification 
of [[endoperoxide]]s, [[thromboxane]]s and the [[leukotriene]]s, and his group has chiefly been involved in studying the [[chemistry]], [[biochemistry]] and [[biology]] of these compounds and their function in biological control systems. This research has implications in numerous clinical areas, especially in [[thrombosis]], [[inflammation]], and [[allergy]].

This field has grown enormously since those days. Between 1981 and 1995 about three thousand papers per year were published that specifically used the expression "prostaglandins," or related terms such as "prostacyclins," "leukotrienes," and "thromboxanes," in their labels and titles.

Bengt Samuelsson has served as a director on the boards of  [[Pharmacia]] AB,  [[NicOx]] SA and [[Bayer Schering Pharma AG|Schering]] AG and is an advisor to the venture capital fund [[HealthCap]].{{fact|date=November 2015}}

==Awards and honors==
In 1975, he was awarded the [[Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize]] from [[Columbia University]] together with [[Sune K. Bergström]]. He was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1990|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1990]].<ref name=formemrs/>
