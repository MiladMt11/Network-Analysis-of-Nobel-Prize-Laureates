'''Dag Hjalmar Agne Carl Hammarskjöld''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|m|ər|ʃ|ʊ|l|d}} {{respell|HAM|ər|shuuld}},<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/hammarskjold|title=Hammarskjöld|work=[[Collins English Dictionary]]|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]}}</ref> {{IPA-sv|ˈdɑːɡ ˈhâmːarˌɧœld|lang|sv-Dag_Hammarskjöld.ogg}}; 29 July 1905 – 18 September 1961) was a Swedish economist and diplomat who served as the second [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] from April 1953 until his death in [[1961 Ndola United Nations DC-6 crash|a plane crash]] in September 1961. As of 2021, he remains the youngest person to have held the post, having been only 47 years old when he was appointed.

Hammarskjöld's tenure was characterized by efforts to strengthen the newly formed UN both internally and externally. He led initiatives to improve morale and organisational efficiency while seeking to make the UN more responsive to global issues. He presided over the creation of the first UN peacekeeping forces in [[United Nations Emergency Force|Egypt]] and [[United Nations Operation in the Congo|the Congo]] and personally intervened to defuse or resolve diplomatic crises. Hammarskjöld's second term was cut short when he died in a plane crash while en route to [[cease-fire]] negotiations during the [[Congo Crisis]].

Hammarskjöld was and remains well regarded internationally as a capable diplomat and administrator, and his efforts to resolve various global crises led to him being the only [[Posthumous award|posthumous recipient]] of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Nobel Prize facts|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/facts/nobel-prize-facts/|access-date=13 May 2020|publisher=Nobel Foundation}}</ref> He is considered one of the two best UN secretaries-general, along with his successor [[U Thant]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2015/02/09/commentary/world-commentary/next-u-n-secretary-general/|title=Next U.N. secretary general - The Japan Times|date=9 February 2015}} This article names [[Kofi Annan]] as the other one.</ref> and his appointment has been hailed as one of the most notable successes for the organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alvaro-de-soto-/how-not-to-select-the-bes_b_8403780.html|title=How Not to Select the Best UN Secretary-General|date=28 October 2015}}</ref> [[U.S. President]] [[John F.

==Early life and education==
[[File:Östra Storgatan 91.jpg|thumb|left|Hammarskjöld's birthplace in [[Jönköping]].]]
Dag Hammarskjöld was born in [[Jönköping]] to the [[Hammarskjöld family|noble family Hammarskjöld]] (also spelled ''Hammarskiöld'' or ''Hammarsköld''). He spent most of his childhood in [[Uppsala]]. His home there, which he considered his childhood home, was [[Uppsala Castle]]. He was the fourth and youngest son of [[Hjalmar Hammarskjöld]], [[Prime Minister of Sweden]] from 1914 to 1917.<ref name="Sze memoir">{{cite book|last1=Sze|first1=Szeming|title=Working for the United Nations: 1948–1968|date=December 1986|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|location=Pittsburgh|page=20|edition=Digital|url=http://digital.library.pitt.edu/cgi-bin/t/text/text-idx?idno=31735066261623;view=toc;c=ulstext|access-date=7 November 2014}}</ref>

Hammarskjöld studied first at [[Katedralskolan, Uppsala|Katedralskolan]] and then at [[Uppsala University]]. By 1930, he had obtained [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]] of Philosophy and Master of Laws degrees. Before he finished his law degree he had already obtained a job as Assistant Secretary of the Unemployment Committee.<ref name=dag>{{cite web |url=http://www.daghammarskjold.se/biography/#early-life |title=Biography, at Dag Hammerskjoldse |publisher=Daghammarskjold.se|access-date=10 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002221559/http://www.daghammarskjold.se/biography/#early-life |archive-date=2 October 2013}}</ref>

==Career==
From 1930 to 1934, Hammarskjöld was Secretary of a governmental committee on unemployment. During this time he wrote his economics thesis, "''Konjunkturspridningen''" ("The Spread of the Business Cycle"), and received a [[doctorate]] from [[Stockholm University]]. In 1936, he became a secretary in Sweden's central bank, the [[Sveriges Riksbank|Riksbank]]. From 1941 to 1948, he served as chairman of the Riksbank's General Council.<ref name=nobel>[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1961/hammarskjold/biographical/ "Dag Hammarskjöld", The Nobel Prize]</ref>

Hammarskjöld quickly developed a successful career as a Swedish public servant. He was state secretary in the Ministry of Finance 1936–1945, Swedish delegate to the [[OECD|Organization for European Economic Cooperation]] 1947–1953, cabinet secretary for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs 1949–1951 and [[minister without portfolio]] in [[Tage Erlander]]'s government 1951–1953.<ref name=nobel/>

He helped coordinate government plans to alleviate the economic problems of the post-[[World War II]] period and was a delegate to the Paris conference that established the [[Marshall Plan]]. In 1950, he became head of the Swedish delegation to [[UNISCAN]], a forum to promote economic cooperation between the United Kingdom and the Scandinavian countries.<ref>"[http://www.un.org/depts/dhl/dag/bio.htm Dag Hammarskjöld]" [biography]. United Nations. United Nations. Retrieved 13 October 2017.</ref> Although Hammarskjöld served in a cabinet dominated by the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party|Social Democrats]], he never officially joined any political party.<ref name=nobel/>

In 1951, Hammarskjöld was vice chairman of the Swedish delegation to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in Paris. He became the chairman of the Swedish delegation to the [[General Assembly of UN|General Assembly]] in New York in 1952. On 20 December 1954, he was elected to take his father's vacated seat in the [[Swedish Academy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/Depts/dhl/dag/bio.htm|title=DAG HAMMARSKJÖLD: The UN years ...|publisher=United Nations|access-date=25 December 2019}}</ref>

==United Nations Secretary-General==
=== Nomination and election ===
{{see also|United Nations Secretary-General selection, 1953}}

On 10 November 1952 [[Trygve Lie]] announced his resignation as [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]]. Several months of negotiations ensued between the Western powers and the Soviet Union, without reaching an agreement on his successor. On 13 and 19 March 1953, the [[Security Council]] voted on four candidates. [[Lester B. Pearson]] of Canada was the only candidate to receive the required majority, but he was vetoed by the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite news| last1=Hamilton|first1=Thomas J.|title=Soviet Veto Blocks Pearson U.N.

The superpowers hoped to seat a Secretary-General who would focus on administrative issues and refrain from participating in political discussion. Hammarskjöld's reputation at the time was, in the words of biographer Emery Kelèn, "that of a brilliant economist, an unobtrusive technician, and an aristo-bureaucrat". As a result, there was little to no controversy in his selection;{{sfn|Lipsey|2013|p=117}} the Soviet permanent representative, [[Valerian Zorin]], found Hammarskjöld "harmless".{{sfn|Heller|2001|p=14}} Zorin declared that he would be voting for Hammarskjöld, surprising the Western powers.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hamilton | first1=Thomas J.|title=U.N. Chief is Picked | work=The New York Times | page=1 | date=1 April 1953}}</ref> The announcement set off a flurry of diplomatic activity. [[Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom|British Foreign Secretary]] [[Anthony Eden]] was strongly in favor of Hammarskjöld and asked the United States to "take any appropriate action to induce the [Nationalist] Chinese to abstain".<ref name="frus1952-213">{{harvnb|FRUS 1952–1954 III|loc=[https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1952-54v03/d213 Document 213]}}: Memorandum of Telephone Conversation, by the Deputy Director of the Office of United Nations Political and Security Affairs (Popper), 31 March 1953.</ref> (Sweden recognized the People's Republic of China and faced a potential veto from the Republic of China.)

On 31 March 1953, the [[Security Council]] voted 10-0-1 to recommend Hammarskjöld to the General Assembly, with an abstention from Nationalist China.{{sfn|Heller|2001|p=15}} Shortly after midnight on 1 April 1953, Hammarskjöld was awakened by a telephone call from a journalist with the news, which he dismissed as an [[April Fools' Day|April Fool's Day joke]].{{efn|The nomination was leaked early by a delegate of the Security Council, who informed a correspondent of the vote as they left the council chamber to go to the restroom.{{sfn|Lipsey|2013|pp=117–118}} Earlier in March, Hammarskjöld had discussed the succession problem of the UN Secretariat with artist {{interlanguage link|Bo Beskow|de||no||sv}}.

<blockquote>With strong feeling personal insufficiency I hesitate to accept candidature but I do not feel I could refuse to assume the task imposed on me should the [UN General] Assembly follow the recommendation of the Security Council by which I feel deeply honoured.
</blockquote>

Later in the day Hammarskjöld held a press conference at the Swedish Foreign Ministry. According to diplomat [[Sverker Åström]], he displayed an intense interest and knowledge in the affairs of the UN, which he had never shown any indication of before.{{sfn|Lipsey|2013|p=118}}

The U.N. General Assembly voted 57-1-1 on 7 April 1953 to appoint Dag Hammarskjöld as Secretary-General of the United Nations. Hammarskjöld was sworn in as Secretary-General on 10 April 1953.{{sfn|Heller|2001|p=15}} He was unanimously reelected on 26 September 1957 for another term, taking effect on 10 April 1958.{{sfn|Heller|2001|p=21}}

=== Tenure ===
[[File:Dag Hammarskjold outside the UN building.jpg|thumb|Hammarskjöld (age 48) outside the [[United Nations headquarters|UN headquarters]] in [[New York City]], 1953]]
Immediately following the assumption of the Secretariat, Hammarskjöld attempted to establish a good rapport with his staff. He made a point of visiting every UN department to shake hands with as many workers as possible, eating in the cafeteria as often as possible, and relinquishing the Secretary-General's private elevator for general use.{{sfn|Lipsey|2013|p=135}} He began his term by establishing his own secretariat of 4,000 administrators and setting up regulations that defined their responsibilities. He was also actively engaged in smaller projects relating to the UN working environment; for example, he spearheaded the building of a [[Headquarters of the United Nations meditation room|meditation room]] at the [[UN headquarters]], where people can withdraw into themselves in silence, regardless of their faith, creed, or religion.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mary Cherif|author2=Nathalie Leroy|author3=Anna Banchieri|author4=Armando Da Silva|url=https://www.un.org/depts/dhl/dag/meditationroom.htm|title=The Meditation Room in the UN Headquarters|publisher=United Nations|access-date=10 September 2013}}</ref>

During his term, Hammarskjöld tried to improve relations between [[Israel]] and the [[Arab states]]. Other highlights include a 1955 visit to [[People's Republic of China|China]] to negotiate the release of 11 captured US pilots who had served in the [[Korean War]],<ref name="Sze memoir" /> the 1956 establishment of the [[United Nations Emergency Force]], and his intervention in the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]]. He is given credit by some historians for allowing participation of the [[Holy See]] within the United Nations that year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/documents/rc_seg-st_doc_20020422_tauran_en.html |title=Holy See's Presence in the International Organizations|publisher=Vatican.va |date=22 April 2002 |access-date=10 September 2013|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140215051159/https://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/secretariat_state/documents/rc_seg-st_doc_20020422_tauran_en.html |archive-date=15 February 2014}}</ref>

In 1960, the newly independent [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Congo]] asked for UN aid in defusing the [[Congo Crisis]]. Hammarskjöld made four trips to Congo, but his efforts toward the decolonisation of Africa were considered insufficient by the [[Soviet Union]]; in September 1960, the Soviet government denounced his decision to send a UN emergency force to keep the peace. They demanded his resignation and the replacement of the office of Secretary-General by a three-man directorate with a built-in veto, the "[[Triumvirate|troika]]". The objective was, citing the memoirs of Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]], to "equally represent interests of three groups of countries: capitalist, socialist and recently independent".<ref name="un-history60">[https://www.un.org/russian/av/radio/history60/11history60.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061022115139/http://www.un.org/russian/av/radio/history60/11history60.htm |date=22 October 2006 }}</ref><ref name=dag/>

==Death==
{{main|1961 Ndola United Nations DC-6 crash}}
[[File:Dag Hammaskölds gravsten.jpg|thumb|Hammarskjöld's grave in [[Uppsala]]]]
On 18 September 1961, Hammarskjöld was en route to negotiate a [[cease-fire]] between [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]] forces and [[State of Katanga|Katangese]] troops under [[Moise Tshombe]]. His [[Douglas DC-6]] airliner [[1961 Ndola United Nations DC-6 crash|SE-BDY crashed]] near [[Ndola]], [[Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland|Northern Rhodesia]] (now [[Zambia]]). Hammarskjöld perished as a result of the crash, as did all of the 15 other passengers.<ref>{{Cite web|title=RAF veteran ‘admitted 1961 killing of UN secretary general’|last1=Graham-Harrison|first1=Emma|last2=Rocksen|first2=Andreas|last3=Brügger|first3=Mads|work=The Guardian|date=12 January 2019 |access-date=17 September 2021 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/12/raf-veteran-admitted-killing-un-secretary-general-dag-hammarskjold-in-1961}}</ref> Hammarskjöld's death set off a succession crisis at the United Nations,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Halberstam|first1=David|title=Hammarskjold Dies in African Air Crash; Kennedy Going To U.

The circumstances of the crash are still unclear. A 1962 Rhodesian inquiry concluded that pilot error was to blame, while a later UN investigation could not determine the cause of the crash.<ref name="foreignpolicy">{{cite news|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/08/01/u-n-to-probe-whether-iconic-secretary-general-was-assassinated/|title=U.N. to Probe Whether Iconic Secretary-General Was Assassinated|work=Foreign Policy|date=1 August 2016|access-date=17 December 2017|first=Colum|last=Lynch}}</ref> There is evidence suggesting the plane was shot down.<ref>{{cite web | title = Dag Hammarskjöld: evidence suggests UN chief's plane was shot down |work= The Guardian| url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/17/dag-hammarskjold-un-secretary-general-crash |date= 17 August 2011| access-date = 2 August 2014| first = Julian| last = Borger }}</ref><ref name="theguardian042014">{{cite web | title = Dag Hammarskjöld's plane may have been shot down, ambassador warned | work= The Guardian| url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/04/dag-hammarskjold-plane-shot-down-mercenary-cable |date=4 April 2014 |access-date = 2 August 2014| first = Julian | last=Borger }}</ref><ref>Susan Williams, ''Who Killed Hammarskjold?'' 2011, Hurst Publishers, 2014, Oxford University Press</ref> A [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] report claimed the KGB was responsible.<ref name="theguardian2014">Jamie Doward, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/13/spy-messages-solve-mystery-un-chief-death-crash "Spy messages could finally solve mystery of UN chief’s death crash"], ''[[The Guardian]]'' 13 December 2014.</ref>

The day after the crash, former U.S. President [[Harry Truman]] commented that Hammarskjöld "was on the point of getting something done when they killed him. Notice that I said 'when they killed him'."<ref name="theguardian2014"/>

In 1998, documents surfaced suggesting CIA, [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]], and/or Belgian mining interest involvement via a South African paramilitary organization. The information was contained in a file from the [[National Intelligence Agency (South Africa)|South African National Intelligence Agency]] turned over to the [[South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] in relation to the 1993 assassination of [[Chris Hani]], leader of the [[South African Communist Party]]. These documents included an alleged plot to "remove" Hammarskjöld and contained a supposed statement from CIA director [[Allen Dulles]] that "Dag is becoming troublesome … and should be removed." Hammarskjöld's mission to end the war over the mineral-rich Katangese secession from the newly formed [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] was contrary to the interests of those organizations. However these documents were copies rather than originals, precluding substantiation of authenticity through ink and paper testing.<ref name="foreignpolicy"/>

Göran Björkdahl, a Swedish aid worker whose father worked for the UN in Zambia, wrote in 2011 that he believed Hammarskjöld's death was a murder committed, in part, to benefit mining companies like [[Union Minière du Haut Katanga|Union Minière]], after Hammarskjöld had made the UN intervene in the Katanga crisis. Björkdahl based his assertion on interviews with witnesses of the plane crash near the border of the DRC with Zambia and on archival documents.<ref>{{cite web | title = Dag Hammarskjöld: I have no doubt Dag Hammarskjold's plane was brought down |work= The Guardian| url =https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/aug/17/dag-hammarskjold-crash-goran-bjorkdahl|date= 17 August 2011| access-date = 2 August 2014| first = Goran| last = Bjorkdahl}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title = EYEWITNESSES: The Hammarskjold Plane Crash | journal= International Peacekeeping| volume= 20| pages= 98–115|date=February 2013  | first = Goran| last = Bjorkdahl| doi= 10.1080/13533312.2013.763681| s2cid=144859006}}</ref>

In 2013 accident investigator Sven Hammarberg was asked by the [[International Commission of Jurists]] to investigate Hammarskjöld's death.<ref>{{cite news | last1=Hammarberg | first1=Sven | title=Accident Investigator's Report to the Hammarskjöld Commission | url=http://www.hammarskjoldcommission.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Accident-Investigators-report-to-the-Hammarskold-Commission1.pdf | work=Hammarskjöld Commission | date=15 August 2013}}</ref>

In 2014, newly declassified documents revealed that the American ambassador to the Congo sent a cable to Washington D.C. warning that the plane could have been shot down by Belgian mercenary pilot Jan van Risseghem, commander of the small Katanga Air Force. Van Risseghem died in 2007.<ref name="theguardian042014"/>

On 16 March 2015, United Nations Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] appointed members to an Independent Panel of Experts to examine new information related to Hammarskjöld's death. The three-member panel was led by [[Mohamed Chande Othman]], the [[Chief Justice of Tanzania]], and included Kerryn Macaulay (Australia's representative to the ICAO) and Henrik Larsen (a ballistics expert from the Danish National Police).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=50337 |title=UN announces members of panel probing new information on Dag Hammarskjöld death |date=16 March 2015 |publisher=UN News Centre |access-date=18 March 2015}}</ref> The panel's 99-page report, released 6 July 2015, assigned "moderate" value to nine new eyewitness accounts and transcripts of radio transmissions. Those accounts suggested that Hammarskjöld's plane was already on fire as it landed and that other jet aircraft and intelligence agents were nearby.<ref name=NYT06July2015>{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=Panel: Possible Aerial Attack on Hammarskjold Plane in 1961|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/07/06/world/ap-un-united-nations-hammarskjold-review.html|access-date=6 July 2015|work=The New York Times|date=6 July 2015}}</ref>

In 2016, the original documents from the 1998 South African investigation surfaced. Those familiar with the investigation cautioned that even if authentic, the documents could have been initially authored as part of a disinformation campaign.<ref name="foreignpolicy"/>

In 2019, the documentary film ''[[Cold Case Hammarskjöld]]'' by Danish filmmaker [[Mads Brügger]] claimed that Jan van Risseghem had told a friend that he shot down Hammarskjöld's aircraft. This went against the official stance maintained by van Risseghem's family that he was not involved in the death of Hammarskjöld. According to an interview with van Risseghem's wife, he was in Rhodesia negotiating the purchase of a plane for the Katanga Air Force and the logbooks provided "proof that he was not flying for Katanga at the time". The documentary crew interviewed multiple colleagues of van Risseghem for the film, all of whom supported their theory.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/17/world/africa/hammarskjold-crash-mystery.html|title=More Clues, and Questions, in 1961 Crash That Killed Dag Hammarskjold|work=The New York Times|date=17 February 2019|access-date=30 December 2019|last1=Gladstone|first1=Rick|last2=Cowell|first2=Alan}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.svt.se/nyheter/utrikes/nya-uppgifter-legoknekt-ska-ha-erkant-att-han-dodade-dag-hammarskjold|title=Mercenary admits to murder of Dag Hammarskjöld|newspaper=SVT Nyheter|date=13 January 2019|publisher=SVT|access-date=13 January 2019|last1=Ripås|first1=Johan}}</ref><ref name="theguardian2019">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/12/raf-veteran-admitted-killing-un-secretary-general-dag-hammarskjold-in-1961|title=RAF veteran 'admitted 1961 killing of UN secretary general'|work=The Guardian|date=12 January 2019|access-date=13 January 2019}}</ref> In an interview with Swedish historian Leif Hellström, van Risseghem claimed that he was not in southern Africa at the time it happened, and dismissed the idea of being potentially involved as "fairy stories".<ref name="theguardian2019"/>

=== Spirituality and ''Markings'' ===
[[File:Dag Hammarskjöld quote cropped.jpg|thumb|A spiritual quote by Dag Hammarskjöld engraved in the stone wall within the Peace Chapel of the [[International Peace Garden]].]]
In 1953, soon after his appointment as United Nations Secretary-General, Hammarskjöld was interviewed on radio by [[Edward R. Murrow]]. In this talk Hammarskjöld declared:

<blockquote>But the explanation of how man should live a life of active social service in full harmony with himself as a member of the community of spirit, I found in the writings of those great medieval mystics <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[Meister Eckhart]] and [[Jan van Ruysbroek (scholar)|Jan van Ruysbroek]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> for whom 'self-surrender' had been the way to self-realization, and who in 'singleness of mind' and 'inwardness' had found strength to say yes to every demand which the needs of their neighbours made them face, and to say yes also to every fate life had in store for them when they followed the call of duty as they understood it.<ref>Henry P Van Dusen. ''Dag Hammarskjold: A Biographical Interpretation of Markings'' Faber and Faber London 1967 p. 47.</ref></blockquote>

Hammarskjöld's only book, ''[[Vägmärken]]'' (''Markings'', or more literally ''Waymarks''), was published in 1963. A collection of his diary reflections, the book starts in 1925, when he was 20 years old, and ends the month before his death in 1961.<ref name="har05003">Hartman, Thom (3 March 2005).  [https://web.archive.org/web/20051019231821/http://www.buzzflash.com/hartmann/05/03/har05003.html ''Markings - the spiritual diary of Dag Hammarskjöld''].  BuzzFlash.</ref> This diary was found in his New York house, after his death, along with an undated letter addressed to then Swedish Permanent Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Leif Belfrage. In this letter, Hammarskjöld wrote:

<blockquote>These entries provide the only true 'profile' that can be drawn ... If you find them worth publishing, you have my permission to do so.</blockquote>

The foreword is written by the English poet [[W. H. Auden]], a friend of Hammarskjöld's.<ref>Auden, with Leif Sjoberg, translated the book into English. {{cite book|last=Hammarskjold|first=Dag|title=Markings|year=1964|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York}}</ref>

''Markings'' was described by the late theologian Henry P. Van Dusen as "the noblest self-disclosure of spiritual struggle and triumph, perhaps the greatest testament of personal faith written ... in the heat of professional life and amidst the most exacting responsibilities for [[world peace]] and order".<ref>Henry P Van Dusen. ''Dag Hammarskjold: A Biographical Interpretation of Markings'' Faber and Faber London 1967 p. 5</ref> Hammarskjöld wrote, for example:

<blockquote>We are not permitted to choose the frame of our destiny. But what we put into it is ours. He who wills adventure will experience it – according to the measure of his courage. He who wills sacrifice will be sacrificed – according to the measure of his purity of heart.<ref>''Dag Hammarskjold: Markings'' Leif Sjoberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p. 63.</ref></blockquote>

''Markings'' is characterised by Hammarskjöld's intermingling of prose and [[haiku]] poetry in a manner exemplified by the 17th-century Japanese poet [[Matsuo Bashō|Basho]] in his ''[[Narrow Roads to the Deep North]]''.<ref>''Dag Hammarskjold: Markings'' Leif Sjoberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p149</ref> In his foreword to ''Markings'', W. H. Auden quotes Hammarskjöld as stating:

<blockquote>In our age, the road to holiness necessarily passes through the world of action.<ref>WH Auden Foreword to ''Dag Hammarskjold: Markings'' Leif Sjoberg and WH Auden (trans) Faber and Faber London 1964 p. 23.</ref></blockquote>

The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America commemorates the life of Hammarskjöld as a renewer of society, on the anniversary of his death, 18 September.<ref>Gail Ramshaw, ''More Days for Praise: Festivals and Commemorations in Evangelical Lutheran Worship'' (Minneapolis: Augsburg Fortress, the publishing arm of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, 2016), p. 220.</ref>
