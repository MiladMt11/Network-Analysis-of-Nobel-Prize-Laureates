'''Klaus von Klitzing''' ({{IPA-de|klaʊ̯s fɔn ˈklɪ.t͡sɪŋ|lang|De-Klaus von Klitzing.ogg}}, born 28 June 1943, [[Schroda]]) is a German physicist, known for discovery of the [[quantum Hall effect|integer quantum Hall effect]], for which he was awarded the 1985 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].<ref>{{cite web

==Education==
In 1962, Klitzing passed the [[Abitur]] at the [[Artland-Gymnasium]] in [[Quakenbrück]], Germany, before studying physics at the [[Braunschweig University of Technology]], where he received his diploma in 1969. He continued his studies at the [[University of Würzburg]] at the chair of [[Gottfried Landwehr]], completing his PhD thesis entitled ''Galvanomagnetic Properties of Tellurium in Strong Magnetic Fields'' in 1972, and gaining [[habilitation]] in 1978.

==Research and career==
During his career Klitzing has worked at the [[Clarendon Laboratory]] at the [[University of Oxford]] and the Grenoble High Magnetic Field Laboratory in France (now [[LNCMI]]), where he continued to work until becoming a professor at the [[Technical University of Munich]] in 1980. He has been a director of the [[Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research]] in [[Stuttgart]] since 1985.<ref>{{cite journal

The [[von Klitzing constant]], ''R''<sub>K</sub> = ''[[Planck constant|h]]''/[[elementary charge|e]]<sup>2</sup> = {{physconst|RK|after=,}} is named in honor of Klaus von Klitzing's discovery of the [[quantum Hall effect]], and is listed in the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] ''Reference on Constants, Units, and Uncertainty''. The inverse of the constant is equal to half the value of the [[conductance quantum]].

More recently,{{when|date=November 2015}} Klitzing's research focuses on the properties of low-dimensional electronic systems, typically in low [[temperature]]s and in high [[magnetic field]]s.

==Honours and awards==
Von Klitzing has won numerous awards and honours including:
