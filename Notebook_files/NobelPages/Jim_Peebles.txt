== Early life ==
Peebles was born on April 25, 1935 in [[St. Boniface, Winnipeg|St. Boniface]], in present-day [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]], [[Canada]], the son of Ada Marion (Green), a homemaker, and Andrew Charles Peebles, who worked for the [[Winnipeg Grain Exchange]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=piQvAQAAIAAJ&q=%22Andrew+Charles+Peebles%22 |title=Notable Scientists from 1900 to the Present |volume=4 (N–S) |editor-first=Brigham |editor-last=Narins |publisher=Gale Group |year=2001 |edition=2 |isbn=9780787617554 |via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref> He completed his bachelor of science at the [[University of Manitoba]]. He then went on to pursue graduate studies at [[Princeton University]], where he received his [[Ph.D.]] in physics in 1962, completing a doctoral dissertation titled "Observational Tests and Theoretical Problems Relating to the durateston Conjecture That the Strength of the Electromagnetic Interaction May Be Variable" under the supervision of [[Robert Dicke]].<ref name="thesis-peebles-1962">{{cite thesis |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/302111786/ |title=Observational tests and theoretical problems relating to the conjecture that the strength of the electromagnetic interaction may be variable |date=1962 |publisher=[[Princeton University]] |degree=Ph.D. |last=Peebles |first=Phillip James Edwin |via=[[ProQuest]] |url-access=subscription |oclc=83718695}}</ref> He remained at Princeton for his whole career. Peebles was a Member in the School of Natural Sciences at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] during the academic year 1977–78; he made subsequent visits during 1990–91 and 1998–99.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ias.edu/scholars/phillip-james-e-peebles|title=Phillip James E. Peebles|website=[[Institute for Advanced Study]]|access-date=October 8, 2019}}</ref>

==Academic career==
Most of Peebles' work since 1964 has been in the field of [[physical cosmology]] to determine the origins of the universe. In 1964, there was very little interest in this field and it was considered a "dead end" but Peebles remained committed to studying it.<ref name="princeton nobel">{{cite web | url = https://www.princeton.edu/news/2019/10/08/joy-ride-career-peebles-wins-nobel-prize-physics-tackling-big-questions-about | title =  A 'joy ride' of a career: Peebles wins Nobel Prize in Physics for tackling big questions about the universe | first = Tom | last = Garlinghouse | date = October 8, 2019 | access-date = October 9, 2019 | publisher = [[Princeton University]] }}</ref> Peebles has made many important contributions to the [[Big Bang]] model. With Dicke and others (nearly two decades after [[George Gamow]], [[Ralph A. Alpher]] and [[Robert Herman|Robert C. Herman]]), Peebles predicted the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. Along with making major contributions to [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]], [[dark matter]], and [[dark energy]], he was the leading pioneer in the theory of cosmic [[structure formation]] in the 1970s. Long before it was considered a serious, quantitative branch of physics, Peebles was studying physical cosmology and has done much to establish its respectability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ias.edu/ideas/2015/thomas-general-relativity|title=General Relativity's Influence and Mysteries|website=Institute for Advanced Study|language=en|access-date=October 8, 2019}}</ref> Peebles said, "It was not a single step, some critical discovery that suddenly made cosmology relevant but the field gradually emerged through a number of experimental observations. Clearly one of the most important during my career was the detection of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation that immediately attracted attention [...] both experimentalists interested in measuring the properties of this radiation and theorists, who joined in analyzing the implications".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ep-news.web.cern.ch/content/interview-james-peebles|title=Interview with James Peebles|website= CERN EP newsletter|language=en|access-date=May 4, 2016}}</ref>  His Shaw Prize citation states "He laid the foundations for almost all modern investigations in cosmology, both theoretical and observational, transforming a highly speculative field into a precision science."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shawprize.org/en/shaw.php?tmp=3&twoid=53&threeid=67&fourid=123|title=Announcement-The Shaw Laureate in Astronomy 2004|publisher=Shaw Foundation|access-date=January 27, 2016}}</ref>

Peebles has a long record of innovating the basic ideas, which would be extensively studied later by other scientists. For instance, in 1987, he proposed the [[primordial isocurvature baryon model]] for the development of the early universe.<ref>Hu (June 28, 1994)</ref> Similarly, Peebles contributed to establishing the dark matter problem in the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=de Swart|first1=J.

Peebles' body of work was recognized with him being named a 2019 Nobel Laureate in Physics, "for theoretical discoveries in physical cosmology"; Peebles shared half the prize with [[Michel Mayor]] and [[Didier Queloz]] who had been the first to discover an [[exoplanet]] around a [[main sequence]] star.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/08/science/nobel-physics.html | title = Nobel Prize in Physics Awarded for Studies of Earth's Place in the Universe | first1 = Kenneth | last1 = Chang | first2 = Megan | last2 = Specia | date = October 8, 2019 | access-date = October 9, 2019 | work = [[The New York Times]] }}</ref>
