'''John Michael Bishop''' (born February 22, 1936) is an [[United States|American]] [[immunologist]] and [[microbiologist]] who shared the 1989 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] with [[Harold E. Varmus]] and was co-winner of 1984 [[Alfred P. Sloan Prize]].<ref>[http://visualsonline.cancer.gov/details.cfm?imageid=8172 NCI Visuals Online: Image Details]. Visualsonline.cancer.gov.

== Education and early life ==
Bishop was born in [[Pennsylvania]].  He attended [[Gettysburg College]] as an undergraduate, where he was a brother of the Theta-Pi Zeta chapter of [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] fraternity. He later attended [[Harvard University]], where he earned an [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] in 1962.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Career==
Bishop began his career working for the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]], a part of the [[National Institutes of Health]].  He then spent a year working for the [[Heinrich Pette Institute]] in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]] before joining the faculty of the [[University of California, San Francisco]] in 1968.<ref name="ucsf"/> Bishop has remained on the school's faculty since 1968, and was chancellor of the university from 1998 to 2009.<ref name="stepdown"/> He is director of the Bishop Lab.<ref>[http://hooper.ucsf.edu/hooper/bishop_lab.html Bishop Lab]. Hooper.ucsf.edu. Retrieved on 2013-11-24. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223641/http://hooper.ucsf.edu/hooper/bishop_lab.html |date=December 2, 2013 }}</ref>

He became the eighth chancellor of UCSF in 1998. He oversaw one of UCSF's major transition and growth periods, including the expanding Mission Bay development and philanthropic support recruitment. During his tenure, he unveiled the first comprehensive, campus-wide, strategic plan to promote diversity and foster a supportive work environment. During this time, UCSF also adopted a new mission: ''advancing health worldwide''™.<ref>{{cite web|title=John Michael Bishop - Biography - A History of UCSF|url=http://history.library.ucsf.edu/bishop.html|website=history.library.ucsf.edu|language=en}}</ref>

==Research==
Much of this work was conducted jointly with Harold Varmus in a notably long scientific partnership. Their best-known accomplishment<ref>{{Cite journal|last1 = Stehelin|first1 = D.|last2 = Varmus|first2 = H. E.|last3 = Bishop|first3 = J. M.|last4 = Vogt|first4 = P. K.|date = 1976-03-11|title = DNA related to the transforming gene(s) of avian sarcoma viruses is present in normal avian DNA|journal = Nature|language = en|volume = 260|issue = 5547|pages = 170–173|doi = 10.1038/260170a0|pmid = 176594|bibcode = 1976Natur.260..170S|s2cid = 4178400}}</ref> was the identification of a cellular gene (c-src) that gave rise to the v-src oncogene of Rous Sarcoma Virus, a cancer-causing virus first isolated from a chicken sarcoma by [[Peyton Rous]] in 1910.  Their discovery triggered the identification of many other cellular proto-oncogenes—progenitors of viral oncogenes and targets for mutations that drive human cancers.

==Awards and honors==
Bishop is best known for his Nobel-winning work on [[retrovirus|retroviral]] [[oncogenes]].  Working with [[Harold E. Varmus]] in the 1980s, he discovered the first human oncogene, [[Src (gene)#c-src|c-Src]].  Their findings allowed the understanding of how malignant [[tumor]]s are formed from changes to the normal [[gene]]s of a [[Cell (biology)|cell]].  These changes can be produced by viruses, by radiation, or by exposure to some chemicals.<ref name="nopress"/><ref>[http://ucsfcat.library.ucsf.edu/record=b1894718~S0 Michael Bishop archival collection at UCSF]</ref><ref>[http://www.accessexcellence.org/RC/AB/BC/J_Michael_Bishop.php J.

Bishop is also a recipient of [[National Medal of Science]] in 2003.<ref name="nms"/> That same year, his book  "How to win the Nobel Prize: An Unexpected Life in Science" was published. He was elected [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 2008|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2008]].<ref name=formemrs>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151021080638/https://royalsociety.org/people/j-michael-bishop-11093/

In 2020, Bishop received from the [[UC Berkeley]] Academic Senate the Clark Kerr Award for distinguished leadership in higher education. <ref>{{Cite web|title=History of the Clark Kerr Award {{!}} Academic Senate|url=https://academic-senate.berkeley.edu/senate-service/awards/clark-kerr-award/clark-kerr-award-history|access-date=2021-02-13|website=academic-senate.berkeley.edu}}</ref>
