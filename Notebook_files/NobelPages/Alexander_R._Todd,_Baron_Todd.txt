==Early life and education==
Todd was born in [[Cathcart]] in outer [[Glasgow]], the son of Alexander Todd, a clerk with the Glasgow Subway, and his wife, Jane Lowry.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 770414|title = Alexander Robertus Todd, O.

He attended [[Allan Glen's School]] and graduated from the [[University of Glasgow]] with a [[bachelor's degree|BSc]] in 1928. He received a [[doctorate|PhD (Dr.phil.nat.)]] from [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main]] in 1931 for his thesis on the chemistry of the [[bile]] acids.

Todd was awarded an [[1851 Research Fellowship]] from the [[Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851]],<ref>1851 Royal Commission Archives</ref> and, after studying at [[Oriel College, Oxford]], he gained another doctorate in 1933.

==Career==
Todd held posts with the [[Lister Institute]], the [[University of Edinburgh]] (staff, 1934–1936) and the [[University of London]], where he was appointed [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in [[Biochemistry]].

In 1938, Alexander Todd spent six months as a visiting professor at [[California Institute of Technology]], eventually declining an offer of faculty position.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1957/todd-bio.html|title=Lord Todd – Biographical|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2018-01-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVtMCAAAQBAJ&q=Alexander+R.+Todd+caltech&pg=PT152|title=The Molecular Vision of Life: Caltech, the Rockefeller Foundation, and the Rise of the New Biology|last=Kay|first=Lily E.|date=1992-12-03|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-028161-8|language=en}}</ref> Todd became the [[Sir Samuel Hall Chair of Chemistry]] and Director of the Chemical Laboratories of the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] in 1938, where he began working on nucleosides, compounds that form the structural units of nucleic acids ([[DNA]] and [[RNA]]).

In 1944, he was appointed to the [[BP Professor of Organic Chemistry|1702 Chair of Chemistry]] in the [[University of Cambridge]], which he held until his retirement in 1971.<ref>{{citation|title=The 1702 chair of chemistry at Cambridge: transformation and change|first1=Mary D. |last1=Archer|author-link=Mary Archer|first2= Christopher D. |last2=Haley

In 1955, he helped elucidate the structure of [[vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]], although the final formula and definite structure was determined by [[Dorothy Hodgkin]] and her team, and later worked on the structure and synthesis of [[vitamin B1|vitamin B<sub>1</sub>]] and [[vitamin E]], the [[anthocyanins]] (the pigments of flowers and fruits) from insects (aphids, beetles) and studied [[alkaloids]] found in [[hashish]] and [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]]. He served as chairman of the [[Government of the United Kingdom]]'s advisory committee on [[science policy|scientific policy]] from 1952 to 1964.

He was elected a [[Fellow]] of [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] in 1944 and was [[Christ's College, Cambridge#Masters of Christ's|Master]] from 1963 to 1978.

In 1937, Todd married Alison Sarah Dale (d.1987), daughter of Nobel Prize winner Sir [[Henry Hallett Dale|Henry Dale]], who, as Todd did, served as President of the [[Royal Society of London]]. They had a son, Alexander Henry, and two daughters, Helen Jean and Hilary Alison.

==Honours==
Todd was honoured as a Nieuwland Lecturer at the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1948,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Vitamins, coenzymes and nucleotides; a series of lectures presented at the University of Notre Dame on October 22, 25 and 27, 1948.|last=Todd|first=Alexander R|date=1949|publisher=University of Notre Dame|location=Notre Dame, Ind.|language=en|oclc = 6142088}}</ref> an Arthur D.
