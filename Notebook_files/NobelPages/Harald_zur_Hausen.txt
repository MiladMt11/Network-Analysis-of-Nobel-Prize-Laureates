'''Harald zur Hausen''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhaʁalt tsuːɐ̯ ˈhaʊzn̩|-|De-Harald zur Hausen.ogg}}; born 11 March 1936) is a German [[virology|virologist]] and [[professor emeritus]]. He has done research on [[cancer of the cervix]], where he discovered the role of [[papilloma viruses]], for which he received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] 2008.

==Early life and education==
Zur Hausen was born in [[Gelsenkirchen]], Germany, in a Catholic family. went to the [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] in [[Vechta]], and studied [[medicine]] at the Universities of [[University of Bonn|Bonn]], [[University of Hamburg|Hamburg]] and [[University of Düsseldorf|Düsseldorf]] and received a [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree in 1960 from the University of Düsseldorf, after which he became a medical assistant.

==Career==
{{Tone|section|date=October 2016}}
Two years later, he joined the Institute for Microbiology at the University of Düsseldorf as a laboratory assistant. After three and a half years, he moved to [[Philadelphia]] and worked at the Virus Laboratories of the [[Children's Hospital of Philadelphia|Children's Hospital]] together with the famous husband and wife virologists, [[Werner Henle|Werner]] and [[Gertrude Henle]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/manuscripts/ead/henle.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=27 May 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804142718/http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/manuscripts/ead/henle.html |archive-date=4 August 2009 }}</ref>  who had to escape from Nazi Germany. In a ground-breaking study, he contributed to finding for the first time that a cancer virus (Epstein-Barr virus) can transform healthy cells (lymphocytes) into cancer cells.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Henle |first=Werner |title=Herpes-Type Virus and Chromosome Marker in Normal Leukocytes after Growth with Irradiated Burkitt Cells &#124; Science |doi = 10.1126/science.157.3792.1064 |pmid=6036237 |date=1 September 1967 |volume=157 |issue=3792 |journal=Science |pages=1064–1065|s2cid=30764560 }}</ref>  This directly showed that viruses can cause cancer cell formation.   He became an assistant professor at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. In 1969, he became a regular teaching and researching professor at the [[University of Würzburg]], where he worked at the Institute for Virology. In 1972, he moved to the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg]].  In 1977, he moved on to the [[University of Freiburg]] (Breisgau), where he headed the department of virology and hygiene. Working with [[Lutz Gissmann]], zur Hausen first isolated human papillomavirus 6 by simple centrifugation from genital warts.  Together with Ethel-Michele de Villiers, who would marry zur Hausen after his divorce from his first wife, this group isolated HPV 6 DNA from genital warts, suggesting a possible new way of identifying viruses in human tumors. This paid off several years later in 1983 when zur Hausen identified HPV 16 DNA in cervical cancer tumors by [[Southern blot]] hybridization.<ref>{{cite journal|author=M Dürst |author2=L Gissmann |author3=H Ikenberg |author4=H zur Hausen |title=A papillomavirus DNA from a cervical carcinoma and its prevalence in cancer biopsy samples from different geographic regions |journal=PNAS | volume=80 |issue=12 |pages=3812–3815 |date=1 June 1983 |doi=10.1073/pnas.80.12.3812|pmid=6304740 |pmc=394142 |bibcode=1983PNAS...80.3812D |doi-access=free }}</ref>  This was followed by discovery of HPV18 a year later,<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=557488&blobtype=pdf |format=PDF |title=A new type of papillomavirus DNA, its presence in genital cancer biopsies and in cell lines derived from cervical cancer |date=1984  |access-date=17 October 2016 |pmc=557488 |pmid=6329740 |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=1151–7 | last1 = Boshart | first1 = M | last2 = Gissmann | first2 = L | last3 = Ikenberg | first3 = H | last4 = Kleinheinz | first4 = A | last5 = Scheurlen | first5 = W | last6 = Hausen | first6 = H | journal=EMBO J.|doi=10.1002/j.1460-2075.1984.tb01944.x }}</ref>  thus identifying the culprits responsible for ~75% of human cervical cancer. This sparked a major scientific controversy with other scientists favoring herpes simplex as a cause for cervical cancer.

From 1983 until 2003, zur Hausen served as a chairman and member of the scientific advisory board of the [[German Cancer Research Center]] ([[DKFZ|Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum]], [[DKFZ]] in German) in [[Heidelberg]] and professor of medicine at the [[Heidelberg University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/univ/nobel.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225081327/http://www.uni-heidelberg.de/univ/nobel.html |archive-date=25 December 2008 }}</ref> He also is editor-in-chief of the ''[[International Journal of Cancer]]''. He is author of the book ''Infections Causing Human Cancer'' from 2006.

On 1 January 2010, zur Hausen became the president of the [[German Cancer Aid]], the leading  organization fighting cancer in [[Europe]]. It was founded by doctor [[Mildred Scheel]], the late “First Lady” of Germany. Zur Hausen has three sons from his first wife.

==Scientific merits==
Zur Hausen's specific field of research is the study of [[oncovirus]]es. In 1976, he published the hypothesis that [[human papillomavirus]] plays an important role in the cause of [[cervical cancer]]. Together with his collaborators, he then identified HPV16 and HPV18 in cervical cancers in 1983–4.  This research directly made possible the development of a [[vaccine]] which was introduced in 2006.  See also [[HPV vaccine]]. He is also credited with discovery of the virus causing [[genital warts]] (HPV 6) and a monkey lymphotropic polyomavirus that is a close relative to a recently discovered human [[Merkel cell polyomavirus]], as well as techniques to immortalize cells with Epstein-Barr virus and to induce replication of the virus using phorbol esters.  His work on papillomaviruses and cervical cancer received a great deal of scientific criticism on initial unveiling {{Citation needed|date=December 2021}} but subsequently was confirmed {{Citation needed|date=December 2021}} and extended to other high-risk papillomaviruses.

He received the [[Gairdner Foundation International Award]] in 2008 for his contributions to medical science.<ref name=gairdner-hausen>{{cite web |url=http://www.gairdner.org/awards/awardees2/2008/2008awarde/haraldzurh |title=Harald zur Hausen |access-date=25 May 2008 |publisher=The Gairdner Foundation |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724002326/http://www.gairdner.org/awards/awardees2/2008/2008awarde/haraldzurh |archive-date=24 July 2008 }}</ref> He also shared the 2008 [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] with [[Luc Montagnier]] and [[Françoise Barré-Sinoussi]], who discovered the [[human immunodeficiency virus]].<ref name=nobel-physiology-medicine-2008>{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2008/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2008 |access-date=6 October 2008 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=6 October 2008 }} 2008 Nobel Prize winner "for his discovery of human papilloma viruses causing cervical cancer"</ref>

There was controversy over the 2008 Nobel when it was learned that Bo Angelin, a member of the Nobel Assembly that year, also sat on the board of [[AstraZeneca]], a company which earns [[patent]] royalties for HPV vaccines.<ref name="ScienceInsider">{{cite news|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2008/12/a-nobel-prize-f.html|title=A Nobel Prize for Overblown Controversy?|last=Cohen|first=Jon|date=15 December 2008|work=Science Insider|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|access-date=27 July 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130614070051/http://news.sciencemag.org/scienceinsider/2008/12/a-nobel-prize-f.html|archive-date=14 June 2013}}</ref> This was exacerbated by the fact that AstraZeneca had also entered into a partnership with Nobel Web and Nobel Media to sponsor documentaries and lectures to increase awareness of the prize.<ref name="ScienceInsider"/> However, colleagues widely felt that the award was deserved,<ref name="ScienceMag">{{Cite journal | last1 = Cohen | first1 = J. | last2 = Enserink | first2 = M. | doi = 10.1126/science.322.5899.174 | title = HIV, HPV Researchers Honored, but One Scientist is Left Out | journal = Science | volume = 322 | issue = 5899 | pages = 174–175 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18845715| s2cid = 206582472 }}</ref> and the secretary of the Nobel Committee and Assembly made a statement that at the time of the vote, Bo Angelin did not know of AstraZeneca's HPV vaccine patents.<ref name="ScienceInsider"/>
