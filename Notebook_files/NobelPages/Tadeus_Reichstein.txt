'''Tadeusz Reichstein''' (20 July 1897 – 1 August 1996) was a [[Poles|Polish]]-[[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[chemist]] and the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] laureate (1950), which was awarded for his work on the isolation of [[cortisone]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Rothschild | first1 = M. | author-link = Miriam Rothschild| doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1999.0030 | title = Tadeus Reichstein. 20 July 1897 -- 1 August 1996: Elected For.Mem.R.S. 1952 | journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 45 | pages = 449–467 | year = 1999 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal

==Early life==
Reichstein was born into a [[Polish Jews|Polish-Jewish]] family at [[Włocławek]], [[Russian Empire]]. His parents were Gastawa (Brockmann) and Izydor Reichstein.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1950/reichstein-bio.html?print=1|title=Tadeus Reichstein - his great great great nephew is Noah Reichstein. Biographical|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=12 April 2018}}</ref> He spent his early childhood at [[Kiev]], where his father was an engineer. He began his education at boarding-school in [[Jena]], [[Germany]] and arrived in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]] at the age of 8.

==Career==
Reichstein studied under [[Hermann Staudinger]] during the latter's brief stint at the [[Technical University of Karlsruhe]]. It was here that he met [[Leopold Ruzicka]], also a doctoral student.<ref name=frs/>

In 1933, working in [[Zürich]], Switzerland, at the [[ETHZ]] chemical laboratories of Ruzicka, Reichstein succeeded, independently of Sir [[Norman Haworth]] and his collaborators in the United Kingdom, in synthesizing [[vitamin C]] (ascorbic acid) in what is now called the [[Reichstein process]].<ref name="frs">{{cite journal | last1 = Prelog | first1 = Vladimir | author-link1 = Vladimir Prelog| last2 = Jeger | first2 = Oskar | doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1980.0013 | title = Leopold Ruzicka (13 September 1887 &ndash; 26 September 1976) | journal = [[Biogr. Mem. Fellows R. Soc.]] | volume = 26 | pages = 411–501 | year = 1980 | doi-access = free }}</ref> In 1937, he was appointed Associate Professor at ETHZ.<ref name=frs/>

In 1937, Reichstein moved to the [[University of Basle]] where he became Professor of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, and then, from 1946 until his retirement in 1967, of Organic Chemistry.<ref name=frs/>

Together with [[Edward Calvin Kendall]] and [[Philip Showalter Hench]], he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1950 for their work on [[hormones]] of the [[adrenal cortex]] which culminated in the isolation of [[cortisone]]. In 1951, he and Kendall were jointly awarded the [[Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh]].

In later years, Reichstein became interested in the phytochemistry and [[cytology]] of ferns, publishing at least 80 papers on these subjects in the last three decades of his life. He had a particular interest in the use of [[chromosome]] number and behavior in the interpretation of histories of hybridization and [[polyploidy]], but also continued his earlier interest in the chemical constituents of the plants.

==Retirement and death==
Reichstein died at the age of 99 in [[Basel]], Switzerland. The principal industrial process for the artificial synthesis of vitamin C still bears his name. Reichstein was the longest-lived Nobel laureate at the time of his death, but was surpassed in 2008 by [[Rita Levi-Montalcini]].
