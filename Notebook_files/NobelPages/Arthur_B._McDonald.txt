== Academic career ==
Art McDonald worked as a research officer at the [[Chalk River Nuclear Laboratories]] northwest of [[Ottawa]] from 1969 to 1982. He became professor of physics at [[Princeton University]] from 1982 to 1989, leaving Princeton to join [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]] where he became professor from 1989 to 2013.

McDonald was a visiting scientist at the [[CERN|European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)]] in [[Geneva]] in 2004.<ref name="nobelprizeII" />

In 2013 McDonald became a [[Emeritus#In academia|professor emeritus]] of [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]] in [[Kingston, Canada]]. He continues to be active in basic research in Neutrinos and Dark Matter at the [[SNOLAB]] underground Laboratory and was a past member of the board of the [[Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics]].<ref name=cv /><ref name=sno>{{cite web |url=http://www.sciencewatch.com/jan-feb2004/sw_jan-feb2004_page3.htm |title=Interview with Arthur B.

== Research ==
[[File:Arthur B. McDonald.webm|thumb|261px|McDonald presenting himself and his research]]

Physicists have been investigating whether or not [[neutrino]]s have mass. Since the late 1960s, experiments have hinted that neutrinos may have mass. Theoretical models of the [[Sun]] predict that neutrinos should be made in large numbers. Neutrino detectors on the [[Earth]] have repeatedly seen fewer than the expected number of neutrinos. Because neutrinos come in three varieties (electron, muon, and tau neutrinos), and because solar neutrino detectors have been primarily sensitive only to electron neutrinos, the preferred explanation over the years is that those "missing" neutrinos had changed, or oscillated, into a variety for which the detectors had little or no sensitivity. If a [[neutrino oscillation|neutrino oscillates]], according to the laws of [[quantum mechanics]], then it must have a mass.<ref name=sno />

In 1984, McDonald's collaborator [[Herb Chen]] at the [[University of California at Irvine]] suggested the advantages of using heavy water as a detector for solar neutrinos.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Direct Approach to Resolve the Solar-Neutrino Problem |first=Herbert H. |last=Chen |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=55 |issue=14 |pages=1534–1536 |date=September 1985 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.55.1534|pmid=10031848 |bibcode = 1985PhRvL..55.1534C }}</ref> Unlike previous detectors, using heavy water would make the detector sensitive to two reactions, one reaction sensitive to all neutrino flavours, the other sensitive to only the electron neutrino.  Thus, such a detector could measure neutrino oscillations directly.  Chen, Professor George Ewan, Professor David Sinclair, McDonald, and 12 other scientists formed the original [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]] (SNO) collaboration to exploit this idea in 1984.<ref name="nobelprizeII">{{cite web | url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2015/mcdonald-bio.html | title = The Nobel Prize in Physics 2015 | access-date = 2016-12-15}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| first1=G.T.|last1=Ewan | first2=W.F.| last2=Davidson|journal=Physics in Canada|title=Early Development of the Underground SNO Laboratory in Canada|volume=61|year=2005|pages=339–346, 347–350|url=http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/papers/EwanAndDavidsonEarlyDevelopmentofSNO.pdf|access-date=13 December 2016}}</ref>  SNO was to be a detector facility using 1000 tonnes of heavy water located {{convert|6800|ft}} underground in a mine outside Sudbury, Ontario.  Chen died of leukemia in November 1987, however.

In August 2001, the [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]], led by McDonald since 1989, reported observations that directly suggested electron neutrinos from the Sun were oscillating into muon and tau neutrinos.  McDonald is a co-recipient of the 2007 [[Benjamin Franklin Medal (Franklin Institute)|Benjamin Franklin Medal]] in Physics, the 2015 [[List of Nobel laureates in Physics|Nobel Prize in Physics]], and the [[Fundamental Physics Prize|2015 Fundamental Physics Prize]] for the discovery of [[Neutrino Oscillation|neutrino oscillations]] and demonstrating that neutrinos have mass.<ref name=franklin>{{cite web|title=Arthur B.

Professor McDonald is now participating in research with the SNO+ and DEAP-3600 experiments at SNOLAB, an expanded underground laboratory at the original SNO underground site and with the DarkSide-20k collaboration developing an experiment at the underground laboratory near Gran Sasso, Italy. 

==Arthur B. McDonald Canadian Astroparticle Physics Research Institute==
The Arthur B. McDonald Canadian Astroparticle Physics Research Institute was inaugurally named the Candian Particle Astrophysics Research Centre before renaming itself the Arthur B. McDonald Canadian Astroparticle Physics Research Institute in May 2018, in recognition of Dr. Arthur B. McDonald's trailblazing work making Canada a leader in astroparticle physics.  

== Humanitarian work ==
In the spring of 2020, amid the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] and the ensuing shortages, McDonald became one of the leaders of a project to mass-produce mechanical [[ventilator]]s at low cost.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.queensu.ca/gazette/stories/easy-build-ventilators|title=Easy=to-build ventilators|first=Melinda|last=Knox|publisher=Queen's Gazette|date=2020-04-07|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref> McDonald has stated that the project was initiated by Princeton Professor [https://phy.princeton.edu/people/cristiano-galbiati Cristiano Galbiati] who was locked down in Milan Italy. He inspired action by his colleagues on the DarkSide-20k Dark Matter physics experiment after recognizing the similarities between the requirements of a ventilator and those of particle physics experiments.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-nobel-laureate-leads-push-for-simple-made-in-canada-ventilator/|title=Nobel laureate leads push for simple made-in-Canada ventilator|first=Ivan|last=Semeniuk|publisher=The Globe and Mail|date=2020-03-29|access-date=2020-04-29}}</ref> McDonald led the Canadian team with members from TRIUMF laboratory, CNL Chalk River, SNOLAB and the McDonald Canadian Astroparticle Physics Research Institute after strong positive response from the Directors of these institutions.
