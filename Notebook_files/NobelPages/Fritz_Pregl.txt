'''Fritz Pregl''' (in [[Slovene language|Slovene]] also ''Friderik Pregl''; 3 September 1869 – 13 December 1930), was a Slovenian and Austrian [[chemist]] and [[physician]] from a mixed [[Slovene Language|Slovene]]-[[German Language|German]]-speaking background. He won the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1923 for making important contributions to [[quantitative analysis (chemistry)|quantitative]] [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[microanalysis]], one of which was the improvement of the [[combustion train]] technique for [[elemental analysis]].

==Biography==
[[File:19 Gosposka, Ljubljana.jpg|thumb|left|Pregl's birthplace on Gentry Street (''Gosposka ulica''), Ljubljana]]
Pregl was born in [[Ljubljana]] within [[Austria-Hungary]] to a Slovene-speaking father and German-speaking mother. He died in [[Graz]], [[Austria]] in 1930.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pregl, Nobel Prize Bio-Chemist, Dies |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/67612424/fritz-pregl-1869-1930/ |newspaper=Daily News |date=December 15, 1930 |place=Los Angeles, CA |page=1 |via = [[Newspapers.com]] |access-date=January 14, 2021}} {{Open access}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Dr. Fritz Pregl Dies in Vienna Saturday |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/67612399/fritz-pregl-1969-1930/ |newspaper=The Atlanta Constitution |date=December 14, 1930 |place=Atlanta, GA |page=4 |via = [[Newspapers.com]] |access-date=January 14, 2021}} {{Open access}}</ref>

Pregl started his career as [[chemist]] after he studied medicine at the [[University of Graz]].{{cn|date=August 2017}} With his focus on [[physiology]] and especially chemical physiology, he suffered from the limitations of [[quantitative analysis (chemistry)|quantitative]] [[organic chemistry|organic]] [[microanalysis]]. The small quantities of substances he obtained during the research of [[bile acid]] made it necessary to improve the process of [[elemental analysis]] by reducing the necessary components. At the end of his research, he had lowered the minimal amount of substance necessary for the analysis process by a factor of 50. He invited chemists to learn his method of elemental analysis, so that the method was soon widely accepted.

==Commemoration==
In 1950, the department of the [[University of Graz]] where Fritz Pregl had worked was named the [[Institute of Medical Chemistry and Pregl Laboratory]]. Streets in Graz, Innsbruck, Vienna and Klagenfurt were named after him. In Slovenia, [[Pregl Award]]s have been bestowed annually since 2007 by the [[National Institute of Chemistry (Slovenia)|National Institute of Chemistry]] for the research work and for outstanding [[doctorate]]s. Slovenian pupils are conferred Pregl Recognition Awards, whereas secondary school students are conferred Pregl Citations for excellent results in national competitions in chemistry. A square in Ljubljana is named after Pregl.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.koz.si/megakviz/Data/pregl.pdf |title=Friderik Pregl |journal=Slovenski knjižnično-muzejski megakviz |volume=10/11 |first=Ivanka |last=Učakar |author2=Žiga Rangus |publisher=Ljubljana City Library |date=January 2011 |language=sl }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The [[Fritz Pregl Prize]] has been awarded annually since 1931 in chemistry by the [[Austrian Academy of Sciences]] from the funds left at its disposal by Pregl.
