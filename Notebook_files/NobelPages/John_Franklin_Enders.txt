After returning from [[World War I]], he graduated from [[Yale University|Yale]], where he was a member of [[Scroll and Key]] as well as [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]]. He went into real estate in 1922, and tried several careers before choosing the biomedical field with a focus on infectious diseases, gaining a [[Ph.D.]] at [[Harvard]] in 1930. He later joined the faculty at [[Children's Hospital Boston]].<ref name="NobelBio"/>

Enders died at his summer home in [[Waterford, Connecticut]], aged 88, on 8 September, 1985.<ref name="Ofgang2020"/> His wife died in 2000.

==Biomedical career==

In 1949, Enders, [[Thomas Huckle Weller]], and [[Frederick Chapman Robbins]] reported successful ''[[in vitro]]'' culture of an [[animal virus]]—[[poliovirus]].<ref name=Enders>{{cite journal |vauthors=Enders JF, Weller TH, Robbins FC |title=Cultivation of the Lansing strain of poliomyelitis virus in cultures of various human embryonic tissues |journal=Science |volume=109 |issue=2822 |pages=85–87 |year=1949 |pmid=17794160 |doi=10.1126/science.109.2822.85 |bibcode=1949Sci...109...85E }}</ref>  The three received the 1954 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] "for their discovery of the ability of [[poliovirus|poliomyelitis viruses]] to grow in cultures of various types of tissue".<ref name="Nobel1954">{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1954 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1954/enders/facts/ |website=NobelPrize.org |access-date=13 February 2021 |quote=Prize motivation: ''for their discovery of the ability of poliomyelitis viruses to grow in cultures of various types of tissue.''}}</ref>

Meanwhile, [[Jonas Salk]] applied the Enders-Weller-Robbins technique to produce large quantities of poliovirus, and then developed a [[polio vaccine]] in 1952. Upon the 1954 polio vaccine field trial, whose success Salk announced on the radio,<ref>[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&id=6848 "Salk announces polio vaccine"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211003921/http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&id=6848 |date=2010-02-11 }}. ''History.com''. 2010. Retrieved 31 Jan 2010.</ref> Salk became a public hero but failed to credit the many other researchers that his effort rode upon, and was somewhat shunned by America's scientific establishment.<ref>Balik R, [http://www.findingdulcinea.com/news/on-this-day/April/Polio-Vaccination-Introduced-to-Public.html "On this day: Polio vaccine declared safe"], FindingDulcinea, 12 Apr 2011.</ref>

In 1954, Enders and [[Thomas C. Peebles]] isolated [[measles virus|measlesvirus]] from an 11-year-old boy, David Edmonston.<ref name=Baker>{{cite journal |author=Baker JP |title=The first measles vaccine |journal=Pediatrics |year=2011 |volume=128 |number=3 |pages=435–7 |doi=10.1542/peds.2011-1430|pmid=21873696 |doi-access=free }}</ref>  Disappointed by polio vaccine's development and involvement in some cases of polio and death—what Enders attributed to Salk's technique—Enders began development of [[measles vaccine]].<ref name=Baker/>  In October 1960, an Enders team began trials on 1,500 mentally retarded children in New York City and on 4,000 children in [[Nigeria]].<ref name=Bakalar>Bakalar N, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/health/05first.html "First mention: Measles vaccine, 1960"], ''New York Times'', 5 Oct 2010, p D2.</ref>
Refusing credit for merely himself when ''[[The New York Times]]'' announced the measles vaccine effective on September 17, 1961, Enders wrote to the newspaper to acknowledge the work of various colleagues and the collaborative nature of the research.<ref name="Ofgang2020"/><ref name=Bakalar/> In 1963, a deactivated measles vaccine and an attenuated measles vaccine were introduced by [[Pfizer]] and [[Merck & Co.]], respectively.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Webb |first1=Nicholas |title=HSL Research Guides: Ernst Ludwig Wynder Autograph Collection: John Enders, Ph.D. |url=https://guides.library.nymc.edu/c.php?g=117959&p=767676 |website=guides.library.nymc.edu |publisher=New York Medical College Health Sciences Library |access-date=13 February 2021 |language=en |quote=In 1963, Pfizer introduced a deactivated measles vaccine, and Merck & Co introduced an attenuated measles vaccine.}}</ref>

He continued to work in virology research till the late 1970s and retired from the laboratory at the age of 80.<ref name="Ofgang2020"/><ref>Thomas H Weller & Frederick C Robb, ''[https://books.nap.edu/read/6061/chapter/5#60 A Biographical Memoir: John Franklin Enders (1897–1985)]'', (Washington DC: [[National Academy of Sciences]], 1991), p 60.</ref>
