He was the first to isolate a mammalian [[DNA ligase]] and to describe a totally unanticipated novel group of [[DNA glycosylase]]s as mediators of DNA excision repair. He has also discovered a unique class of enzymes in mammalian cells, namely the [[methyltransferase]]s, which mediate the adaptive response to [[alkylation]] of DNA and has shown that the expression of these enzymes is regulated by the ada gene. More recently he has elucidated the molecular defect in [[Bloom syndrome|Blooms syndrome]]{{sic}} to be the lack of DNA ligase I. Apart from providing profound insights into the nature of the DNA repair process his very important contributions promise to facilitate the design of more selective chemotherapeutic drugs for the treatment of cancer. Lindahl has also made a number of significant contributions to understanding at the DNA level the mechanism of transformation of [[B cell|B-lymphocytes]] by the [[Epstein–Barr virus|Epstein-Barr virus]]. The most notable of these was the first description of the occurrence in [[Lymphopoiesis|lymphoid cells]] of closed circular duplex viral DNA.<ref name=royal />}}
Lindahl received the [[Royal Society]]'s [[Royal Medal]] in 2007 "making fundamental contributions to our understanding of DNA repair. His achievements stand out for their great originality, breadth and lasting influence."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/page.asp?id=1750|title=Royal recent winners|access-date=2008-11-10}}</ref> He is a member of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnva.no/c26849/artikkel/vis.html?tid=40126|title=Gruppe 6: Cellebiologi og molekylærbiologi|publisher=[[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]]|language=no|access-date=2010-10-07}}</ref> He was awarded the [[Copley Medal]] in 2010. He was elected a founding [[Fellow of the Academy of Medical Sciences]] (FMedSci) in 1998. In 2018, he was elected a foreign associate of the [[National Academy of Sciences]].

He shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2015.<ref name=nyt /> The Swedish Academy noted that "The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2015 was awarded jointly to Tomas Lindahl, Paul Modrich and Aziz Sancar 'for mechanistic studies of DNA repair'."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2015/|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2015|work=nobelprize.org}}</ref>
