Modrich obtained a [[Scientiæ Baccalaureus|B.S.]] degree from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1968 and subsequently a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree from [[Stanford University]] in 1973. He continued his research as a postdoc in the lab of [[Charles C. Richardson]] at [[Harvard Medical School]] for a year (1973&ndash;1974).<ref name="NobelBio"/>

==Research==
Modrich became an assistant professor at the chemistry department of [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1974.<ref name="NobelBio"/> He joined Duke University's faculty in 1976 and has been a Howard Hughes Investigator since 1995. He works primarily on strand-directed mismatch repair. His lab demonstrated how DNA mismatch repair serves as a copyeditor to prevent errors from [[DNA]] polymerase. [[Matthew Meselson]] previously proposed the existence of recognition of mismatches. Modrich performed biochemical experiments to study mismatch repair in ''E. coli''.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Su|first1=SS|last2=Modrich|first2=P|title=Escherichia coli mutS-encoded protein binds to mismatched DNA base pairs.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=July 1986|volume=83|issue=14|pages=5057–61|pmid=3014530|doi=10.1073/pnas.83.14.5057|pmc=323889|bibcode=1986PNAS...83.5057S|doi-access=free}}</ref> They later searched for proteins associated with mismatch repair in humans.<ref name=HHMI/>
