==History of the discovery of HIV==

In 1982, [[Willy Rozenbaum]], a clinician at the ''[[Hôpital Bichat]]'' hospital in [[Paris]], asked Montagnier for assistance in establishing the cause of a mysterious new [[syndrome]], AIDS (known at the time as "[[gay-related immune deficiency]]" or GRID). Rozenbaum had suggested at scientific meetings that the cause of the disease might be a [[retrovirus]]. Montagnier and members of his group at the [[Pasteur Institute]], notably including [[Françoise Barré-Sinoussi]] and [[Jean-Claude Chermann]], had extensive experience with retroviruses. Montagnier and his team examined samples taken from Rozenbaum's AIDS patients and found the virus that would later become known as HIV in a [[lymph node]] [[biopsy]]. They named it "lymphadenopathy-associated virus", or LAV, since it was not then clear that it was the cause of AIDS, and published their findings in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' on 20 May 1983.<ref name="Science4599"/>

A team led by [[Robert Gallo]] of the United States published similar findings in the same issue of ''Science'' and later confirmed the discovery of the virus and presented evidence that it caused AIDS. Gallo called the virus "human T-lymphotropic virus type III" (HTLV-III) because of perceived similarities with HTLV-I and -II, which had previously been discovered in his lab.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Popovic M, Sarngadharan MG, Read E, Gallo RC|title=Detection, isolation, and continuous production of cytopathic retroviruses (HTLV-III) from patients with AIDS and pre-AIDS|journal=Science|volume=224|issue=4648|pages=497–500|year=1984|pmid=6200935|doi=10.1126/science.6200935|bibcode=1984Sci...224..497P }}</ref> Because of the timing of the discoveries, whether Montagnier's or Gallo's group was first to isolate HIV was for many years the subject of an acrimonious dispute. HIV isolates usually have a high degree of variability because the virus mutates rapidly. In comparison, the first two-human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) isolates, Lai/LAV (formerly LAV, isolated at the Pasteur Institute) and Lai/IIIB (formerly HTLV-IIIB, isolated from a pooled culture at the Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology (LTCB) of the [[National Cancer Institute]]) were strikingly similar in sequence, suggesting that the two isolates were in fact the same, or at least shared a common source.

In November 1990, the [[United States Office of Research Integrity|Office of Scientific Integrity]] at the [[National Institutes of Health]] attempted to clear up the matter by commissioning a group at [[Hoffmann–La Roche|Roche]] to analyze archival samples established at the Pasteur Institute and the Laboratory of Tumor Cell Biology (LTCB) of the National Cancer Institute between 1983 and 1985. The group, led by American epidemiologist Sheng-Yung Chang, examined archival specimens and concluded in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1993 that the American sample in fact originated from the French lab.

Chang determined that the French group's LAV was a virus from one patient that had contaminated a culture from another. On request, Montagnier's group had sent a sample of this culture to Gallo, not knowing it contained two viruses. It then contaminated the pooled culture on which Gallo was working.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Sheng-Yung P. Chang|author2=Barbara H. Bowman|author3=Judith B. Weiss|author4=Rebeca E.

Before the 1993 publication of Chang's results, Gallo's lab was accused and initially found guilty of "minor misconduct" by the Office of Scientific Integrity in 1991, and then by the newly created [[United States Office of Research Integrity|Office of Research Integrity]] in 1992 for the misappropriation of a sample of HIV produced at the Pasteur Institute.<ref name=sumf>{{cite web|url=http://ori.hhs.gov/education/products/unh_round1/www.unh.edu/rcr/Misconduct-FraudGoTo2.htm|title=Summary of fraud accusation|publisher=Ori.hhs.gov|access-date=15 May 2012}}</ref> The subsequent publication in 1993 of Chang's investigation cleared Gallo's lab of the charges, although his reputation had already been tainted by the accusations.

Today it is agreed that Montagnier's group first isolated HIV,<ref>{{cite web|last=Enserink|first=Martin|url=http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2008/1006/1|title=Nobel Prize Surprise – ScienceNOW|publisher=Sciencenow.sciencemag.org|access-date=15 May 2012}}</ref> but Gallo's group is credited with discovering that the virus causes AIDS and with generating much of the science that made the discovery possible, including a technique previously developed by Gallo's lab for growing [[T cell]]s in the laboratory.<ref name=Morgan76>{{cite journal|author1=DA Morgan|author2=FW Ruscetti|author3=R Gallo|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/193/4257/1007|title=Selective in vitro growth of T lymphocytes from normal human bone marrows|journal=Science|volume=193|issue=4257|pages=1007–1008|publisher=Sciencemag.org|date=10 September 1976|access-date=15 May 2012|doi=10.1126/science.181845|pmid=181845|bibcode=1976Sci...193.1007M}}</ref> When Montagnier's group first published their discovery, they said HIV's role in causing AIDS "remains to be determined."<ref name="science nobel">{{cite news|title=HIV, HPV Researchers Honored, But One Scientist is Left Out|work=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|date=October 2008|volume=322|pages=149–328}}</ref>

The question of whether the true discoverers of the virus were French or American was more than a matter of prestige. A US government patent for the AIDS test, filed by the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] and based on what was claimed to be Gallo's identification of the virus, was at stake. In 1987, both governments attempted to end the dispute by arranging to split the prestige of the discovery and the proceeds from the patent 50–50,<ref>{{cite news|last=Hilts|first=Philip|title=U.S. Drops Misconduct Case Against an AIDS Researcher|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=13 November 1993|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9F0CEFDB1F3BF930A25752C1A965958260}}</ref> naming Montagnier and Gallo co-discoverers.<ref name="science nobel"/> The two scientists continued to dispute each other's claims until 1987.

It was not until French President [[François Mitterrand]] and American President [[Ronald Reagan]] met in person that the major issues were ironed out. The scientific protagonists finally agreed to share credit for the discovery of HIV, and in 1986, both the French and the US names (LAV and HTLV-III) were dropped in favor of the new term ''human immunodeficiency virus'' (virus de l'immunodéficience humaine, abbreviated HIV or VIH) (Coffin, 1986). They concluded that the origin of the HIV-1 Lai/IIIB isolate discovered by Gallo was the same as that discovered by Montagnier (but not known by Montagnier to cause AIDS). This compromise allowed Montagnier and Gallo to end their feud and collaborate with each other again, writing a chronology that appeared in ''Nature'' that year.<ref name="science nobel"/>

On 29 November 2002 issue of ''Science'', Gallo and Montagnier published a series of articles, one of which was co-written by both scientists, in which they acknowledged the pivotal roles that each had played in the discovery of HIV.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Montagnier L|year=2002|title=Historical essay.

==Controversies==
===Electromagnetic signals from DNA===
{{Main|DNA teleportation}}
In 2009, Montagnier published two independently made, controversial research studies, one of which was entitled "Electromagnetic Signals Are Produced by Aqueous Nanostructures Derived from Bacterial DNA Sequences."  Jeff Reimers of the University of Sydney said that, if its conclusions are true, "these would be the most significant experiments performed in the past 90 years, demanding re-evaluation of the whole conceptual framework of modern chemistry".<ref name=Coghlan/> The paper concludes that diluted DNA from pathogenic bacterial and viral species is able to emit specific radio waves" and that "these radio waves [are] associated with 'nanostructures' in the solution that might be able to recreate the pathogen".

They were published in a new journal of which he is chairman of the editorial board,<ref name=ISCLS_board/> allegedly<ref name=Coghlan/> detecting [[Electromagnetic wave|electromagnetic signals]] from bacterial [[DNA]] (''M. pirum'' and ''E. coli'') in water that had been prepared using agitation and high dilutions,<ref name=Montagnier_2009_v1_n2>{{cite journal | last1=Montagnier | first1=Luc | last2=Aïssa | first2=Jamal | last3=Ferris | first3=Stéphane | last4=Montagnier | first4=Jean-Luc | last5=Lavalléee | first5=Claude | title=Electromagnetic signals are produced by aqueous nanostructures derived from bacterial DNA sequences | journal=Interdisciplinary Sciences: Computational Life Sciences | publisher=Springer Science and Business Media LLC | volume=1 | issue=2 | date=4 March 2009 | issn=1913-2751 | doi=10.1007/s12539-009-0036-7 | pages=81–90| pmid=20640822 | s2cid=7158953 }}</ref> and similar research on electromagnetic detection of HIV RNA in the blood of AIDS patients treated by [[antiretroviral therapy]].<ref name=Montagnier_2009_v1_n4>{{cite journal | last1=Montagnier | first1=Luc | last2=Aïssa | first2=Jamal | last3=Lavallée | first3=Claude | last4=Mbamy | first4=Mireille | last5=Varon | first5=Joseph | last6=Chenal | first6=Henri | title=Electromagnetic detection of HIV DNA in the blood of AIDS patients treated by antiretroviral therapy | journal=Interdisciplinary Sciences: Computational Life Sciences | publisher=Springer Science and Business Media LLC | volume=1 | issue=4 | date=14 November 2009 | issn=1913-2751 | doi=10.1007/s12539-009-0059-0 | pages=245–253| pmid=20640802 | s2cid=29991828 }}</ref>

===Homeopathy===
On 28 June 2010, Montagnier spoke at the [[Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting]] in Germany,<ref name=Lindau>{{cite web | title=Meeting Program | website=lindau-nobel.org | date=27 July 2011 | url=http://www.lindau-nobel.org/PublicMeetingProgram.AxCMS?Meeting=278 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727034143/http://www.lindau-nobel.org/PublicMeetingProgram.AxCMS?Meeting=278 | archive-date=27 July 2011 | url-status=dead | access-date=3 August 2021}}</ref> "where 60 Nobel prize winners had gathered, along with 700 other scientists, to discuss the latest breakthroughs in medicine, chemistry and physics."<ref name=Australian/> He "stunned his colleagues ... when he presented a new method for detecting viral infections that bore close parallels to the basic tenets of homeopathy. Although fellow Nobel prize winners – who view [[homeopathy]] as [[quackery]] – were left openly shaking their heads, Montagnier's comments were rapidly embraced by homeopaths eager for greater credibility. Cristal Sumner, of the [[British Homeopathic Association]], said Montagnier's work gave homeopathy 'a true scientific ethos'."<ref name=Australian>{{cite web | title=Nobel laureate gives homeopathy a boost - The Australian | website=theaustralian.com.au | date=25 December 2010 | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/health-science/nobel-laureate-gives-homeopathy-a-boost/story-e6frg8y6-1225887772305 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101225050453/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/health-science/nobel-laureate-gives-homeopathy-a-boost/story-e6frg8y6-1225887772305 | archive-date=25 December 2010 | url-status=dead | access-date=3 August 2021}}</ref>

When asked by Canada's CBC ''[[Marketplace (Canadian TV program)|Marketplace]]'' program if his work was indeed a theoretical basis for homeopathy as homeopaths had claimed, Montagnier replied that one "cannot extrapolate it to the products used in homeopathy".<ref name="cbc">{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/episodes/2011-episodes/cure-or-con |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413144840/http://www.cbc.ca/marketplace/episodes/2011-episodes/cure-or-con |title=Cure Or Con? |archive-date=13 April 2014 |publisher=CBC Marketplace }} Approx 17:00 of 22:29.</ref>

===Responses, criticisms and interviews===

The paper has met with harsh criticism for not being peer-reviewed, and its claims unsubstantiated by modern mainstream conventions of physics and chemistry. No third party has replicated the findings as of March 2015. In response to Montagnier's statement that the generally unfavorable response is due to the "non-understanding or misunderstanding of the breakthrough findings", blogger [[Andy Lewis (blogger)|Andy Lewis]] has written that he has found it difficult to assert what the paper "actually claims" and that "The paper [...] lacks any rigour. [...]", as "important experimental steps are described dismissively in a sentence and little attempt is made to describe the detail of the work".<ref name=AL>{{cite web |last=Lewis |first=Andy | title=Why I am Nominating Luc Montagnier for an IgNobel Prize – The Quackometer Blog | website=quackometer.net | url=http://www.quackometer.net/blog/2009/10/why-i-am-nominating-luc-montagnier-for.html | access-date=3 August 2021}}</ref>
While homeopaths claim his research as support for homeopathy, many scientists have greeted it with scorn and harsh criticism.<ref name=Coghlan/><ref name=PZ_Myers/><ref name=NS_editorial/>

In a 24 December 2010 ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' magazine interview entitled "French Nobelist Escapes ‘Intellectual Terror’ to Pursue Radical Ideas in China", he was questioned about his research and plans. In the interview he stated that [[Jacques Benveniste]], whose controversial [[homeopathy|homeopathic]] work had been discredited, was "a modern [[Galileo]]". When asked if he wasn't "worried that your colleagues will think you have drifted into pseudo-science?", he replied "No, because it’s not [[pseudoscience]]. It’s not [[quackery]]. These are real phenomena which deserve further study." He also mentioned that his applications for funding had been turned down and that he was leaving his home country to set up shop in China so he could escape what he called the "intellectual terror" which he claimed had prevented others from publishing their results. He says that China's [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]] is more "open minded" to his research. There he is chairman of the editorial board<ref name=ISCLS_board>{{cite web | title=Editors | website=Interdisciplinary Sciences: Computational Life Sciences | url=https://www.springer.com/life+sciences/bioinformatics/journal/12539?detailsPage=editorialBoard | access-date=3 August 2021}}</ref> of a new journal which publishes his research.<ref name=Enserink/>

Montagnier was also questioned on his beliefs about homeopathy, to which he replied: "I can’t say that homeopathy is right in everything. What I can say now is that the high dilutions are right. High dilutions of something are not nothing. They are water structures which mimic the original molecules. We find that with DNA, we cannot work at the extremely high dilutions used in homeopathy; we cannot go further than a 10<sup>−18</sup> dilution, or we lose the signal. But even at 10<sup>−18</sup>, you can calculate that there is not a single molecule of DNA left. And yet we detect a signal."<ref name=Enserink>{{cite journal | last=Enserink | first=M. | title=French Nobelist Escapes 'Intellectual Terror' to Pursue Radical Ideas in China | journal=Science | publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) | volume=330 | issue=6012 | date=23 December 2010 | issn=0036-8075 | doi=10.1126/science.330.6012.1732 | pages=1732| bibcode=2010Sci...330.1732E }} [https://www.scribd.com/doc/47426344/Luc-Montagnier-French-Nobelist-on-homeopathy Full article mirror]</ref>

A 12 January 2011 ''[[New Scientist]]'' editorial described the controversial nature of the research, while also noting how many researchers "reacted with disbelief", with [[Gary Schuster]] comparing it to "[[pathological science]]."<ref name=Coghlan/> biologist [[PZ Myers]] also described it as "pathological science." He described the paper as "one of the more unprofessional write-ups I've ever run across", and criticized the publication process as having an "unbelievable turnaround" time: "another suspicious sign are the dates. This paper was submitted on 3 January 2009, revised on 5 January 2009, and accepted on 6 January 2009", leading him to ask: "Who reviewed this, the author's mother? Maybe someone even closer. Guess who the chairman of the editorial board is: Luc Montagnier."<ref name=PZ_Myers/>

On 25 May 2012, he gave the keynote address<ref name=AO2012/> at the 2012 conference for AutismOne, an anti-vaccination group. Similar to the controversy he aroused by extolling homeopathy, his latest group, Chronimed, claims to have made a discovery for [[autistic]] children that was sharply criticized<ref name=Forbes/> by scientist [[Steven Salzberg]].

In 2017, 106 academic scientists wrote an open letter "calling [Montagnier] to order". The letter read: "We, academics of medicine, cannot accept that one of our peers is using his Nobel prize [status] to spread dangerous health messages outside of his field of knowledge."<ref name="Connexion">{{Cite web|last=France|first=Connexion|title=French Nobel prize winner: 'Covid-19 made in lab'|url=https://www.connexionfrance.com/French-news/Disputed-French-Nobel-winner-Luc-Montagnier-says-Covid-19-was-made-in-a-lab-laboratory|access-date=2021-05-25|website=www.connexionfrance.com|language=en}}</ref>

For his defense of such anti-scientific views, Montagnier has been cited as an example of the phenomenon called [[Nobel disease]].<ref name="LilienfeldSI">{{cite journal |last1=Basterfield |first1=Candice |last2=Lilienfeld |first2=Scott |author-link2=Scott Lilienfeld |last3=Bowes |first3=Shauna |last4=Costello |first4=Thomas |author-link4=Tom Costello (journalist) |title=The Nobel disease: When intelligence fails to protect against irrationality |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=2020 |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=32–37}}</ref><ref name="Gorski2">{{cite web |last1=Gorski |first1=David |author-link=David Gorski |title=Luc Montagnier and the Nobel Disease |url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/luc-montagnier-and-the-nobel-disease/ |website=Science Based Medicine |date=4 June 2012 |publisher=sciencebasedmedicine.org |access-date=13 May 2020}}</ref>

===COVID-19 pandemic===

In 2020, Montagnier argued that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2|SARS-CoV-2]], the virus that causes [[COVID-19]], was man-made in a laboratory and that it might have been the result of an attempt to create a vaccine for [[HIV/AIDS]]. His allegation came after the United States had launched a probe into whether the virus came from a laboratory. According to Montagnier, the "presence of elements of HIV and germ of [[malaria]] in the genome of coronavirus is highly suspect and the characteristics of the virus could not have arisen naturally."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Perez |first1=Jean Claude |last2=Montagnier |first2=Luc |title=COVID-19, SARS and Bats Coronaviruses Genomes Peculiar Homologous RNA Sequences |journal=International Journal of Research — Granthaalayah |date=1 August 2020 |volume=8 |issue=7 |pages=217–263 |doi=10.29121/granthaalayah.v8.i7.2020.678}}</ref>  Montagnier's conclusions were rejected as hasty by the scientific community, considering the gene sequences are common among similar organisms.<ref name=":0" /> There is no evidence indicating the novel coronavirus is a man-made virus.<ref name="Frutos"/><ref name="CellReview">{{cite journal |last1=Holmes |first1=Edward C. |last2=Goldstein |first2=Stephen A. |last3=Rasmussen |first3=Angela L. |last4=Robertson |first4=David L. |last5=Crits-Christoph |first5=Alexander |last6=Wertheim |first6=Joel O. |last7=Anthony |first7=Simon J. |last8=Barclay |first8=Wendy S. |last9=Boni |first9=Maciej F. |last10=Doherty |first10=Peter C. |last11=Farrar |first11=Jeremy |last12=Geoghegan |first12=Jemma L. |last13=Jiang |first13=Xiaowei |last14=Leibowitz |first14=Julian L. |last15=Neil |first15=Stuart J.D. |last16=Skern |first16=Tim |last17=Weiss |first17=Susan R. |last18=Worobey |first18=Michael |last19=Andersen |first19=Kristian G. |last20=Garry |first20=Robert F. |last21=Rambaut |first21=Andrew |title=The Origins of SARS-CoV-2: A Critical Review |journal=Cell |date=August 2021 |doi=10.1016/j.cell.2021.08.017 |pmid=34480864 |pmc=8373617 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867421009910 |doi-access=free}}</ref>
