'''Ronald George Wreyford Norrish''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]<ref name="frs"/> (9 November 1897 – 7 June 1978) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[chemist]] who was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1967.<ref>Norrish's [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1967/norrish-bio.html Nobel Foundation biography]</ref><ref>Norrish's  Nobel Lecture [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1967/norrish-lecture.pdf Some Fast Reactions in Gases Studied by Flash Photolysis and Kinetic Spectroscopy]</ref><ref>{{AcademicSearch|18047590}}</ref>

==Education and early life==
Norrish was born in [[Cambridge]] and was educated at [[The Perse School]] and [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]].<ref name="emmanuel">{{cite web | url=http://www.emma.cam.ac.uk/about/famous/index.cfm?id=12 | title=Ronald George Wreyford Norrish (1897 – 1978) | publisher=[[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]] | access-date=January 25, 2012}}</ref> He was a former student of [[Eric Rideal]].<ref name=frs/> From an early age he was interested in chemistry, walking up and down Cambridge University chemical laboratory admiring all the equipment His Father encouraged him to construct and equip a small laboratory in his garden shed in his garden and supplied all the chemicals he needed to conduct experiments.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Dainton|first=Frederick Sydney|last2=Thrush|first2=Brian Arthur|date=November 1981|title=Ronald George Wreyford Norrish, 9 November 1897 - 7 June 1978|url=https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbm.1981.0016|journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society|language=en|volume=27|pages=379–424|doi=10.1098/rsbm.1981.0016|issn=0080-4606}}</ref> This apparatus now forms part of the Science Museum collections - reference shows copper water tank <ref>{{Cite web|title=Copper water tank, from Ronald G.

==Career and research==
Norrish was a prisoner in [[World War I]] and later commented, with sadness, that many of his contemporaries and potential competitors at Cambridge had not survived the War. Military records show that 2nd Lieutenant Norrish of the Royal Artillery went missing (captured) in 21.3.18. 
Norrish rejoined Emmanuel College as a Research Fellow in 1925 and later became [[1920 Chair of Physical Chemistry|Head of the Department of Physical Chemistry]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. For many years, the Department of Physical Chemistry occupied the left-hand side of the [[Lensfield Road]] building with the other (and separate) department of 'Chemistry' (which encompassed organic, theoretical and inorganic chemistry) led by (Lord) [[Alexander R. Todd]] being accessed by turning right at the main entrance. Both departments had separate administrative, technical and academic personnel until they merged to form one chemistry department under [[John Meurig Thomas]] in the early 1980s. Norrish researched photochemistry using continuous light sources (including after the war, searchlights). 

The skill which Norrish displayed in his laboratory work problems marked him out amongst his contemporaries as an unusually gifted and energetic experimentalist, capable of making significant advances in photo-chemistry and gas kinetics. <ref name=":0" />

==Awards and honours==
Norrish was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1936|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1936]].<ref name=frs/> As a result of the development of [[flash photolysis]], Norrish was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1967 along with [[Manfred Eigen]] and [[George Porter]]<ref name="FlemingPhillips2004">{{cite journal|last1=Fleming|first1=G.

At Cambridge, Norrish supervised [[Rosalind Franklin]], future DNA researcher and colleague of [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]], and experienced some conflict with her.<ref>Rosalind Franklin: The Dark Lady of DNA. New York: HarperCollins, 2002. {{ISBN|0-06-018407-8}}, p. 72</ref>
