== Career ==
From 1980 to 1983 Gurnah lectured at [[Bayero University Kano]] in [[Nigeria]]. He then became a professor of English and postcolonial literature at the University of Kent, where he taught until his retirement<ref name="flood2021" /><ref name="altermarshall20211007">{{Cite news|last1=Alter|first1=Alexandra|last2=Marshall|first2=Alex|date=7 October 2021|title=Abdulrazak Gurnah Is Awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature|language=en-US|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/07/books/nobel-prize-literature-abdulrazak-gurnah.html|access-date=9 October 2021|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=7 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211007121712/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/07/books/nobel-prize-literature-abdulrazak-gurnah.html|url-status=live}}</ref> in 2017; he is now professor emeritus of English and postcolonial literatures at the university.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pri.org/stories/2021-10-07/nobel-prize-winner-abdulrazak-gurnah-introduction-man-and-his-writing|title=Nobel Prize winner Abdulrazak Gurnah: An introduction to the man and his writing|first=Lizzy|last=Attree|website=[[The World (radio program)|The World]]|date=7 October 2021|access-date=10 October 2021}}</ref> Although Gurnah's novels were received positively by critics, they were not commercially successful and in some cases were not published outside the United Kingdom.<ref name="alter2021">{{Cite news|last=Alter|first=Alexandra|date=2021-10-27|title=He Won the Nobel.

=== Writing ===
Alongside his work in academia Gurnah is a writer and novelist. He is the author of many short stories, essays and ten novels.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Simon|last2=Pawlak|first2=Justyna|date=2021-10-08|title=Tanzanian novelist Gurnah wins 2021 Nobel for depicting impact of colonialism, migration|language=en|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/tanzanian-writer-abdulrazak-gurnah-wins-2021-nobel-prize-literature-2021-10-07/|access-date=2021-10-11}}</ref> 

While his first language is [[Swahili language|Swahili]], he has used English as his literary language.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/a7c01a98-b9b0-42bd-ab9a-d3c2757db4cf|title=Abdulrazak Gurnah, winner of the Nobel Prize for literature|newspaper=[[Financial Times]]|first=David|last=Pilling|date=8 October 2021}}</ref> However Gurnah integrates bits of Swahili, Arabic and German into most of his writings. He has said that he had to push back against publishers to continue this practice and they would have preferred to "italicize or [[Anglicisation|Anglicize]] Swahili and Arabic references and phrases in his books".<ref name="altermarshall20211007"/> Gurnah has criticized the practices in both British and American publishing that want to "make the alien seem alien" by marking "foreign" terms and phrases with italics or by putting them in a glossary.<ref name="altermarshall20211007"/> As academic [[Hamid Dabashi]] notes, Gurnah "is integral to the manner in which Asian and African migratory and diasporic experiences have enriched and altered English language and literature. ... Calling authors like Gurnah diasporic, exilic, or any other such self-alienating term conceals the fact that English was native to him even before he set foot in England. English colonial officers had brought it home to him."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2021/10/12/this-one-for-africa-the-nobel-prize-ennobles-itself|title=This one for Africa: The Nobel Prize ennobles itself|website=[[Al Jazeera]]|first=Hamid|last=Dabashi|date=12 October 2021|access-date=2 November 2021}}</ref>

Gurnah began writing out of homesickness during his 20s. He started with writing down thoughts in his diary, which turned into longer reflections about home, and eventually grew into writing fictional stories about other people. This created a habit of using writing as a tool to understand and record his experience of being a refugee, living in another land and the feeling of being displaced. These initial stories eventually became Gurnah's first novel, ''[[Memory of Departure]]'' (1987), which he wrote alongside his Ph.D. dissertation. This first book set the stage for his ongoing exploration of the themes of "the lingering trauma of colonialism, war and displacement" throughout his subsequent novels, short stories and critical essays.<ref name="altermarshall20211007"/>

Consistent themes run through Gurnah's writing, including exile, displacement, belonging, colonialism and broken promises by the state. Most of his novels tell stories about people living in the developing world, affected by war or crisis, who may not be able to tell their own stories.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mengiste|first=Maaza|date=8 October 2021|title=Abdulrazak Gurnah: where to start with the Nobel prize winner|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/oct/08/abdulrazak-gurnah-where-to-start-with-the-nobel-prize-winner|url-status=live|access-date=9 October 2021|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en|archive-date=9 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211009090223/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2021/oct/08/abdulrazak-gurnah-where-to-start-with-the-nobel-prize-winner}}</ref><ref>Kaigai, Ezekiel Kimani (2014) [https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/37421643.pdf "Encountering Strange Lands: Migrant Texture in Abdulrazak Gurnah's Fiction"].

Much of Gurnah's work is set on the coast of [[East Africa]]{{sfn|Lavery|2013|p=118}} and all but one of his novels' [[protagonist]]s were born in Zanzibar.<ref name="bosman2021">{{Cite book|last=Bosman|first=Sean James|title=Rejection of Victimhood in Literature by Abdulrazak Gurnah, Viet Thanh Nguyen, and Luis Alberto Urrea|date=26 August 2021|publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]]|isbn=978-90-04-46900-6|pages=36–72|chapter=Abdulrazak Gurnah|doi=10.1163/9789004469006_003|s2cid=241357989}}</ref> Though Gurnah has not returned to live in Tanzania since he left at 18, he has said that his homeland "always asserts himself in his imagination, even when he deliberately tries to set his stories elsewhere."<ref name="altermarshall20211007"/>

Literary critic Bruce King posits that Gurnah's novels place East African protagonists in their broader international context, observing that in Gurnah's fiction "Africans have always been part of the larger, changing world".{{sfn|King|2006|p=86}} According to King, Gurnah's characters are often uprooted, alienated, unwanted and therefore are, or feel, resentful victims".{{sfn|King|2006|p=86}} Felicity Hand suggests that Gurnah's novels ''[[Admiring Silence]]'' (1996), ''[[By the Sea (novel)|By the Sea]]'' (2001) and ''[[Desertion (novel)|Desertion]]'' (2005) all concern "the alienation and loneliness that emigration can produce and the soul-searching questions it gives rise to about fragmented identities and the very meaning of 'home'."{{sfn|Hand|2012|p=39}} She observes that Gurnah's characters typically do not succeed abroad following their migration, using irony and humour to respond to their situation.{{sfn|Hand|2012|p=56}}

Novelist [[Maaza Mengiste]] has described Gurnah's works by saying: "He has written work that is absolutely unflinching and yet at the same time completely compassionate and full of heart for people of East Africa. [...] He is writing stories that are often quiet stories of people who aren’t heard, but there’s an insistence there that we listen."<ref name="altermarshall20211007" />

Aiming to build the readership for Gurnah's writing in Tanzania, the first translator of his novels into Swahili, academic Dr Ida Hadjivayanis of the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], has said: "I think if his work could be read in East Africa it would have such an impact. ... We can't change our reading culture overnight, so for him to be read the first steps would be to include Paradise and After Lives in the school curriculum."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-59178826|title=Why Tanzanian Nobel laureate Abdulrazak Gurnah is hardly known back home|publisher=BBC News|first=Priya|last=Sippy|access-date=8 November 2021}}</ref>
