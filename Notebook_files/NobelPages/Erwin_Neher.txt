'''Erwin Neher''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɛʁviːn ˈneːɐ|-|De-Erwin Neher.ogg}}; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|eɪ|ər}};<ref>[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/neher "Neher"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> born 20 March 1944) is a [[Germany|German]] [[biophysics|biophysicist]], specializing in the field of [[cell physiology]]. For significant contribution in the field, in 1991 he was awarded, along with [[Bert Sakmann]], the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for "their discoveries concerning the function of single [[ion channel]]s in cells".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1991/neher-autobio.html|title=Nobel autobiography of Neher}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://neurotree.org/neurotree/tree.php?pid=1206|title=Neurotree - Erwin Neher Family Tree|website=neurotree.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vega.org.uk/video/programme/40|title=Erwin Neher - Science Video Interview|first=Chris|last=Dean|website=Vega Science Trust}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Neher was born in [[Landsberg am Lech]], [[Upper Bavaria]], the son of Elisabeth (née Pfeiffer), a teacher, and Franz Xaver Neher, an executive at a dairy company.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1991/neher-bio.html | title=Erwin Neher – Biographical, The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1991 |work=nobelprize.org |publisher=Nobel Media AB|access-date=15 December 2019}}</ref> He studied physics at the [[Technical University of Munich]] from 1963 to 1966.

In 1966, he was awarded a [[Fulbright Scholarship]] to study in the US. He spent a year at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], and earned a master's degree in biophysics. While at the Charles Stevens Laboratory at [[Yale University]] for post-doctoral work he met fellow scientist [[Eva-Maria Neher]], whom he married in 1978 and subsequently the couple had five children – Richard, Benjamin, Carola, Sigmund, and Margret.{{Sfn|Schoenfeld|2006|p=264}}

In 2003 Neher was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the [[Humanism and Its Aspirations|Humanist Manifesto]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III/Notable_Signers |title=Notable Signers |publisher=American Humanist Association |work=Humanism and Its Aspirations |access-date=October 4, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005105825/http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III/Notable_Signers |archive-date=October 5, 2012 }}</ref>

==Career==
In 1986, he was awarded the [[Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize]] from [[Columbia University]] together with [[Bert Sakmann]]. In 1987, he received the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize]] of the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]], which is the highest honour awarded in German research.  Along with [[Bert Sakmann]], he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1991 for "their discoveries concerning the function of single [[ion channels]] in cells".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1991|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1991/|work=Nobelprize.org|access-date=16 May 2011}}</ref>  Neher and Sakmann were the first to record the currents of single ion channels on a live cell (they were first recorded using the lipid bilayer method) through their development of the [[patch-clamp technique]],<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Neher E, Sakmann B |title=The patch clamp technique |journal=Scientific American |volume=266 |issue=3 |pages=44–51 |date=March 1992 |pmid=1374932 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0392-44|bibcode=1992SciAm.266c..44N }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Neher E |title=Correction for liquid junction potentials in patch clamp experiments |volume=207 |pages=123–31 |year=1992 |pmid=1528115 |doi=10.1016/0076-6879(92)07008-C |series=Methods in Enzymology |isbn=978-0-12-182108-1|chapter=&#91;6&#93; Correction for liquid junction potentials in patch clamp experiments }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Neher E |title=The use of the patch clamp technique to study second messenger-mediated cellular events |journal=Neuroscience |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=727–34 |date=September 1988 |pmid=2462183 |doi=10.1016/0306-4522(88)90094-2|s2cid=45756434 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Neher E, Sakmann B, Steinbach JH |title=The extracellular patch clamp: a method for resolving currents through individual open channels in biological membranes |journal=Pflügers Archiv |volume=375 |issue=2 |pages=219–28 |date=July 1978 |pmid=567789 |doi=10.1007/BF00584247|s2cid=8035857 }}</ref> a project Neher began as a [[postdoctoral research]] associate in the laboratory of [[Charles F. Stevens]] at Yale.

Since 1983, he became a director at the [[Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry]] in [[Göttingen]] and led the Department for Membrane Biophysics. He turned into an emeritus director of the Institute since 2011. He is also a Professor Emeritus at the [[University of Göttingen]] and a co-chair of the Bernstein Center for Computational Neuroscience Göttingen{{when|date=May 2019}} .
