As reviewer Manjit Kumar puts it:
{{quote|As a student in 1954, Penrose was attending a conference in Amsterdam when by chance he came across an exhibition of Escher's work. Soon he was trying to conjure up impossible figures of his own and discovered the tribar – a triangle that looks like a real, solid three-dimensional object, but isn't. Together with his father, a physicist and mathematician, Penrose went on to design a [[Penrose stairs|staircase]] that simultaneously loops up and down. An article followed and a copy was sent to Escher. Completing a cyclical flow of creativity, the Dutch master of geometrical illusions was inspired to produce his two masterpieces.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/16/cycles-time-roger-penrose-review|title=Cycles of Time: An Extraordinary New View of the Universe by Roger Penrose – review|newspaper=The Guardian|date=15 October 2010|last1=Kumar|first1=Manjit|access-date=13 December 2016|archive-date=10 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110122217/https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/16/cycles-time-roger-penrose-review|url-status=live}}</ref>}}

Penrose spent the academic year 1956–57 as an assistant lecturer at [[Bedford College, London]] and was then  a research fellow at [[St John's College, Cambridge]]. During that three-year post, he married Joan Isabel Wedge, in 1959. Before the fellowship ended Penrose won a [[NATO]] Research Fellowship for 1959–61, first at [[Princeton]] and then at [[Syracuse University]]. Returning to the [[University of London]], Penrose spent two years, 1961–63, as a researcher at [[King's College, London]], before returning to the United States to spend the year 1963–64 as a visiting associate professor at the [[University of Texas at Austin]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Professor Sir Roger Penrose awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physics|url=https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/professor-sir-roger-penrose-awarded-the-2020-nobel-prize-in-physics|access-date=7 October 2020|website=King's College London|language=en-EN|archive-date=22 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201022121930/https://www.kcl.ac.uk/news/professor-sir-roger-penrose-awarded-the-2020-nobel-prize-in-physics|url-status=live}}</ref> He later held visiting positions at Yeshiva, Princeton and Cornell during 1966-67 and 1969.

One approach to this issue was by the use of [[perturbation theory]], as developed under the leadership of [[John Archibald Wheeler]] at Princeton.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ellis|first1=George F.

The importance of Penrose's epoch-making paper "Gravitational Collapse and Space-Time Singularities"<ref name=Penrose1965>{{cite journal|last1=Penrose|first1=Roger|title=Gravitational Collapse and Space-Time Singularities|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=January 1965|volume=14|issue=3|pages=57–59|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.14.57|bibcode = 1965PhRvL..14...57P }}</ref> was not its only result, summarised roughly as that if an object such as a dying star implodes beyond a certain point, then nothing can prevent the gravitational field getting so strong as to form some kind of singularity.

Following up his "weak [[cosmic censorship hypothesis]]", Penrose went on, in 1979, to formulate a stronger version called the "strong censorship hypothesis". Together with the [[BKL conjecture|Belinski–Khalatnikov–Lifshitz conjecture]] and issues of nonlinear stability, settling the censorship conjectures is one of the most important outstanding problems in [[general relativity]]. Also from 1979, dates Penrose's influential [[Weyl curvature hypothesis]] on the initial conditions of the observable part of the universe and the origin of the [[second law of thermodynamics]].<ref>{{cite conference | author = R.

Penrose is well known for his 1974 discovery of [[Penrose tiling]]s, which are formed from two tiles that can only [[tessellation|tile]] the plane nonperiodically, and are the first tilings to exhibit fivefold rotational symmetry. Penrose developed these ideas based on the article ''Deux types fondamentaux de distribution statistique''<ref>Jaromír Korčák (1938): Deux types fondamentaux de distribution statistique. Prague, Comité d'organisation, Bull. de l'Institute Int'l de Statistique, vol. 3, pp. 295–299.</ref> (1938; an English translation ''Two Basic Types of Statistical Distribution'') by Czech [[geographer]], [[demographer]] and statistician {{ill|Jaromír Korčák|cs}}.

In 1983, Penrose was invited to teach at [[Rice University]] in Houston, by the then provost Bill Gordon. He worked there from 1983 to 1987.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ricehistorycorner.com/2013/05/22/roger-penrose-at-rice-1983-87/|title=Roger Penrose at Rice, 1983–87|work=Rice History Corner|date=22 May 2013|access-date=29 January 2014|archive-date=17 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617233239/https://ricehistorycorner.com/2013/05/22/roger-penrose-at-rice-1983-87/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Later activity==
In 2004, Penrose released ''[[The Road to Reality: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe]]'', a 1,099-page comprehensive guide to the [[physical law|Laws of Physics]] that includes an explanation of his own theory.  The [[Penrose interpretation|Penrose Interpretation]] predicts the relationship between [[quantum mechanics]] and [[general relativity]], and proposes that a [[quantum state]] remains in [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] until the difference of [[space-time curvature]] attains a significant level.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/27/books/review/the-road-to-reality-a-really-long-history-of-time.html?_r=0 |title='The Road to Reality': A Really Long History of Time |first1=George |last1=Johnson |date=27 February 2005 |publisher=The New York Times, USA |access-date=3 April 2017 |archive-date=3 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210103115129/https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/27/books/review/the-road-to-reality-a-really-long-history-of-time.html?_r=0 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web  | title =If an Electron Can Be in Two Places at Once, Why Can't You?  | url =http://discovermagazine.com/2005/jun/cover/article_view?b_start:int=0&-C= | access-date = 27 October 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101130211/http://discovermagazine.com/2005/jun/cover/article_view?b_start:int=0&-C= | archive-date=1 November 2012}}</ref>

[[File:WMAP 2010.png|thumb|300px|[[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]] image of the (extremely tiny) anisotropies in the [[cosmic background radiation]]]]

In 2010, Penrose reported possible evidence, based on concentric circles found in [[WMAP|Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] data of the [[CMB|cosmic microwave background]] sky, of an earlier universe existing before the [[Big Bang]] of our own present universe.<ref name="Gurzadyan">{{cite arXiv |last1=Gurzadyan |first1=V.G. |last2=Penrose |first2=R. |title= Concentric circles in WMAP data may provide evidence of violent pre-Big-Bang activity". volume "v1 |date=2010 |eprint= 1011.3706 |class=astro-ph.CO}}</ref> He mentions this evidence in the epilogue of his 2010 book ''[[Cycles of Time]]'',<ref>Roger Penrose, ''Cycles of Time'', Vintage; Reprint edition (1 May 2012)</ref> a book in which he presents his reasons, to do with [[Einstein's field equations]], the [[Weyl curvature]] C, and the [[Weyl curvature hypothesis]] (WCH), that the transition at the Big Bang could have been smooth enough for a previous universe to survive it.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stoica|first=Ovidiu-Cristinel|date=November 2013|title=On the Weyl Curvature Hypothesis|journal=Annals of Physics|volume=338|pages=186–194|doi=10.1016/j.aop.2013.08.002|arxiv=1203.3382|bibcode=2013AnPhy.338..186S|s2cid=119329306}}</ref><ref>{{cite conference|author=R.

In simple terms, he believes that the singularity in [[Einstein's field equation]] at the Big Bang is only an apparent singularity, similar to the well-known apparent singularity at the [[event horizon]] of a [[black hole]].<ref name="Curiel 2020"/> The latter singularity can be removed by a change of [[coordinate system]], and Penrose proposes a different change of coordinate system that will remove the singularity at the big bang.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Penrose|first=Roger|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9XKYDwAAQBAJ&q=roger+penrose+%22change+of+coordinate%22&pg=PA55|title=Fashion, Faith, and Fantasy in the New Physics of the Universe|date=5 September 2017|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-17853-0|language=en|access-date=12 October 2020|archive-date=7 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211207185551/https://books.google.com/books?id=9XKYDwAAQBAJ&q=roger+penrose+%22change+of+coordinate%22&pg=PA55|url-status=live}}</ref> One implication of this is that the major events at the Big Bang can be understood without unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics, and therefore we are not necessarily constrained by the [[Wheeler–DeWitt equation]], which disrupts time.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kiefer|first=Claus|date=13 August 2013|title=Conceptual Problems in Quantum Gravity and Quantum Cosmology|journal=ISRN Mathematical Physics|volume=2013|pages=1–17|doi=10.1155/2013/509316|language=en|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{Cite arXiv |last=Vaas |first=Rüdiger |title=The Inverted Big-Bang <!-- unsupported parameter |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/0407071.pdf --> |year=2004 |eprint=physics/0407071}}</ref> Alternatively, one can use the Einstein–Maxwell–Dirac equations.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Finster |first1=F. |last2=Smoller |first2=J.A. |last3=Yau |first3=S.-T. |title=The Einstein-Dirac-Maxwell Equations – Black Hole Solutions |url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/403056/files/9910030.pdf |access-date=7 October 2020 |archive-date=7 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201007132312/https://cds.cern.ch/record/403056/files/9910030.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Physics and consciousness==
[[File:Roger Penrose 9671.JPG|thumb|Penrose at a conference]]
Penrose has written books on the connection between fundamental physics and human (or animal) consciousness. In ''[[The Emperor's New Mind]]'' (1989), he argues that known laws of physics are inadequate to explain the phenomenon of consciousness.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Ferris|first=Timothy|date=19 November 1989|title=HOW THE BRAIN WORKS, MAYBE (Published 1989)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/19/books/how-the-brain-works-maybe.html|access-date=7 October 2020|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=19 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211119091901/https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/19/books/how-the-brain-works-maybe.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Penrose proposes the characteristics this new physics may have and specifies the requirements for a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics (what he calls ''correct quantum gravity'').<ref>{{Cite web|last=Stork|first=David G.|date=29 October 1989|title=The Physicist Against the Hackers : THE EMPEROR'S NEW MIND: On Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics by Roger Penrose (Oxford University Press: $24.95; 428 pp.)|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-10-29-bk-90-story.html|access-date=7 October 2020|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|archive-date=7 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211207185551/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-10-29-bk-90-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Penrose uses a variant of [[Turing's halting theorem]] to demonstrate that a system can be [[deterministic]] without being [[algorithm]]ic.

Penrose believes that such deterministic yet non-algorithmic processes may come into play in the quantum mechanical [[Wave function collapse|wave function reduction]], and may be harnessed by the brain. He argues that computers today are unable to have intelligence because they are algorithmically deterministic systems. He argues against the viewpoint that the rational processes of the mind are completely algorithmic and can thus be duplicated by a sufficiently complex computer.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Penrose|first=Roger|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X28sDwAAQBAJ&q=G%C3%B6del's+incompleteness+theorem|title=The Emperor's New Mind: Concerning Computers, Minds, and the Laws of Physics|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-878492-0|language=en|access-date=7 December 2021|archive-date=19 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211119091917/https://books.google.com/books?id=X28sDwAAQBAJ&q=G%C3%B6del%27s+incompleteness+theorem|url-status=live}}</ref> This contrasts with supporters of [[computational theory of mind|strong artificial intelligence]], who contend that thought can be simulated algorithmically.

The [[Penrose–Lucas argument]] about the implications of Gödel's incompleteness theorem for computational theories of human intelligence has been widely criticised by mathematicians, computer scientists and philosophers, and the consensus among experts in these fields seems to be that the argument fails, though different authors may choose different aspects of the argument to attack.<ref>Criticism of the Lucas/Penrose argument that intelligence can not be entirely algorithmic:

Minsky maintained that "one can carry that quest [for scientific explanation] too far by only seeking new basic principles instead of attacking the real detail.

Penrose responded to criticism of ''The Emperor's New Mind'' with his follow up 1994 book ''[[Shadows of the Mind]]'', and in 1997 with ''[[The Large, the Small and the Human Mind]]''. In those works, he also combined his observations with those of anesthesiologist [[Stuart Hameroff]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Can Quantum Physics Explain Consciousness?

Penrose and Hameroff have argued that [[consciousness]] is the result of quantum gravity effects in [[microtubule]]s, which they dubbed [[Orch-OR]] (orchestrated objective reduction). [[Max Tegmark]], in a paper in ''Physical Review E'',<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tegmark | first1 = Max | date = 2000 | title = The importance of quantum decoherence in brain processes | journal = [[Physical Review E]] | volume = 61 | issue = 4| pages = 4194–4206 | doi=10.1103/physreve.61.4194| pmid = 11088215 |arxiv = quant-ph/9907009 |bibcode = 2000PhRvE..61.4194T | s2cid = 17140058 }}</ref> calculated that the time scale of neuron firing and excitations in microtubules is slower than the [[quantum decoherence|decoherence]] time by a factor of at least 10,000,000,000. The reception of the paper is summed up by this statement in Tegmark's support: "Physicists outside the fray, such as IBM's [[John A. Smolin]], say the calculations confirm what they had suspected all along. 'We're not working with a brain that's near absolute zero. It's reasonably unlikely that the brain evolved quantum behavior'".<ref name="Tetlow 2007 166">{{cite book

This involved superpositions of quanta separated by 24&nbsp;nm rather than the much smaller separations stipulated for Orch-OR. As a result, Hameroff's group claimed a decoherence time seven orders of magnitude greater than Tegmark's, but still well short of the 25&nbsp;ms required if the quantum processing in the theory was to be linked to the 40&nbsp;Hz gamma synchrony, as Orch-OR suggested. To bridge this gap, the group made a series of proposals.<ref name="Hagan2002" /> They supposed that the interiors of neurons could alternate between liquid and [[gel]] states. In the gel state, it was further hypothesized that the water electrical dipoles are oriented in the same direction, along the outer edge of the microtubule tubulin subunits.<ref name="Hagan2002" /> Hameroff et al. proposed that this ordered water could screen any quantum coherence within the tubulin of the microtubules from the environment of the rest of the brain. Each tubulin also has a tail extending out from the microtubules, which is negatively charged, and therefore attracts positively charged ions. It is suggested that this could provide further screening. Further to this, there was a suggestion that the microtubules could be pumped into a coherent state by biochemical energy.<ref name=":1" />[[File:Penrose in University of Santiago de Compostela to picked up the Fonseca prize.jpg|thumb|Penrose in the [[University of Santiago de Compostela]] to receive the [[Fonseca Prize]]]] Finally, he suggested that the configuration of the microtubule lattice might be suitable for quantum error correction, a means of holding together quantum coherence in the face of environmental interaction.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Hameroff|first1=Stuart|last2=Marcer|first2=P.|date=1998|title=Quantum Computation in Brain Microtubules?
