As a child, Imbens was an avid chess player.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Linders|first=Twan|last2=Broers|first2=Daphne|date=11 October 2020|title='Bedachtzame slimmerik' zat in Deurne op school en is nu winnaar van de Nobelprijs|url=https://www.ed.nl/de-peel/bedachtzame-slimmerik-zat-in-deurne-op-school-en-is-nu-winnaar-van-de-nobelprijs~ac1b7e11/?referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2F|url-status=live|access-date=11 October 2021|website=[[Eindhovens Dagblad]]}}</ref> In a 2021 interview, Imbens connected his passion for econometrics to his childhood interest in the game.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2021|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2021/imbens/interview/|access-date=11 October 2021|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US}}</ref>

Imbens graduated with a [[Candidate (degree)#The Netherlands and Belgium|Candidate's degree]] (equivalent to a Bachelor's degree) in Econometrics from [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]] in 1983. He subsequently obtained an [[Master of Science|MSc]] degree ''[[Latin honors|with distinction]]'' in Economics and Econometrics from the [[University of Hull]] in [[Kingston upon Hull]], UK in 1986.

In 1986, one of Imbens' mentors at the University of Hull, [[Tony Lancaster|Anthony Lancaster]], moved to [[Brown University]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. Imbens followed Lancaster to Brown to pursue further graduate and doctoral studies.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Irel|first=Corydon|last2=Office|first2=Harvard News|date=2007-03-15|title=Bringing hard science to economics|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2007/03/bringing-hard-science-to-economics/|access-date=2021-10-13|website=Harvard Gazette|language=en-US|archive-date=14 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210814054707/https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2007/03/bringing-hard-science-to-economics/|url-status=live}}</ref> Imbens received an [[Master of Arts|AM]] and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree, both in Economics, from Brown in 1989 and 1991, respectively.<ref name="thesis-imbens-1991">{{cite thesis |title=Two essays in econometrics |date=1991 |institution= Brown University |degree=Ph.D. |last=Imbens |first=Guido Wilhelmus |id={{ProQuest|303881903}} |oclc=26957442}}</ref><ref name="Imbens_Curriculum_Vitae" /><ref>{{cite web | title = Guido Imbens, 1991 Brown Ph.D. recipient, is 2016 – 17 Horace Mann Medal winner | url = https://economics.brown.edu/announcements/guido-imbens-1991-brown-phd-recipient-2016-17-horace-mann-medal-winner | website = Brown University Department of Economics website | date = 22 May 2017 | access-date = 11 October 2021}}</ref>

=== Econometrics and work on causal relationships ===
Working with fellow economists including [[Joshua Angrist]] and [[Alan Krueger]], Imbens focused on developing methodologies and frameworks that help economists use real-life situations, known as [[Natural experiment|natural experiments]], to test real life theories. Specifically, through his study he helped analyze [[causal relationships]]. Some of the problem statements analyzed through his study included the impact of college education or additional years of education on earnings.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Smialek|first=Jeanna|date=11 October 2021|title=The Nobel in economics goes to three who find experiments in real life.|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/11/business/nobel-economics-prize-david-card-joshua-angrist-guido-imbens.html|access-date=12 October 2021|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=11 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211011230730/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/11/business/nobel-economics-prize-david-card-joshua-angrist-guido-imbens.html|url-status=live}}</ref> His frameworks for causal relationships study found use in multiple other fields including social and biomedical sciences.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=Imbens|first=Guido W.|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/causal-inference-for-statistics-social-and-biomedical-sciences/71126BE90C58F1A431FE9B2DD07938AB|title=Causal Inference for Statistics, Social, and Biomedical Sciences: An Introduction|last2=Rubin|first2=Donald B.|date=2015|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-88588-1|location=Cambridge|access-date=12 October 2021|archive-date=11 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211011235900/https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/causal-inference-for-statistics-social-and-biomedical-sciences/71126BE90C58F1A431FE9B2DD07938AB|url-status=live}}</ref> His work has provided researchers across disciplines with tools to understand the limitation of real-world experiments improving their ability to better understand the effects of field and experimental data based interventions. The methodologies have been useful for researchers to analyze research problems as diverse as studying the impact of new regulations on economic activity and on new drug effectiveness on patients.<ref name=":0" />

In one of his earliest collaborations with Angrist, Imbens introduced a model called [[Local average treatment effect|Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE)]] that helped researches to draw [[causal inference]] from observational data. Elaborating on the model in a ''[[Econometrica]]'' paper in 1994 titled "Identification and Estimation of Local Average Treatment Effects", the pair employed the idea of [[natural experiment]]s, which were real world events and situations as against controlled conditions to study the effects of key changes. In doing so, the pair took advantage of the role chance and randomization that naturally occurred in the real world rather than controlled simulations, which could be expensive, time-consuming, or even unethical.<ref>{{Cite book|last=D.|first=Angrist, Joshua|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1144555780|title=Identification and Estimation of Local Average Treatment Effects|oclc=1144555780}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|last=University|first=Stanford|date=11 October 2021|title=Guido Imbens wins Nobel in economic sciences|url=https://news.stanford.edu/2021/10/11/guido-imbens-wins-nobel-economic-sciences/|access-date=12 October 2021|website=Stanford News|language=en|archive-date=12 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211012020814/https://news.stanford.edu/2021/10/11/guido-imbens-wins-nobel-economic-sciences/|url-status=live}}</ref> The paper and the model had significant impact on other research efforts across econometrics, statistics and other fields.<ref name=":2" />

In one of the real-world applications of the model that would have implications for policymakers, Imben partnered with statistician [[Donald Rubin]] and economist [[Bruce Sacerdote]] to study the impact of unearned earnings on labor supply. The group studied the implications of policy interventions such as [[Universal basic income|Universal Basic Income]] or other federal and state wage assistance programs on citizens' willingness to participate in the labor force and the eventual impact on labor supply.

To devise a natural experiment, the group studied the winners of the [[Massachusetts Lottery|Massachusetts state lottery]] where the winners were paid incrementally over many years as opposed to a lump-sum payment. In doing so, the group was able to study the causal effects of guaranteed income. The group found that while there was some impact on labor supply, it did not change how much people worked by much.

Specifically, they found that lottery participants who won $1.6 million (in the form of $80,000 a year for 20 years) reduced their working hours, on average, by between 4 and 9 hours per week. On the other hand, winning $300,000 (in the form of $15,000 a year for 20 years) did not significantly affect hours worked. Winners worked slightly longer hours than non-winners by an amount not significantly different from zero. For the subset of lottery participants who were unemployed the year before they won, winners worked more than non-winners in each of the six years after winning, to an extent that was statistically significant in three of the six years.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Imbens|first=Guido W.|last2=Rubin|first2=Donald B.|last3=Sacerdote|first3=Bruce I.|date=1 September 2001|title=Estimating the Effect of Unearned Income on Labor Earnings, Savings, and Consumption: Evidence from a Survey of Lottery Players|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.4.778|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=91|issue=4|pages=778–794|doi=10.1257/aer.91.4.778|issn=0002-8282|access-date=14 October 2021|archive-date=4 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210504115141/https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257%2Faer.91.4.778|url-status=live}}</ref>

Some of his work was summarized in a book co-written with American statistician [[Donald Rubin|Donald B. Rubin]], ''Causal Inference for Statistics, Social, and Biomedical Sciences.<ref name=":1" />''

More recently, he (along with Prof. Susan Athey) has been working on using machine learning methods, particularly modifications to random forests called causal forests<ref>{{cite web |title=Causal Tree R package; Authors -- Susan Athey, Guido Imbens, Yangyang Kong & Vikas Ramachandra  |url=https://github.com/susanathey/causalTree/blob/master/doc/briefintro.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Recursive partitioning for heterogeneous causal effects; Authors -- Susan Athey and Guido Imbens |url=https://www.pnas.org/content/113/27/7353.short |access-date=13 October 2021 |archive-date=29 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210729101951/https://www.pnas.org/content/113/27/7353.short |url-status=live }}}</ref> to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects in causal inference models.
