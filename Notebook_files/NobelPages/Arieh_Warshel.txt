==Biography==
Warshel was born to a [[Jews|Jewish]] family in 1940 in [[kibbutz]] [[Sde Nahum]], [[Mandatory Palestine]]. Warshel served in the Israeli Armored Corps. After serving the Israeli Army (final rank [[Captain (armed forces)|Captain]]), Warshel attended the [[Technion]], Haifa, where he received his BSc degree in chemistry, Summa Cum Laude, in 1966. Subsequently, he earned both MSc and PhD degrees in Chemical Physics (in 1967 and 1969,  respectively), with Shneior Lifson at [[Weizmann Institute of Science]], Israel.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} After his PhD, he did postdoctoral work at [[Harvard University]] until 1972, and from 1972 to 1976 he returned to the Weizmann Institute and worked for the [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]], Cambridge, England. After being denied tenure by Weizmann Institute in 1976,<ref>[https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4438751,00.html Nobel laureate: We left because Warshel didn't get tenure in Israel] by Yitzhak Benhorin, October 9, 2013, [[YNET]]</ref> he joined the faculty of the Department of Chemistry at USC. He was awarded the 2013 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].

As a soldier, he fought in both the 1967 [[Six-Day War]] and the [[1973 Yom Kippur War]], attaining the rank of captain in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]].<ref>[http://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-prof-arieh-warshel-shares-2013-nobel-prize-in-chemistry 3 Jewish professors — two of them Israeli — share 2013 Nobel Prize in chemistry] By Gavriel Fiske, October 9, 2013, [[Times of Israel]]</ref>
