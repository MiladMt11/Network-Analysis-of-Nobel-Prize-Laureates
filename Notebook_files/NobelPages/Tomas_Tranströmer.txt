==Life and work==

===Early life===
Tranströmer was born in [[Stockholm]] in 1931 and raised by his mother Helmy, a schoolteacher, following her divorce from his father, Gösta Tranströmer, an editor.<ref name="ap nobel"/><ref name="guardian">{{cite news |title=Nobel prize for literature goes to Tomas Tranströmer |first1=Richard |last1=Lea |first2=Alison |last2=Flood |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/06/nobel-prize-literature-tomas-transtromer?newsfeed=true |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=6 October 2011 |access-date=6 October 2011}}</ref> He received his secondary education at the [[Södra Latin]] [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] in Stockholm, where he began writing poetry. In addition to selected journal publications, his first collection of poems, ''[[17 Poems]]'', was published in 1954. He continued his education at [[Stockholm University]], graduating as a psychologist in 1956 with additional studies in history, religion and literature.<ref name="wp nobel">{{cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/swedish-poet-tomas-transtromer-wins-nobel-literature-prize/2011/10/06/gIQAJ9YiPL_story.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111006154906/http://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/books/swedish-poet-tomas-transtromer-wins-nobel-literature-prize/2011/10/06/gIQAJ9YiPL_story.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 6 October 2011 | title = Swedish poet Tomas Transtromer wins Nobel literature prize for 'condensed, translucent' works | agency = Associated Press | date =6 October 2011 | access-date  = 6 October 2011 }}</ref> Between 1960 and 1966, Tranströmer split his time between working as a psychologist at the Roxtuna center for juvenile offenders and writing poetry.<ref name="ap nobel"/>

===Poetry===
Tranströmer is considered to be one of the "most influential Scandinavian poet[s] of recent decades".<ref name="ap nobel"/> Tranströmer published 15 collected works over his extensive career, which have been translated into over 60 languages.<ref name="ap nobel"/> An English translation by [[Robin Fulton]] of his entire body of work, ''New Collected Poems'', was published in the UK in 1987 and expanded in 1997. Following the publication of ''The Great Enigma'', Fulton's edition was further expanded into ''The Great Enigma: New Collected Poems,'' published in the US in 2006 and as an updated edition of ''New Collected Poems''<ref>{{cite news |title=New Collected Poems by Tomas Tranströmer – review |first=Paul |last=Batchelor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/17/new-collected-poems-tomas-transtromer-review |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 June 2011 |access-date=6 October 2011}}</ref> in the UK in 2011. He published a short autobiography, ''Minnena ser mig'' ''(The Memories see me)'', in 1993.

By the mid-1960s, Tranströmer became close friends with poet [[Robert Bly]]. The two corresponded frequently, and Bly would translate Tranströmer's poems into English. In 2001 [[Bonnier Group|Bonniers]], Tranströmer's publisher, released ''Air Mail'', a work consisting of Tranströmer's and Bly's day-to-day correspondence on personal, contemporary and literary matters c. 1965–1991 – in a style that vividly conveyed how close friends the two had soon become.<ref name="ap nobel"/> Bly also helped arrange readings for his fellow poet in America. The Syrian poet [[Adunis]] helped spread Tranströmer's fame in the [[Arab world]], accompanying him on reading tours.<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://english.ahram.org.eg/~/NewsContentP/18/23495/Books/Adonis-Transtromer-is-deeply-rooted-in-the-land-of.aspx | title = Adonis: Transtromer is deeply rooted in the land of poetry | work = [[Al-Ahram]] | date =6 October 2011 | access-date = 6 October 2011 }}</ref>

[[File:Tomas Transtromer and Modhir Ahmed.jpg|thumb|right|Tranströmer (right) with Iraqi-Swedish artist [[Modhir Ahmed]], 2007]]

In the 1970s, other poets accused Tranströmer of being detached from his own age, since he did not deal overtly with social and political issues in his poems and novels. His work, though, lies within and further develops the [[Modernist]] and [[Expressionist]]/[[Surrealist]] language of 20th-century poetry; his clear, seemingly simple pictures from everyday life and nature in particular reveals a mystic insight to the universal aspects of the human mind. A poem of his was read at [[Anna Lindh]]'s memorial service in 2003.<ref name="bbc nobel"/>

Tranströmer went to [[Bhopal]] immediately after the [[Bhopal disaster|gas tragedy]] in 1984, and alongside Indian poets such as [[K. Satchidanandan]], took part in a poetry reading session outside the plant.<ref>{{Cite news | url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-10-07/india/30257336_1_swedish-poet-tomas-transtromer-nobel-laureate-nobel-prize | archive-url = https://archive.today/20120714191026/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-10-07/india/30257336_1_swedish-poet-tomas-transtromer-nobel-laureate-nobel-prize | url-status = dead | archive-date = 14 July 2012 | title = Nobel laureate has an India connection | work = [[The Times of India]] | date =7 October 2011 | access-date = 7 October 2011 }}</ref>

Tranströmer suffered a [[stroke]] in 1990 that left him partially paralyzed and unable to speak; however, he continued to write and publish poetry through the early 2000s. One of his final original volumes of poetry, ''Den stora gåtan'', was published in 2004, translated into English in 2006 as ''[[The Great Enigma]]''.

===Music===
Tranströmer played the piano throughout his life; after his stroke, which paralyzed the right side of his body, he taught himself to play only with his left hand. He often said that the playing was a way for him to continue living after the stroke.<ref name="guardian"/><ref>[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/harriet/2011/11/tomas-transtromer-plays-piano-in-new-short-doc-on-new-official-website/ Poetry Foundation "Tomas Tranströmer Plays Piano in New Short Doc on New Official Website" 1 November 2011]</ref><ref>http://tomastranstromer.net/music/audio/</ref><ref>[[Jean-Pierre Thiollet]], ''88 notes pour piano solo'', Neva Editions, 2015, p.154-155. {{ISBN|978-2-3505-5192-0}}</ref>

Tranströmer's daughter Emma is a concert singer. In 2011 she released the album ''Dagsmeja'', containing songs based on Tranströmer's poems.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tomas Tranströmer : från vaggan till priset |newspaper= Dagens Nyheter |date=7 October 2011 |pages= 66–67}}</ref>

Many composers and musicians have worked with his poems. Among these are [[Jan Garbarek]], [[Ulf Grahn]], [[Madeleine Isaksson]], [[Margareta Hallin]], [[Lars Edlund]], [[Sven-David Sandström]], [[Jan Sandström (composer)|Jan Sandström]] and [[Anders Eliasson]].<ref>[https://www.svenskmusik.org/en/search?search-text=Transtr%C3%B6mer Swedish Music Information Centre]</ref>

===Death===
Tranströmer died in Stockholm on 26 March 2015 at 83, less than 3 weeks before his 84th birthday.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Brown|first1=Andrew|title=Swedish Nobel laureate Tomas Tranströmer dies aged 83|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/27/swedish-poet-thomas-transtromer-dies-age-83|access-date=28 March 2015|work=The Guardian|date=26 March 2015}}</ref>
