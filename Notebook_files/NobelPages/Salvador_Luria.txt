'''Salvador Edward Luria''' (August 13, 1912 – February 6, 1991) was an Italian [[microbiology|microbiologist]], later a [[Naturalized citizen of the United States#Naturalization|naturalized U.S. citizen]]. He won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1969, with [[Max Delbrück]] and [[Alfred Hershey]], for their discoveries on the replication mechanism and the genetic structure of viruses. Salvador Luria also showed that bacterial resistance to viruses ([[phage]]s) is genetically inherited.

==Biography==
Luria was born Salvatore Edoardo Luria in [[Turin]], Italy to an influential Italian [[Sephardi Jew]]ish family. His parents were Davide and Ester (Sacerdote) Luria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.directessays.com/viewpaper/78978.html|title=FREE Essay on The Life of Salvador Luria|website=www.directessays.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015183907/http://www.directessays.com/viewpaper/78978.html|archive-date=2013-10-15}}</ref> He attended the medical school at the  [[University of Turin]] studying with [[Giuseppe Levi]]. There, he met two other future [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureates: [[Rita Levi-Montalcini]] and [[Renato Dulbecco]]. He graduated from the [[University of Turin]] in 1935 and never got a master's degree or a PhD as they were not contemplated by the Italian high educational system (which, on the other hand, was very selective). From 1936 to 1937, Luria served his required time in the Italian army as a medical officer. He then took classes in [[radiology]] at the [[University of Rome La Sapienza|University of Rome]]. Here, he was introduced to [[Max Delbrück]]'s theories on the [[gene]] as a molecule and began to formulate methods for testing genetic theory with the [[bacteriophages]], [[virus]]es that infect [[bacteria]].

In 1938, he received a fellowship to study in the United States, where he intended to work with Delbrück. Soon after Luria received the award, [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[fascism|fascist]] regime banned Jews from academic research fellowships. Without funding sources for work in the U.S. or Italy, Luria left his home country for Paris, France in 1938. As the [[Nazism|Nazi]] German armies invaded France in 1940, Luria fled on bicycle to [[Marseille]] where he received an immigration [[Visa (document)|visa]] to the United States.

==Phage research==

Luria arrived in New York City on September 12, 1940, and soon changed his first and middle names. With the help of physicist [[Enrico Fermi]], whom he knew from his time at the University of Rome, Luria received a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] fellowship at [[Columbia University]]. He soon met Delbrück and Hershey, and they collaborated on experiments at [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] and in Delbrück's lab at [[Vanderbilt University]].

His famous experiment with Delbrück in 1943,<ref>Luria SE, Delbrück M. Mutations of bacteria from virus sensitivity to virus resistance. Genetics. 1943 Nov;28(6):491-511. doi: 10.1093/genetics/28.6.491. PMID: 17247100; PMCID: PMC1209226</ref><ref>Luria SE "Mutations of bacteria and bacteriophage" in Phage and the Origins of Molecular Biology (2007) Edited by John Cairns, Gunther S. Stent, and James D. Watson, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory of Quantitative Biology, Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island, New York, pgs. 173-179. ISBN 978-0879698003</ref> known as the [[Luria–Delbrück experiment]], demonstrated statistically that inheritance in bacteria must follow [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]ian rather than [[Lamarckism|Lamarckian]] principles and that [[mutant]] bacteria occurring randomly can still bestow viral resistance without the virus being present. The idea that natural selection affects bacteria has profound consequences, for example, it explains how bacteria develop [[antibiotic]] resistance.

From 1943 to 1950, he worked at [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]]. His first graduate student was [[James D. Watson]], who went on to discover the structure of [[DNA]] with [[Francis Crick]]. In January 1947, Luria became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States.

In 1950, Luria moved to the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]]. In the early 1950s, Luria and Giuseppe Bertani discovered the phenomenon of [[Restriction modification system|host-controlled restriction]] and modification of a bacterial virus: a culture of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' can significantly reduce the production of phages grown in other strains; however, once the phage become established in that strain, they also become  restricted in their ability to grow in other strains.<ref name="Luria_Human_1952">{{cite journal | vauthors = Luria SE, Human ML | title = A nonhereditary, host-induced variation of bacterial viruses | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 64 | issue = 4 | pages = 557–69 | date = Oct 1952 | pmid = 12999684 | pmc = 169391 | doi = 10.1128/JB.64.4.557-569.1952 }}</ref><ref name="pmid13034700">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bertani G, Weigle JJ | title = Host controlled variation in bacterial viruses | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 65 | issue = 2 | pages = 113–21 | date = Feb 1953 | pmid = 13034700 | pmc = 169650 | doi = 10.1128/JB.65.2.113-121.1953 }}</ref>  It was later discovered by other researchers that bacteria produce [[enzyme]]s that cut viral DNA at particular sequences but not the bacteria's own DNA, which is protected by [[DNA methylation|methylation]].  These enzymes became known as [[restriction enzyme]]s and developed into one of the main molecular tools in [[molecular biology]].<ref name="pmid15840723">{{cite journal | author = Roberts RJ | title = How restriction enzymes became the workhorses of molecular biology | journal = Proc.

==Later work==

In 1959, he became chair of Microbiology at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT). At MIT, he switched his research focus from phages to [[cell membrane]]s and [[bacteriocin]]s.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} While on sabbatical in 1963 to study at the [[Institut Pasteur]] in Paris, he found that bacteriocins impair the function of cell membranes. Returning to MIT, his lab discovered that bacteriocins achieve this impairment by forming holes in the cell membrane, allowing [[ion]]s to flow through and destroy the [[electrochemical gradient]] of cells. In 1972, he became chair of The [[David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research|Center for Cancer Research]] at MIT.  The department he established included future Nobel Prize winners [[David Baltimore]], [[Susumu Tonegawa]], [[Phillip Allen Sharp]] and [[H. Robert Horvitz]].

In addition to the Nobel Prize, Luria received a number of awards and recognitions. He was named a member of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1960. From 1968 to 1969, he served as president of the [[American Society for Microbiology]]. In 1969, he was awarded the [[Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize]] from [[Columbia University]] together with [[Max Delbrück]], co-winner with Luria of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1969. In the U.S. he won the 1974 [[National Book Award]] [[List of winners of the National Book Award#Science, Philosophy and Religion|in Science]] for his [[popular science]] book ''Life: the Unfinished Experiment''<ref name=nba1974>

==Political activism==

Throughout his career, Luria was an outspoken political advocate.<ref>Luria SE. A Slot Machine, a Broken Test Tube.  An Autobiography. Chapter 9.  “In the political arena” pgs. 166-207, Harper and Row, New York, 1984. Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Series</ref> He joined with [[Linus Pauling]] in 1957 to protest against nuclear weapon testing.  Luria was an opponent of the [[Vietnam War]] and a supporter of [[organized labor]]. In the 1970s, he was involved in debates over [[genetic engineering]], advocating a compromise position of moderate oversight and regulation rather than the extremes of a complete ban or full scientific freedom. Due to his political involvement, he was [[blacklisted]] from receiving funding from the [[National Institutes of Health]] for a short time in 1969.

He was a friend of the noted linguist and political activist [[Noam Chomsky]], and communicated with the Jewish American writer [[Elie Wiesel]] through a letter, in which he criticized Israel's involvement in the [[Guatemalan genocide]] and satirically Wiesel's silence on any issue concerning Israel's alleged terrorist activities worldwide. Chomsky would later describe it as such: "In the mid-1980s, Salvador Luria, a friend of mine who is a Nobel laureate in biology and politically active, knew about this [i.e., the genocide]. It wasn't a big secret. He asked me to collect articles from the Hebrew press which described Israel's participation in genocidal attacks in Guatemala – not just participation, it's a leadership role – because he wanted to send it to Elie Wiesel with a polite letter saying: as a fellow Nobel laureate, I would like to bring this to your attention. Could you use your influence – he didn't ask him to say anything, that's too much, but privately could you communicate to the people you know well at a high level in Israel and say it's not nice to take part in genocide. He never got a response."<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://chomsky.info/201502__/ | title=The World of Our Grandchildren: Noam Chomsky discusses ISIS, Israel, climate change, and the kind of world future generations may inherit &#124; Noam Chomsky interviewed by David Barsamian}}</ref>

He died in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]] of a heart attack.
