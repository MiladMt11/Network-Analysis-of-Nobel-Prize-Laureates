==Background==
Anfinsen was born in [[Monessen, Pennsylvania]], into a family of [[Norwegian American]] immigrants. His parents were Sophie (née Rasmussen) and Christian Boehmer Anfinsen Sr., a mechanical engineer. The family moved to Philadelphia in the 1920s. In 1933, he went to [[Swarthmore College]] where he played varsity football and earned a bachelor's degree in chemistry in 1937.<ref name="BioNIH & Encyclopedia.com"/>

In 1939, he earned a [[master's degree]] in organic chemistry from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and was awarded an [[American-Scandinavian Foundation]] fellowship to develop new methods for analyzing the chemical structure of complex proteins, namely [[enzymes]], at the [[Carlsberg Laboratory]] in [[Copenhagen, Denmark]]. In 1941, Anfinsen was offered a university fellowship for doctoral study in the Department of Biological Chemistry at [[Harvard Medical School]] where he received his [[Ph.D.]] in biochemistry in 1943.<ref name="BioNIH & Encyclopedia.com"/> During [[World War II]] he worked for the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/16/obituaries/christian-b-anfinsen-nobel-winner-in-chemistry-dies-at-79.html|title=Christian B.

Anfinsen had three children with his first wife, Florence Kenenger, to whom he was married from 1941 to 1978. In 1979, he married Libby Shulman Ely, with whom he had 4 stepchildren,<ref name="JH & Independent">

His papers were donated to the National Library of Medicine by Libby Anfinsen between 1998 and 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/anfinsen|title=Christian Anfinsen Papers 1939-1999 (bulk 1964-1999)|publisher= National Library of Medicine}}</ref>

==Career==
[[File:Christian B. AnfinsenNIH.jpg|left|thumb|Anfinsen in the lab]]
In 1950, the [[National Heart Institute]], part of the [[National Institutes of Health]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], recruited Anfinsen as chief of its laboratory of [[cell physiology]]. In 1954, a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] fellowship enabled Anfinsen to return to the Carlsberg Laboratory for a year and a [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]] fellowship allowed him to study at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]] in [[Rehovot, Israel]] from 1958 to 1959.<ref>[http://www.gf.org/fellows/360-christian-b-anfinsen "Christian B. Anfinsen – 1957"(Guggenheim Foundation)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622012557/http://www.gf.org/fellows/360-christian-b-anfinsen |date=June 22, 2011 }}. Gf.org. Retrieved on 2012-03-08.</ref> He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1958.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=18 April 2011}}</ref><ref name="BioNIH & Encyclopedia.com"/>

In 1962, Anfinsen returned to Harvard Medical School as a visiting professor and was invited to become chair of the department of chemistry.  He was subsequently appointed chief of the laboratory of chemical biology at the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases (now the National Institute of Arthritis, Diabetes, and Digestive and Kidney Diseases), where he remained until 1981.<ref name="BioNIH & Encyclopedia.com"/> In 1981, Anfinsen became a founding member of the [[World Cultural Council]].<ref>{{cite web | title = About Us | publisher = [[World Cultural Council]] | url = http://www.consejoculturalmundial.org/about-us/ | access-date = November 8, 2016}}</ref> From 1982 until his death in 1995, Anfinsen was Professor of Biology and (Physical) Biochemistry at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]].<ref name="BioNIH & Encyclopedia.com"/><ref name="JH & Independent"/>

[[Image:RibonucleaseA SS line.png|thumb|right| Ribonuclease A 3D structure, with SS bonds in gold]]
Anfinsen published more than 200 original articles, mostly in the area of the relationships between structure and function in proteins, as well as a book, The Molecular Basis of Evolution (1959), in which he described the relationships between protein chemistry and genetics and the promise those areas held for the understanding of evolution.<ref name="JH & Independent"/> He was also a pioneer of ideas in the area of nucleic acid compaction. In 1961, he showed that [[ribonuclease]] could be refolded after denaturation while preserving enzyme activity, thereby suggesting that all the information required by protein to adopt its final conformation is encoded in its [[primary structure|amino-acid sequence]]. He belonged to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (USA), the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]] and the [[American Philosophical Society]].<ref name="BioNIH & Encyclopedia.com"/><ref name="JH & Independent"/>

==Christian B. Anfinsen Award==

Established in 1996, The Christian B. Anfinsen Award is presented annually to distinguished scientists, the Awards recognize excellence and outstanding achievements in the multidisciplinary fields of protein science, and honor distinguished contributions in the areas of leadership, education, or service.  It is sponsored by The Protein Society, and recognizes significant technical achievements in the field of protein science.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.proteinsociety.org/protein-society-awards/the-christian-b-anfinsen-award/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319204845/http://www.proteinsociety.org/protein-society-awards/the-christian-b-anfinsen-award/|url-status=dead|title=THE CHRISTIAN B.
