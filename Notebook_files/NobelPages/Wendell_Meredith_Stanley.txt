'''Wendell Meredith Stanley''' (16 August 1904 – 15 June 1971)  was an American [[biochemistry|biochemist]], [[virology|virologist]] and [[Nobel laureate]].<ref>{{cite journal | last=Colvig | first=R |date=February 1972 | title=Wendell M, STANLEY, PhD, (1905-1971) | journal=Cancer | volume=29 | issue=2 | pages=541–2 | pmid = 4552137 | doi=10.1002/1097-0142(197202)29:2<541::AID-CNCR2820290246>3.0.CO;2-T| doi-access=free }}</ref>

==Biography==
Stanley was born in [[Ridgeville, Indiana]], and earned a BSc in Chemistry at [[Earlham College]] in [[Richmond, Indiana]].  He then studied at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], gaining an MS in science in 1927 followed by a [[Ph.D.]] in chemistry two years later.  His later accomplishments include writing the book "Chemistry: A Beautiful Thing" and being a Pulitzer Prize nominee.

===Research===
As a member of [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] he moved temporarily for academic work with [[Heinrich Wieland]] in [[Munich]] before he returned to the States in 1931. On return he was approved as an assistant at [[Rockefeller University|The Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research]]. He remained with the Institute until 1948, becoming an Associate Member in 1937, and a Member in 1940.<ref>{{cite news

Stanley's work contributed to  on [[lepracidal compounds]], diphenyl [[stereochemistry]] and the chemistry of the sterols. His research on the [[virus]] causing the [[mosaic disease]] in [[tobacco]] plants led to the isolation of a [[nucleoprotein]] which displayed [[tobacco mosaic virus]] activity.

Stanley was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for 1946. His other notable awards included the Rosenburger Medal, Alder Prize, Scott Award, the Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]]<ref>{{cite web|title= Golden Plate Awardees of the American Academy of Achievement |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=  https://achievement.org/our-history/golden-plate-awards/#science-exploration}}</ref> and the [[AMA Scientific Achievement Award]]. He was also awarded honorary degrees by many universities both American and foreign, including [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and the [[University of Paris]]. Most of the conclusions Stanley had presented in his Nobel-winning research were soon shown to be incorrect (in particular, that the crystals of mosaic virus he had isolated were pure protein, and assembled by [[autocatalysis]]).<ref>{{cite journal | last=Pennazio | first=S |author2=Roggero P  | year= 2000| title=The discovery of the chemical nature of tobacco mosaic virus | journal=Riv.

===Personal life===
Stanley married Marian Staples (1905-1984) in 1929 and had three daughters (Marjorie, Dorothy and Janet) and a son (Wendell Meredith Junior). Stanley Hall at UC Berkeley (now Stanley Biosciences and Bioengineering Facility) and Stanley Hall at Earlham College are named in his honor. His daughter, Marjorie, married Dr. [[Robert Albo]], physician to the [[Golden State Warriors]] basketball team as well as the [[Oakland Raiders]] football team.
