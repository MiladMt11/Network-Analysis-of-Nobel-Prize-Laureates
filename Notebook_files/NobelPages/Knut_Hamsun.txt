'''Knut Hamsun''' (August 4, 1859 &ndash; February 19, 1952) was a Norwegian writer who was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1920. Hamsun's work spans more than 70 years and shows variation with regard to [[consciousness]], subject, [[Point of view (literature)|perspective]] and [[Natural environment|environment]]. He published more than 20 [[novel]]s, a collection of [[poetry]], some [[Short story|short stories]] and [[Play (theatre)|plays]], a [[Travel literature|travelogue]], works of non-fiction and some [[essay]]s.

Hamsun is considered to be "one of the most influential and innovative literary stylists of the past hundred years" (''ca.'' 1890–1990).<ref>Robert Ferguson (1987). ''Enigma: The Life of Knut Hamsun'', New York, N.Y.: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, {{ISBN|978-0-374-52093-9}}</ref> He pioneered psychological literature with techniques of [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] and [[Monologue|interior monologue]], and influenced authors such as [[Thomas Mann]], [[Franz Kafka]], [[Maxim Gorky]], [[Stefan Zweig]], [[Henry Miller]], [[Hermann Hesse]], [[John Fante]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]].<ref name="sptimes">{{cite web|date=2009-11-06|title=The St. Petersburg Times - A complex legacy|url=http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&story_id=30228|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329063942/http://www.sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&story_id=30228|archive-date=2012-03-29|access-date=2011-06-27|publisher=Sptimes.ru}}</ref> [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]] called Hamsun "the father of the modern school of literature in his every aspect—his subjectiveness, his fragmentariness, his use of flashbacks, his [[lyricism]]. The whole modern school of fiction in the twentieth century stems from Hamsun".<ref>[[Isaac Bashevis Singer]] (1967). Introduction to ''[[Hunger (Hamsun novel)|Hunger]]''</ref> Since 1916, several of Hamsun's works have been adapted into [[motion pictures]]. On August 4, 2009, the [[Knut Hamsun Centre]] was opened in [[Hamarøy]].<ref>[http://www.drdharchitects.co.uk/images/AR%20no1351%20-%20Sept%202009%20-%20Hamsun%20Centre.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119133731/http://www.drdharchitects.co.uk/images/AR%20no1351%20-%20Sept%202009%20-%20Hamsun%20Centre.pdf|date=January 19, 2012}}</ref>

The young Hamsun objected to [[Literary realism|realism]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]]. He argued that the main object of [[modernist literature]] should be the intricacies of the human mind, that writers should describe the "whisper of blood, and the pleading of bone marrow".<ref>Knut Hamsun (1890). "Fra det ubevidste Sjæleliv", ''[[Samtiden]]'', September 1890</ref> Hamsun is considered the "leader of the Neo-Romantic revolt at the turn of the 20th century", with works such as ''[[Hunger (Hamsun novel)|Hunger]]'' (1890), ''[[Mysteries (novel)|Mysteries]]'' (1892), ''[[Pan (novel)|Pan]]'' (1894), and ''[[Victoria (novel)|Victoria]]'' (1898).<ref>The new encyclopædia Britannica: Volum 5</ref> His later works—in particular his "[[Nordland]] novels"—were influenced by the [[Norwegian new realism]], portraying everyday life in rural Norway and often employing local dialect, irony, and humour.<ref>Hal May, ''Contemporary Authors'', Volum 119, Gale, 1986</ref> Hamsun only published one poetry collection, ''[[The Wild Choir]]'', which has been set to music by several composers.

Hamsun had strong anti-English views, and openly supported [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Woodard|first=Rob|date=2008-09-10|title=The Nazi novelist you should read|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2008/sep/10/knut.hamsun.nazi|access-date=2021-04-29|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Hagen|first=Erik Bjerck|title=Knut Hamsun|date=2020-02-26|url=http://snl.no/Knut_Hamsun|work=Store norske leksikon|language=nb|access-date=2021-04-29}}</ref> Due to his professed support for the [[German occupation of Norway]], he was charged with [[treason]] after the war.

==Biography==
[[File:Knut Hamsun.jpeg|thumb|200px|left|Hamsun in 1890, the year he published his first major work, ''[[Hunger (Hamsun novel)|Hunger]]''.]]

===Early life===
Knut Hamsun was born as Knud Pedersen in [[Lom, Norway|Lom]] in the [[Gudbrandsdal]] valley of Norway.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1920/hamsun-bio.html Hamsun bio] at Nobel Prize website.</ref> He was the fourth son (of seven children) of Tora Olsdatter and  Peder Pedersen.  When he was three, the family moved to Hamsund, [[Hamarøy]] in [[Nordland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saltenmuseum.no/content/view/68/1/ |title=salten museum - Knut Hamsun's Childhood Home |publisher=Saltenmuseum.no |access-date=2011-06-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610012355/http://www.saltenmuseum.no/content/view/68/1/ |archive-date=2011-06-10 }}</ref> They were poor and an uncle had invited them to farm his land for him.

At nine Knut was separated from his family and lived with his uncle Hans Olsen, who needed help with the post office he ran. Olsen used to beat and starve his nephew, and Hamsun later stated that his chronic nervous difficulties were due to the way his uncle treated him.

In 1874 he finally escaped back to Lom; for the next five years he did any job for money; he was a store clerk, peddler, shoemaker's apprentice, sheriff's assistant, and an elementary-school teacher.<ref>{{cite book |title=Contemporary Authors Online |year=2009 |publisher=Gale|location=[[Farmington Hills, Michigan]] |isbn=978-0-7876-3995-2}}</ref>

At 17 he became a ropemaker's apprentice; at about the same time he started to write. He asked businessman [[Erasmus Zahl]] to give him significant monetary support, and Zahl agreed. Hamsun later used Zahl as a model for the character ''Mack'' appearing in his novels ''[[Pan (novel)|Pan]]'' (1894), ''Dreamers'' (1904), ''Benoni'' (1908) and ''Rosa'' (1908).<ref>Citation: [...] dobbeltromanen Benoni og Rosa fra 1908. I skikkelse av oppkomlingen BenoniHartvigsen tegner Hamsun her for første gang et portrett av en allmuens mann i full skikkelse, med ironisk distanse, men også med betydelig sympati.</ref>

He spent several years in America, traveling and working at various jobs, and published his impressions under the title ''Fra det moderne Amerikas Aandsliv'' (1889).

===Early literary career===
[[File:After Edvard Munch, Knut Hamsun, 1896, NGA 40158.jpg|alt=Photogravure made after the portrait of Hamsun by Edvard Munch in the collection of the National Gallery of Art, Washington DC..|thumb|After Edvard Munch, ''Knut Hamsun'', 1896, photogravure, National Gallery of Art, Washington, Rosenwald Collection, 1951.10.360]]
Working all those odd jobs paid off,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.famousauthors.org/knut-hamsun|title=Knut Hamsun {{!}} Biography, Books and Facts|website=www.famousauthors.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-08}}</ref> and he published his first book: ''Den Gaadefulde: En Kjærlighedshistorie fra Nordland'' (''The Enigmatic Man: A Love Story from Northern Norway'', 1877). It was inspired from the experiences and struggles he endured from his jobs.

In his second novel ''Bjørger'' (1878), he attempted to imitate [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]]'s writing style of the Icelandic saga narrative. The melodramatic story follows a poet, Bjørger, and his love for Laura. This book was published under the pseudonym Knud Pedersen Hamsund. This book later served as the basis for ''Victoria: En Kærligheds Historie'' (1898; translated as ''Victoria: A Love Story'', 1923).<ref name="Næss 2007 loc=1-608">{{Harvnb|Næss|2007|loc=1-608}}.</ref>

===Major works===
Hamsun first received wide acclaim with his 1890 novel [[Hunger (Hamsun novel)|''Hunger'' (''Sult'')]]. The semiautobiographical work described a young writer's descent into near madness as a result of hunger and poverty in the Norwegian capital of [[Kristiania]] (modern name [[Oslo]]). To many, the novel presages the writings of [[Franz Kafka]] and other twentieth-century novelists with its [[internal monologue]] and bizarre logic.

A theme to which Hamsun often returned is that of the perpetual wanderer, an itinerant stranger (often the narrator) who shows up and insinuates himself into the life of small rural communities. This wanderer theme is central to the novels ''[[Mysteries (novel)|Mysteries]]'', ''[[Pan (novel)|Pan]]'', ''[[Under the Autumn Star]]'', ''[[The Last Joy]]'', ''Vagabonds'', ''Rosa'', and others.

Hamsun's prose often contains rapturous depictions of the natural world, with intimate reflections on the Norwegian woodlands and coastline. For this reason, he has been linked with the spiritual movement known as [[pantheism]] ("There is no God," he once wrote. "Only gods.").{{cn|date=August 2021}} Hamsun saw mankind and nature united in a strong, sometimes mystical bond. This connection between the characters and their natural environment is exemplified in the novels ''Pan'', ''A Wanderer Plays on Muted Strings'', and the epic ''[[Growth of the Soil]]'', "his monumental work" credited with securing him the [[Nobel Prize in literature]] in [[1920 in literature|1920]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1920/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1920|publisher=Nobelprize.org|access-date=2011-06-27}}</ref>

===World War II, arrest and trial===
During [[World War II]], Hamsun put his support behind the German war effort. He courted and met with high-ranking Nazi officers, including [[Adolf Hitler]]. Nazi Minister of Propaganda [[Joseph Goebbels]] wrote a long and enthusiastic diary entry concerning a private meeting with Hamsun; according to Goebbels Hamsun's "faith in German victory is unshakable".<ref>''The Goebbels Diaries, 1942–1943,'' translated, edited, and introduced by Louis P. Lochner, 1948, pp. 303–304. Goebbels also claimed that "from childhood on he [Hamsun] has keenly disliked the English".</ref> In 1940 Hamsun wrote that "the Germans are fighting for us".<ref name="Norway: Put Out Three Flags">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,937860,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408135249/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,937860,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 8, 2008 |title=Norway: Put Out Three Flags |magazine=TIME |date=1959-08-17 |access-date=2011-06-27}}</ref> After Hitler's death, he published [[Knut Hamsun's obituary of Adolf Hitler|a short obituary]] in which he described him as "a warrior for mankind" and "a preacher of the gospel of justice for all nations."

After the war, he was detained by police on June 14, 1945, for treason, then committed to a hospital in [[Grimstad]] (''[[Grimstad sykehus]]'') "due to his advanced age", according to [[Einar Kringlen]] (a professor and medical doctor).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/kronikker/960511-kro-1.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311125214/http://www.dagbladet.no/kronikker/960511-kro-1.html|url-status=dead|title=Den 14. juni 1945 ble Hamsun "pågrepet" av politiet, men på grunn av høy alder innlagt på Grimstad sykehus og siden overflyttet til et gamlehjem.

After the war, Hamsun's views on the Germans during the war were a serious grief for the Norwegians, and they tried to separate their world-famous writer from his Nazi beliefs. At the trial Hamsun had pleaded ignorance. Deeper explanations involve his contradictory personality, his distaste for ''[[hoi polloi]]'', his inferiority complex, a profound distress at the spread of indiscipline, antipathy toward the interwar democracy, and especially his anglophobia.<ref>Paul Knaplund, "Knut Hamsun: Triumph and Tragedy." ''Modern Age'' 9#2 (1965): 165+</ref>

===Death===
Knut Hamsun died on February 19, 1952, aged 92, in Grimstad. His ashes are buried in the garden of his home at [[Nørholm]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hamsun.at/hamsun/spor_gri03_d.htm |title=Knut Hamsuns Grab auf Nørholm |language=Norwegian |trans-title=Knut Hamsun's grave on Nørholm |website=hamsun.at}}</ref>

==Legacy==
[[Thomas Mann]] described him as a "descendant of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]." [[Arthur Koestler]] was a fan of his love stories. [[H. G. Wells]] praised ''[[Growth of the Soil|Markens Grøde]]'' (1917) for which  Hamsun was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]] was a fan of his modern subjectivism, use of flashbacks, his use of fragmentation, and his lyricism.<ref name="Næss 2007 loc=1-608"/> A character in [[Charles Bukowski]]'s book ''[[Women (Bukowski novel)|Women]]'' referred to him as the greatest writer who has ever lived.<ref>Charles Bukowski, WOMEN, New York: Ecco Books, 2002. p.67</ref>

A fifteen-volume edition of Hamsun's complete works was published in 1954. In 2009, to mark the 150-year anniversary of his birth, a new 27-volume edition of his complete works was published, including short stories, poetry, plays, and articles not included in the 1954 edition. For this new edition, all of Hamsun's works underwent slight linguistic modifications in order to make them more accessible to contemporary Norwegian readers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gyldendal.no/new/default.asp?ID_Publisher=6&ID_Category=520FC6D1FD4215FAC1256C4C005E7AE2&ID_Product=9788205375550 |title=Gyldendal: Samlede verker 1–27 |language=no |publisher=Gyldendal.no |access-date=2011-06-27}}</ref> Fresh English translations of two of his major works, ''Growth of the Soil'' and ''Pan'', were published in 1998.

Hamsun's works remain popular. In 2009, a Norwegian biographer stated, "We can’t help loving him, though we have hated him all these years ... That’s our Hamsun trauma. He’s a ghost that won’t stay in the grave."<ref name="nyt2009">{{cite news

==Writing techniques==
Along with [[August Strindberg]], [[Henrik Ibsen]], and [[Sigrid Undset]], Hamsun formed a quartet of Scandinavian authors who became internationally known for their works. Hamsun pioneered psychological literature with techniques of [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] and [[Monologue|interior monologue]], as found in material by, for example, [[James Joyce|Joyce]], [[Marcel Proust|Proust]], [[Katherine Mansfield|Mansfield]] and [[Virginia Woolf|Woolf]].

==Personal life==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
[[File:Portrett av Knut Hamsun med familie, Larvik, 1917.jpg|thumb|Family portrait on the stairs of "Villa Havgløtt"; left to right: [[Tore Hamsun]], [[Marie Hamsun]], [[Arild Hamsun]], Knut Hamsun and Ellinor Hamsun.]]

In 1898, Hamsun married Bergljot Göpfert (née Bech), who bore daughter Victoria, but the marriage ended in 1906. Hamsun then married [[Marie Hamsun|Marie Andersen]] (1881-1969) in 1909 and she was his companion until the end of his life. They had four children: sons [[Tore Hamsun|Tore]] and [[Arild Hamsun|Arild]] and daughters Ellinor and Cecilia.

Marie wrote about her life with Hamsun in two [[memoir]]s. She was a promising actress when she met Hamsun but ended her career and traveled with him to Hamarøy. They bought a farm, the idea being "to earn their living as farmers, with his writing providing some additional income".

After a few years they decided to move south, to [[Larvik]]. In 1918 they bought [[Nørholm]], an old, somewhat dilapidated manor house between [[Lillesand]] and [[Grimstad]]. The main residence was restored and redecorated. Here Hamsun could occupy himself with writing undisturbed, although he often travelled to write in other cities and places (preferably in spartan housing).

==Political sympathies==
In his younger years, Hamsun had leanings of an [[anti-egalitarian]] and [[Racism|racist]] bend. In ''The Cultural Life of Modern America'' (1889), he expressed his firm opposition to miscegenation: "The [[African Americans|Negros]] are and will remain Negros, a nascent human form from the tropics, rudimentary organs on the body of white society. Instead of founding an intellectual elite, America has established a mulatto studfarm."<ref>{{cite book|last=Sjølyst-Jackson|first=Peter|title=Troubling legacies: migration, modernism and fascism in the case of Knut Hamsun|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|location=2010|page=16}}</ref>

Following the [[Second Boer War]], he adopted increasingly [[conservative]] views. He also came to be known as a prominent advocate of [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Culture of Germany|German culture]], as well as a steadfast opponent of the [[British Empire]] and the [[Soviet Union]]. During both [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], he publicly expressed his sympathy for the [[German Empire]] and [[Nazi Germany]].

His sympathies were heavily influenced by the Second Boer War, which was perceived by Hamsun as British aggression against a weak nation, as well as by his Anglophobia and [[Anti-Americanism]]. During the 1930s, most of the Norwegian right-wing newspapers and political parties were sympathetic in various degrees to [[Fascism|fascist]] regimes in Europe, and Hamsun came to be a prominent advocate of such views. During World War II, he continued to express his support for Germany, and his public statements led to controversy; in particular, in the immediate aftermath of the war. When World War II began, he was 80 years old, almost deaf, and his main source of information was the conservative newspaper ''[[Aftenposten]]'', which had been sympathetic to Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany from the beginning. He suffered two [[intracranial hemorrhage]]s during the war.

Hamsun wrote several newspaper articles in the course of the war, including his notorious 1940 assertion that "the Germans are fighting for us, and now are crushing England's tyranny over us and all neutrals".<ref name="Norway: Put Out Three Flags"/> In 1943, he sent Germany's minister of [[propaganda]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] his [[Nobel Prize]] medal as a gift. His biographer [[Thorkild Hansen]] interpreted this as part of the strategy to get an audience with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitle]]r.<ref>[[Thorkild Hansen]], ''Prosessen mod Hamsun'', 1978</ref> Hamsun was eventually invited to meet with Hitler; during the meeting, he complained about the German civilian administrator in Norway, [[Josef Terboven]], and asked that imprisoned Norwegian citizens be released, enraging Hitler.<ref>{{cite web|author=Morton Strand |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2012/11/28/kultur/nobels_fredspris/utenriks/debatt/24578334/ |title=Fikk Hitler og Aftenposten til å rase |date=7 December 2012 |publisher=Dagbladet.no |access-date=2014-05-20}}</ref> [[Otto Dietrich]] describes the meeting in his memoirs as the only time that another person was able to get a word in edgeways with Hitler. He attributes the cause to Hamsun's deafness. Regardless, Dietrich notes that it took Hitler three days to get over his anger.<ref>Otto Dietrich, ''The Hitler I Knew'', p. 8</ref> Hamsun also on other occasions helped Norwegians who had been imprisoned for resistance activities and tried to influence German policies in Norway.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.norgeslexi.com/krigslex/h/h2.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-08-22 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090822231637/http://www.norgeslexi.com/krigslex/h/h2.html |archive-date=2009-08-22 }}</ref>

Nevertheless, a week after Hitler's death, [[Knut Hamsun's obituary of Adolf Hitler|Hamsun wrote a eulogy for him]], saying “He was a warrior, a warrior for mankind, and a prophet of the gospel of justice for all nations.”<ref name="nyt2009"/> Following the end of the war, angry crowds [[Book burning|burned his books]] in public in major Norwegian cities and Hamsun was confined for several months in a psychiatric hospital.

Hamsun was forced to undergo a psychiatric examination, which concluded that he had "permanently impaired mental faculties," and on that basis the charges of treason were dropped. Instead, a [[civil liability]] case was raised against him, and in 1948 he had to pay a ruinous sum to the Norwegian government of 325,000 [[Norwegian krone|kroner]] ($65,000 or £16,250 at that time) for his alleged membership in [[Nasjonal Samling]] and for the moral support he gave to the Germans, but was cleared of any direct Nazi affiliation. Whether he was a member of Nasjonal Samling or not and whether his mental abilities were impaired is a much debated issue even today. Hamsun stated he was never a member of any political party.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} He wrote his last book ''Paa giengrodde Stier'' (''[[On Overgrown Paths]]'') in 1949, a book many take as evidence of his functioning mental capabilities.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} In it, he harshly criticizes the psychiatrists and the judges and, in his own words, proves that he is not mentally ill.

The Danish author [[Thorkild Hansen]] investigated the trial and wrote the book ''The Hamsun Trial'' (1978), which created a storm in Norway. Among other things Hansen stated: "If you want to meet idiots, go to Norway," as he felt that such treatment of the old Nobel Prize-winning author was outrageous. In [[1996 in film|1996]], Swedish filmmaker [[Jan Troell]] based the movie ''Hamsun'' on Hansen's book. In ''Hamsun'', Swedish actor [[Max von Sydow]] plays Knut Hamsun; his wife Marie is played by Danish actress [[Ghita Nørby]].

==Studies on Hamsun's writings==
Hamsun's writings have been the subject of numerous books and journal articles. Some of these writings explore the dialectic between Hamsun's literary works and his political and cultural leanings expressed in his non-fiction.
