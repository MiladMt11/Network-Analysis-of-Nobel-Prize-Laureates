==Biography==

===Early life===
Hendrik Lorentz was born in [[Arnhem]], [[Gelderland]], [[Netherlands]], the son of Gerrit Frederik Lorentz (1822–1893), a well-off horticulturist, and Geertruida van Ginkel (1826–1861). In 1862, after his mother's death, his father married Luberta Hupkes. Despite being raised as a Protestant, he was a [[Freethought|freethinker]] in religious matters.<ref group=B>{{cite web |title=Lorentz, Hendrik Antoon |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Hendrik_Antoon_Lorentz.aspx |publisher=Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography |access-date=25 April 2012 |author=Russell McCormmach |quote=Although he grew up in Protestant circles, he was a freethinker in religious matters; he regularly attended the local French church to improve his French.}}</ref> From 1866 to 1869, he attended the "''[[Hogere Burgerschool]]''" in Arnhem, a new type of public high school recently established by [[Johan Rudolph Thorbecke]]. His results in school were exemplary; not only did he excel in the physical sciences and mathematics, but also in English, French, and German. In 1870, he passed the exams in [[classical languages]] which were then required for admission to University.<ref group=B name="NtvN2011">{{cite journal |first=Anne J. |last=Kox |title=Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (in Dutch) |journal=Nederlands Tijdschirft voor Natuurkunde |volume=77 |issue=12 |page=441 |year=2011}}</ref>

Lorentz studied [[physics]] and [[mathematics]] at [[Leiden University]], where he was strongly influenced by the teaching of astronomy professor [[Frederik Kaiser]]; it was his influence that led him to become a physicist. After earning a [[bachelor's degree]], he returned to Arnhem in 1871 to teach night school classes in mathematics, but he continued his studies in [[Leiden]] in addition to his teaching position. In 1875, Lorentz earned a [[doctoral degree]] under [[Pieter Rijke]] on a thesis entitled "''{{lang|nl|Over de theorie der terugkaatsing en breking van het licht}}''" (On the theory of reflection and refraction of light), in which he refined the electromagnetic theory of [[James Clerk Maxwell]].<ref group=B name="NtvN2011"/><ref>{{cite web |author=Hendrik Lorentz |url=http://ilorentz.org/history/proefschriften/sources/Lorentz_1875.pdf |title=Over de theorie der terugkaatsing en breking van het licht |year=1875}}</ref>

===Career===

====Professor in Leiden====
On 17 November 1877, only 24 years of age, Hendrik Antoon Lorentz was appointed to the newly established chair in theoretical physics at the [[University of Leiden]]. The position had initially been offered to [[Johannes Diderik van der Waals|Johan van der Waals]], but he accepted a position at the [[Universiteit van Amsterdam]].<ref group=B name="NtvN2011"/> On 25 January 1878, Lorentz delivered his inaugural lecture on ''"{{lang|nl|De moleculaire theoriën in de natuurkunde}}"'' (The molecular theories in physics). In 1881, he became member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00001670 |title=Hendrik Antoon Lorentz (1853–1928) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |access-date=17 July 2015}}</ref>

During the first twenty years in Leiden, Lorentz was primarily interested in the electromagnetic theory of electricity, magnetism, and light. After that, he extended his research to a much wider area while still focusing on theoretical physics. Lorentz made significant contributions to fields ranging from [[hydrodynamics]] to [[general relativity]]. His most important contributions were in the area of electromagnetism, the electron theory, and relativity.<ref group=B name="NtvN2011"/>

Lorentz theorized that [[atom]]s might consist of charged particles and suggested that the oscillations of these charged particles were the source of light. When a colleague and former student of Lorentz's, [[Pieter Zeeman]], discovered the [[Zeeman effect]] in 1896, Lorentz supplied its theoretical interpretation. The experimental and theoretical work was honored with the Nobel prize in physics in 1902. Lorentz' name is now associated with the [[Lorentz–Lorenz equation]], the [[Lorentz force]], the [[Lorentzian distribution]], and the [[Lorentz transformation]].

In 1892 and 1895, Lorentz worked on describing electromagnetic phenomena (the propagation of light) in reference frames that move relative to the postulated [[luminiferous aether]].<ref>{{Citation

Although Lorentz did not give a detailed interpretation of the physical significance of local time, with it, he could explain the [[aberration of light]] and the result of the [[Fizeau experiment]]. In 1900 and 1904, [[Henri Poincaré]] called local time Lorentz's "most ingenious idea" and illustrated it by showing that clocks in moving frames are synchronized by exchanging light signals that are assumed to travel at the same speed against and with the motion of the frame<ref>{{Citation

It was apparently unknown to Lorentz that [[Joseph Larmor]] had used identical transformations to describe orbiting electrons in 1897. Larmor's and Lorentz's equations look somewhat dissimilar, but they are algebraically equivalent to those presented by Poincaré and Einstein in 1905.<ref name=Macrossan group=B /> Lorentz's 1904 paper includes the covariant formulation of electrodynamics, in which electrodynamic phenomena in different reference frames are described by identical equations with well defined transformation properties. The paper clearly recognizes the significance of this formulation, namely that the outcomes of electrodynamic experiments do not depend on the relative motion of the reference frame. The 1904 paper includes a detailed discussion of the increase of the inertial mass of rapidly moving objects in a useless attempt to make momentum look exactly like Newtonian momentum; it was also an attempt to explain the length contraction as the accumulation of "stuff" onto mass making it slow and contract.

In 1906, Lorentz's electron theory received a full-fledged treatment in his lectures at [[Columbia University]], published under the title The Theory of Electrons.

The increase of mass was the first prediction of Lorentz and Einstein to be tested, but some experiments by [[Walter Kaufmann (physicist)|Kaufmann]] appeared to show a slightly different mass increase; this led Lorentz to the famous remark that he was "au bout de mon latin" ("at the end of my [knowledge of] Latin" = at his wit's end)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.univ-nancy2.fr/poincare/chp/text/lorentz1.html |title=Lorentz à Poincaré |access-date=31 March 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050221211608/http://www.univ-nancy2.fr/poincare/chp/text/lorentz1.html |archive-date=21 February 2005 }}</ref>  The confirmation of his prediction had to wait until 1908 and later (see [[Kaufmann–Bucherer–Neumann experiments]]).

Lorentz published a series of papers dealing with what he called "Einstein's principle of relativity".

{{Quote|It will be clear by what has been said that the impressions received by the two observers A0 and A would be alike in all respects. It would be impossible to decide which of them moves or stands still with respect to the ether, and there would be no reason for preferring the times and lengths measured by the one to those determined by the other, nor for saying that either of them is in possession of the "true" times or the "true" lengths. This is a point which Einstein has laid particular stress on, in a theory in which he starts from what he calls the principle of relativity, I cannot speak here of the many highly interesting applications which Einstein has made of this principle. His results concerning electromagnetic and optical phenomena agree in the main with those which we have obtained in the preceding pages, the chief difference being that Einstein simply postulates what we have deduced, with some difficulty and not altogether satisfactorily, from the fundamental equations of the electromagnetic field. By doing so, he may certainly take credit for making us see in the negative result of experiments like those of Michelson, Rayleigh and Brace, not a fortuitous compensation of opposing effects, but the manifestation of a general and fundamental principle. It would be unjust not to add that, besides the fascinating boldness of its starting point, Einstein's theory has another marked advantage over mine. Whereas I have not been able to obtain for the equations referred to moving axes ''exactly'' the same form as for those which apply to a stationary system, Einstein has accomplished this by means of a system of new variables slightly different from those which I have introduced.|author=|title=|source=}}

Though Lorentz still maintained that there is an (undetectable) aether in which resting clocks indicate the "true time":

{{Quote|1909: Yet, I think, something may also be claimed in favour of the form in which I have presented the theory. I cannot but regard the ether, which can be the seat of an electromagnetic field with its energy and its vibrations, as endowed with a certain degree of substantiality, however different it may be from all ordinary matter.<ref name=lor09 /><br /> 1910: Provided that there is an aether, then under all systems x, y, z, t, one is preferred by the fact, that the coordinate axes as well as the clocks are resting in the aether. If one connects with this the idea (which I would abandon only reluctantly) that space and time are completely different things, and that there is a "true time" (simultaneity thus would be independent of the location, in agreement with the circumstance that we can have the idea of infinitely great velocities), then it can be easily seen that this true time should be indicated by clocks at rest in the aether. However, if the relativity principle had general validity in nature, one wouldn't be in the position to determine, whether the reference system just used is the preferred one. Then one comes to the same results, as if one (following Einstein and Minkowski) deny the existence of the aether and of true time, and to see all reference systems as equally valid. Which of these two ways of thinking one is following, can surely be left to the individual.<ref name=lor10 />}}

No, it was the mechanics of Lorentz, the one dealing with the principle of relativity; the one which, hardly five years ago, seemed to be the height of boldness.|author=|title=|source=}}

====Change of priorities====
In 1910, Lorentz decided to reorganize his life. His teaching and management duties at Leiden University were taking up too much of his time, leaving him little time for research. In 1912, he resigned from his chair of theoretical physics to become curator of the "Physics Cabinet" at [[Teylers Museum]] in [[Haarlem]]. He remained connected to Leiden University as an external professor, and his "Monday morning lectures" on new developments in theoretical physics soon became legendary.<ref group=B name="NtvN2011"/>

Lorentz initially asked Einstein to succeed him as professor of theoretical physics at Leiden. However, Einstein could not accept because he had just accepted a position at [[ETH Zurich]]. Einstein had no regrets in this matter, since the prospect of having to fill Lorentz's shoes made him shiver. Instead Lorentz appointed [[Paul Ehrenfest]] as his successor in the chair of theoretical  physics at the Leiden University, who would found the Institute for Theoretical Physics which would become known as the [[Lorentz Institute]].<ref group=B name="NtvN2011"/>

====Civil work====
After World War I, Lorentz was one of the driving forces behind the founding of the "Wetenschappelijke Commissie van Advies en Onderzoek in het Belang van Volkswelvaart en Weerbaarheid", a committee which was to harness the scientific potential united in the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (KNAW) for solving civil problems such as food shortage which had resulted from the war. Lorentz was appointed chair of the committee. However, despite the best efforts of many of the participants the committee would harvest little success. The only exception being that it ultimately resulted in the founding of TNO, the [[Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research]].<ref group=B name="NtvN2011"/>

Lorentz was also asked by the Dutch government to chair a committee to calculate some of the effects of the proposed [[Afsluitdijk]] (Enclosure Dam) flood control dam on water levels in the [[Waddenzee]]. [[Hydraulic engineering]] was mainly an empirical science at that time, but the disturbance of the tidal flow caused by the Afsluitdijk was so unprecedented that the empirical rules could not be trusted. Originally Lorentz was only supposed to have a coordinating role in the committee, but it quickly became apparent that Lorentz was the only physicist to have any fundamental traction on the problem. In the period 1918 till 1926, Lorentz invested a large portion of his time in the problem.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.radionetherlandsarchives.org/lorentz-the-grand-old-man-of-physics/|title=Lorentz: the Grand Old Man of Physics|date=13 March 2000}}</ref> Lorentz proposed to start from the basic [[hydrodynamic]] equations of motion and solve the problem numerically. This was feasible for a "[[human computer]]", because of the quasi-one-dimensional nature of the water flow in the [[Waddenzee]]. The Afsluitdijk was completed in 1932, and the predictions of Lorentz and his committee turned out to be remarkably accurate.<ref group=B>{{cite web|url=http://ilorentz.org/history/zuiderzee/zuiderzee.html |title=Carlo Beenakker |publisher=Ilorentz.org |access-date=1 February 2012}}</ref><ref group=B name="NtvN2011"/> One of the two sets of locks in the Afsluitdijk was named after him.

===Family life===
In 1881, Lorentz married Aletta Catharina Kaiser. Her father was J.W. Kaiser, a professor at the Academy of Fine Arts. He was the Director of the museum which later became the well-known [[Rijksmuseum]] (National Gallery). He also was the designer of the first postage stamps of The Netherlands.

There were two daughters, and one son from this marriage.

[[Geertruida de Haas-Lorentz|Dr. Geertruida Luberta Lorentz]], the eldest daughter, was a physicist. She married Professor [[Wander Johannes de Haas]], who was the Director of the Cryogenic Laboratory at the University of Leiden.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1902/lorentz/biographical/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1902|website=NobelPrize.org}}</ref>

===Death===
In January 1928, Lorentz became seriously ill, and died shortly after on 4 February.<ref group=B name="NtvN2011"/> The respect in which he was held in the Netherlands is apparent from [[Owen Willans Richardson]]'s description of his funeral:

{{Quote|text=The funeral took place at Haarlem at noon on Friday, February 10. At the stroke of twelve the State telegraph and telephone services of Holland were suspended for three minutes as a revered tribute to the greatest man the Netherlands has produced in our time. It was attended by many colleagues and distinguished physicists from foreign countries. The President, [[Ernest Rutherford|Sir Ernest Rutherford]], represented the Royal Society and made an appreciative oration by the graveside. |author=O. W.  Richardson<ref group=B name=richardson/>}}

Unique 1928 film footage of the funeral procession with a lead carriage followed by ten mourners, followed by a carriage with the coffin, followed in turn by at least four more carriages, passing by a crowd at the [[Grote Markt, Haarlem]] from the Zijlstraat to the Smedestraat, and then back again through the Grote Houtstraat towards the Barteljorisstraat, on the way to the "Algemene Begraafplaats" at the Kleverlaan (northern Haarlem cemetery) has been digitized on [[YouTube]].<ref group=B>{{YouTube|H2VtrJD0xJk|Funeral procession}} Hendrik Lorentz</ref> Amongst others, the funeral was attended by Albert Einstein and [[Marie Curie]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Treffende begrafenis van Lorentz |trans-title=Striking funeral of Lorentz |language=nl |url=http://resolver.kb.nl/resolve?urn=ddd:110565430:mpeg21:p005 |newspaper=[[De Telegraaf]] |location=Haarlem |date=9 February 1928 |quote=''Mme. Curie uit Parijs; ... prof. dr. A. Einstein uit Berlijn;''}}</ref> Einstein gave a eulogy at a memorial service at Leiden University.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

==Legacy==
Lorentz is considered one of the prime representatives of the "Second Dutch Golden Age", a period of several decades surrounding 1900 in which the natural sciences flourished in the Netherlands.<ref group=B name="NtvN2011"/>

Richardson describes Lorentz as:

<blockquote>A man of remarkable intellectual powers. Although steeped in his own investigation of the moment, he always seemed to have in his immediate grasp its ramifications into every corner of the universe. The singular clearness of his writings provides a striking reflection of his wonderful powers in this respect. He possessed and successfully employed the mental vivacity which is necessary to follow the interplay of discussion, the insight which is required to extract those statements which illuminate the real difficulties, and the wisdom to lead the discussion among fruitful channels, and he did this so skillfully that the process was hardly perceptible.<ref group=B name=richardson /></blockquote>

M. J. Klein (1967) wrote of Lorentz's reputation in the 1920s:

<blockquote>For many years physicists had always been eager "to hear what Lorentz will say about it" when a new theory was advanced, and, even at seventy-two, he did not disappoint them.<ref group=B name=Przibram/></blockquote>

In addition to the [[Nobel prize]], Lorentz received a great many honours for his outstanding work. He was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1905|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1905]].<ref name=frs>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150316060617/https://royalsociety.org/about-us/fellowship/fellows/|archive-date=16 March 2015|url=https://royalsociety.org/about-us/fellowship/fellows/|publisher=[[Royal Society]]|location=London|title=Fellows of the Royal Society}}</ref> The Society awarded him their [[Rumford Medal]] in 1908 and their [[Copley Medal]] in 1918. He was elected an Honorary Member of the [[Royal Netherlands Chemical Society|Netherlands Chemical Society]] in 1912.<ref>[https://en.kncv.nl/kncv/honorary-members Honorary members] – website of the Royal Netherlands Chemical Society</ref>
