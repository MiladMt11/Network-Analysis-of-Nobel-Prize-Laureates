In 1912, Sabatier was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] along with [[Victor Grignard]].  Sabatier was honoured for his work improving the [[hydrogenation]] of organic species in the presence of metals.

==Education==

Sabatier studied at the [[École normale supérieure|École Normale Supérieure]], starting in 1874.  Three years later, he graduated at the top of his class.<ref name=nobel />  In 1880, he was awarded a [[Doctor of Science]] degree from the [[Collège de France|College de France]].<ref name=nobel />

In 1883 Sabatier succeeded [[Édouard Filhol]] at the Faculty of Science, and began a long collaboration with [[Jean-Baptiste Senderens]], so close that it was impossible to distinguish the work of either man.
They jointly published 34 notes in the ''Accounts of the Academy of Science'', 11 memoirs in the ''Bulletin of the French Chemical Society'' and 2 joint memoirs to the ''Annals of Chemistry and Physics''.{{sfn|Alcouffe|2006|p=10}}
The [[methanation]] reactions of COx were first discovered by Sabatier and Senderens in 1902.{{sfn|Rönsch|Schneider|Matthischke|Schlüter|2016}}
Sabatier and Senderen shared the Academy of Science's Jecker Prize in 1905 for their discovery of the Sabatier–Senderens Process.{{sfn|Alcouffe|2006|p=10}}

After 1905–06 Senderens and Sabatier published few joint works, perhaps due to the classic problem of recognition of the merit of contributions to joint work.{{sfn|Alcouffe|2006|p=10}}
Sabatier taught science classes most of his life before he became Dean of the Faculty of Science at the [[University of Toulouse]] in 1905.

==Research==
Sabatier's earliest research concerned the [[thermochemistry]] of [[sulfur]] and metallic [[sulfate]]s, the subject for the thesis leading to his doctorate. In [[Toulouse]], he continued his [[physics|physical]] and chemical investigations to [[sulfide]]s, [[chloride]]s, [[Chromate ion|chromate]]s and [[copper]] compounds. He also studied the [[oxide]]s of [[nitrogen]] and nitrosodisulfonic acid and its [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s and carried out fundamental research on [[partition coefficient]]s and [[absorption spectrum|absorption spectra]].  Sabatier greatly facilitated the industrial use of [[hydrogenation]]. In 1897, building on the recent biochemical work of the American chemist, [[James F. Boyce, Sr.|James Boyce]], he discovered that the introduction of a trace amount of [[nickel]] (as a catalyst) facilitated the addition of hydrogen to molecules of most carbon compounds.

The reduction of [[carbon dioxide]] using [[hydrogen]] at high temperature and pressure is another use of nickel [[catalyst]] to produce [[methane]]. This is called the [[Sabatier reaction]] and is used in the [[International Space Station]] to produce the necessary water without relying on stock from the earth.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/sabatier.html|title=The Sabatier System: Producing Water on the Space Station|last=Administrator|first=NASA Content|date=2015-08-17|work=NASA|access-date=2018-09-06|language=en}}</ref>

Sabatier is best known for the [[Sabatier process]] and his works such as ''La Catalyse en Chimie Organique'' (Catalysis in organic chemistry) which was published in 1913. He won the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] jointly with fellow Frenchman [[Victor Grignard]] in 1912.<ref name=nobel /> He is also known for the [[Sabatier principle]] of catalysis.

==Personal life==
[[File:Paul Sabatier Office Toulouse 2012.jpg|thumb|right|Sabatier's office desk and collection of chemicals at the University of Toulouse]]
Sabatier was married with four daughters, one of whom wed the Italian chemist Emilio Pomilio.<ref name=nobel>{{cite web|title=Paul Sabatier - Biography | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1912/sabatier-bio.html|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|access-date=2013-12-07}}</ref>

The [[Paul Sabatier University]] in [[Toulouse]] is named in honour of Paul Sabatier. Paul Sabatier was a co-founder of the [[Annales de la Faculté des Sciences de Toulouse]], together with the mathematician [[Thomas Joannes Stieltjes]].
