'''Horst Ludwig Störmer''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhɔʁst ˈluːtvɪç ˈʃtœʁmɐ|-|De-Horst Ludwig Störmer.ogg}}; born April 6, 1949) is a German physicist, [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel laureate]] and [[emeritus professor]] at [[Columbia University]].<ref name="columbia">[http://apam.columbia.edu/horst-stormer Home page at Columbia]</ref>
He was awarded the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics jointly with [[Daniel Tsui]] and [[Robert Laughlin]] "for their discovery of a new form of [[quantum fluid]] with fractionally charged excitations" (the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]]).<ref>{{Citation

==Biography==
Störmer was born in [[Frankfurt am Main]], and grew up in the nearby town of [[Sprendlingen]]. After graduating from the Goetheschule in [[Neu-Isenburg]] in 1967, he enrolled in architectural engineering at the [[Technische Universität Darmstadt|TH Darmstadt]], but later moved to the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt]] to study physics, but since he had missed the registration period for physics, he began with a mathematics and later changed to physics, qualifying for his Diploma in the laboratory of Prof. Werner Martienssen. Here he was supervised by Prof. Eckhardt Hoenig, and worked alongside another future Nobel laureate, [[Gerd Binnig]].<ref name="nobelbio">{{Nobelprize}}</ref>

Störmer moved to France to carry out his PhD research in Grenoble, working in a high-magnetic field laboratory which was run jointly between the French CNRS and the German Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research.  Störmer's academic advisor was Prof. Hans-Joachim Queisser, and he was awarded a PhD by the [[University of Stuttgart]] in 1977 for his thesis on investigations of electron hole droplets subject to high magnetic fields.  He also met his wife, Dominique Parchet, while working in Grenoble.<ref name="nobelbio" /> They divorced each other a few years later.

After receiving his PhD, Störmer moved to the US to work at [[Bell Labs]], where he carried out the research that led to his Nobel prize.<ref name="nobelbio" /> After working at Bell Labs for 20 years, he became the [[I.I. Rabi]] professor of [[physics]] and [[applied physics]] at [[Columbia University]] in New York City. He was elected to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|title=APS Member History|url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=Horst+L.+Stormer&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced|access-date=2021-05-21|website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref> He retired as professor emeritus in 2011.<ref name="columbia" /><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Horst-Stormer |title = Horst L.

Störmer is a naturalized US citizen.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.nndb.com/people/075/000099775/ |title = Horst L. Störmer}}</ref>

==Research career==
Perhaps as important as the work for which he won the Nobel prize is his invention of [[modulation doping]], a method for making extremely high mobility two dimensional electron systems in semiconductors.  This enabled the later observation of the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]], which was discovered by Störmer and Tsui in October 1981 in an experiment carried out in the Francis Bitter High Magnetic Field Lab at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].  Within a year of the experimental discovery, [[Robert Laughlin]] was able to explain its results.  Störmer, Tsui and Laughlin were jointly awarded the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics for their work.<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1998/press.html Nobel Prize press release]</ref>
