'''Daniel Carleton Gajdusek''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|aɪ|d|ə|ʃ|ɛ|k}} {{respell|GHY|də|shek}};<ref name=holley>Holley, Joe (December 16, 2008) "D. Carleton Gajdusek; Controversial Scientist", ''[[The Washington Post]]'', p. B5.</ref> September 9, 1923 – December 12, 2008) was an American [[physician]] and medical researcher who was the co-recipient (with [[Baruch S. Blumberg]]) of the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1976 for work on an infectious agent which would later be identified as the cause of [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]], the first known human [[prion disease]].<ref name=nobel>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1976/press.html|title=Physiology or Medicine 1976 – Press Release|publisher=Nobelprize.org|date=14 October 1976|access-date=21 July 2018}}</ref>

In 1996, Gajdusek was charged with [[child molestation]] and, after being convicted, spent 12 months in prison before entering a self-imposed exile in Europe, where he died a decade later. His papers are held at the [[National Library of Medicine]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/gajdusek565|title=D.

==Early life and education==
Gajdusek's father, Karol Gajdusek, was a butcher, an ethnic [[Slovaks|Slovak]] from Büdöskő, [[Kingdom of Hungary]] (now [[Smrdáky]], [[Slovakia]]). His maternal grandparents, ethnic Hungarians of the [[Calvinism|Calvinist faith]], emigrated from [[Debrecen]], Hungary. Gajdusek was born in [[Yonkers]], New York, and graduated in 1943 from the [[University of Rochester]], where he studied physics, biology, chemistry and mathematics. He obtained an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1946 and performed postdoctoral research at [[Columbia University]], the [[California Institute of Technology]], and Harvard. In 1951, Gajdusek was drafted into the U.S. Army and assigned as a research [[Virology|virologist]] at the Walter Reed [[Army Medical Service Graduate School]].<ref name="la-times">{{cite news |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |title=D.

There, he began the work that culminated in the [[Nobel prize]]. He was elected as a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1978.<ref>{{Cite web|title=APS Member History|url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=gajdusek&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced|access-date=2021-05-19|website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref>

==Kuru research==
Gajdusek's best-known work focused on [[Kuru (disease)|kuru]]. This disease was rampant among the [[Fore tribe|South Fore people]] of [[New Guinea]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Gajdusek connected the spread of the disease to the practice of [[Endocannibalism|funerary cannibalism]] by the South Fore. With elimination of cannibalism, kuru disappeared among the South Fore within a generation.

Gajdusek was introduced to the problem of kuru by [[Vincent Zigas]], a district medical officer in the Fore Tribe region of New Guinea. Gajdusek provided the first medical description of this unique [[neurological disorder]], which was miscast in the popular press as the "laughing sickness" because some patients displayed [[risus sardonicus]] as a symptom. He lived among the Fore, studied their [[Fore language|language]] and culture, and performed [[autopsy|autopsies]] on kuru victims.

Gajdusek concluded that kuru was transmitted by the ritualistic consumption of the brains of deceased relatives, which was practiced by the Fore. He then proved this hypothesis by successfully transmitting the disease to primates and demonstrating that it had an unusually long incubation period of several years.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gajdusek |first1=D.

This was the first demonstration of the infectious spread of a noninflammatory degenerative disease in humans.

Kuru was shown to have remarkable similarity to [[scrapie]], a disease of sheep and goats caused by an unconventional infectious agent. Subsequently, additional human agents belonging to the same group were discovered. They include sporadic, familial, and variant [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]]. Gajdusek recognized that diseases like Kuru and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease were caused by a new infectious agent that had not yet been identified.<ref name=nobel/> Further research on the scrapie agent by [[Stanley Prusiner]] and others led to the identification of endogenous proteins called [[prion]]s as the cause of these diseases.

==="Unconventional viruses"===
In his 1977 paper "Unconventional Viruses and the Origin and Disappearance of Kuru," Gajdusek postulated that the cause of kuru, scrapie and  Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease were caused by what he termed an unconventional virus. In comparison to normal viruses, unconventional viruses had a long [[incubation period]] and did not cause an [[immune response]] in the host. Although Gajdusek noted that there were no demonstrable [[nucleic acid]]s in unconventional viruses, he did not rule out the possibility that unconventional viruses contained [[RNA]] at a low level, despite their [[radiation resistance]]<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1744284|title = Unconventional Viruses and the Origin and Disappearance of Kuru|journal = Science|volume = 197|issue = 4307|pages = 943–960|last1 = Gajdusek|first1 = D. Carleton|s2cid = 2046908|year = 1977|doi = 10.1126/science.142303|pmid = 142303|bibcode = 1977Sci...197..943C}}</ref>

These infectious agents were later discovered to be misfolded proteins, or prions.

==Child molestation allegations and convictions==
In the course of his research trips in the South Pacific, Gajdusek had brought 56 mostly male children back to live with him in the United States, and provided them with the opportunity to receive high school and college education. One of these boys, now a grown man, later accused Gajdusek of [[child molestation|molesting]] him as a child.

Gajdusek was charged with child molestation in April 1996, based on incriminating entries in his personal diary and statements from a victim. He pleaded guilty in 1997 and, under a [[plea bargain]], was sentenced to 12 months in jail. After his release in 1998, he was permitted to serve his five-year unsupervised [[probation]] in Europe. He never returned to the United States and lived in [[Amsterdam]], spending winters in [[Tromsø]], [[Norway]],<ref name=richmond>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/feb/25/carleton-gajdusek-obituary|title=Carleton Gajdusek|author=Richmond C|date=24 Feb 2009|work=The Guardian|access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref> where the [[polar night]] around the [[winter solstice]] helped him to do more work.<ref name=holley/>

Gajdusek's treatment was denounced in October 1996 as [[anti-elitism|anti-elitist]] and unduly harsh by controversial former [[Edinburgh University]] psychologist [[Chris Brand]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Wojtas |first=Olga |title='Racist' Brand loses dismissal appeal |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=106530&sectioncode=26 |magazine=[[Times Higher Education]] |date=March 27, 1998 |access-date=May 12, 2012}}</ref>

The documentary ''The Genius and the Boys'' by [[Bosse Lindquist]], first shown on [[BBC Four]] on June 1, 2009, notes that "seven men testified in confidentiality about Gajdusek having had sex with them when they were boys," that four said "the sex was untroubling" while for three of them "the sex was a shaming, abusive and a violation." One of these boys, the son of a friend and now an adult, appears in the film. Furthermore, Gajdusek openly admits to molesting boys and his approval of [[incest]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Lindquist |first=Bosse |author-link=Bosse Lindquist |publisher=[[BBC Four]] |title=The Genius and the Boys |series=Storyville |date=June 1, 2009 |access-date=May 12, 2012 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00ktrc0}}</ref> The film tries to analyse Gajdusek's sexual behaviour, and also to understand his motivations for science, exploration and life.

==Death and legacy==
Gajdusek died December 12, 2008, in [[Tromsø]], [[Norway]], at the age of 85. He was working and visiting colleagues in Tromsø at the time of his death.<ref>{{cite news |author-link=Donald G.

[[Hanya Yanagihara]]'s 2013 novel, ''[[The People in the Trees]]'', is based on Gajdusek's life, research, and child molestation conviction.<ref>{{cite news |first=Carmela |last=Ciuraru |title=Bitter Fruit: 'The People in the Trees,' by Hanya Yanagihara |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 27, 2013 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/29/books/review/the-people-in-the-trees-by-hanya-yanagihara.html |access-date=March 12, 2015 }}</ref> The novel centers on a character named A. Norton Perinha, inspired by Gajdusek, who researches the life-extending properties of sacred turtle meat in Micronesia.<ref>{{cite book |last=Yanagihara |first=Hanya |date=August 13, 2013 |title=The People in the Trees |publisher=Doubleday |isbn=978-0385536776 }}</ref>
