==Early biography==
Pire was born in [[Dinant]], [[Belgium]]. He was the eldest child of four born to Georges Pire, Sr., a civic official, and Berthe (Ravet) Pire.<ref>{{Nobelprize|accessdate=29 April 2020|name=Georges Pire}}</ref>

At the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1914 Pire's family fled from Belgium to [[France]] in a boat to escape advancing German troops.  After the armistice of 1918 the family was able to return to Dinant, which had been reduced to ruins.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fesd.es/content/dominique-pire |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-10-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702014247/http://www.fesd.es/content/dominique-pire |archive-date=2012-07-02 }}  Accessed October, 2012</ref>

==Education==
Pire studied Classics and Philosophy at the Collège de Bellevue and at the age of eighteen entered the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priory of La Sarte in [[Huy]]. He took his final vows on 23 September 1932, adopting the name Dominique, after the Order's founder.  He then studied theology and [[social science]] at the Pontifical International Institute ''Angelicum'', the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']] in [[Rome]], where he obtained his [[Doctor of Sacred Theology|doctorate in theology]] in 1936 with a thesis entitled ''L’Apatheia ou insensibilité irréalisable et destructrice'' (''Apatheia or unrealisable and destructive insensitivity'').<ref>[[Servais-Théodore Pinckaers|Servais Pinkaers]], [http://www.scienze-politiche.org/preaching%20Justice/pdf%20preching%20Justice/6.pdf "A Dialogue and Action for Peace: Dominique Pire  (1910–1969)"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319152335/http://www.scienze-politiche.org/preaching%20Justice/pdf%20preching%20Justice/6.pdf |date=March 19, 2009 }} in ''Preaching Justice: Dominican Contributions to Social Ethics in the Twentieth Century'', edited by Francesco Compagnoni OP and Helen Alford OP, Dublin: Dominican Publications, 2007, {{ISBN|1-905604-07-6}}, Part 1, Section B, 6, p. 137.</ref> He then returned to the Studium of La Sarte where he taught sociology.

==Career==
After completing his studies Pire returned to the priory at La Sarte, in [[Huy]], [[Belgium]] where he dedicated himself to helping poor families live according to their [[dignity]].  During the second world war, Pire served as chaplain to the Belgian resistance, actively participating in its activities, such as helping smuggle Allied pilots out of the country.  He received several medals for this service after the war.

In 1949, he began studying issues relating to postwar refugees ([[Displaced Person]]s [DP]) and wrote a book about them, entitled ''Du Rhin au Danube avec 60,000 D. P.''. He founded an organisation to help them.  The organisation established sponsorships for refugee families, and during the 1950s built a number of villages in Austria and Germany to help house many refugees.  Although a Dominican friar, Dominique Pire always refused to mix his personal faith with his commitments on behalf of the disadvantaged, a decision that was not always understood by his religious superiors.

After winning the Peace Prize, Pire also helped found a "Peace University" to raise global understanding. Later convinced that peace would not be achievable without the [[poverty reduction|eradication of poverty]], he founded "Islands of Peace", an NGO dedicated to the long term development of rural populations in developing countries. Projects were started in [[Bangladesh]] and [[India]].

Pire died at Louvain Roman Catholic Hospital on 30 January 1969 from complications following prostate surgery, at age 58.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1969/01/31/archives/dominique-pire-is-dead-at-58-priest-won-nobel-peace-prize.html Dominique Pire Is Dead at 58; Priest Won Nobel Peace Prize; Resistance Fighter Turned After War to Rescuing Displaced Persons], Associated Press (January 31, 1969)</ref>

More than 30 years after his death, the four organizations he founded are still active. In 2008 a program was established in honour of his work at the Las Casas Institute at [[Blackfriars Hall]], [[University of Oxford]].<ref>[http://www.bfriars.ox.ac.uk/casas_intro.php Las Casas Institute] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709191728/http://www.bfriars.ox.ac.uk/casas_intro.php |date=July 9, 2013 }} on Blackfriars Hall website</ref>
