The IPCC is governed by its member states, which elect a bureau of scientists to serve for the duration of an assessment cycle (usually six to seven years); the bureau selects experts nominated by governments and observer organisations to prepare IPCC reports.<ref name="Structure — IPCC">{{Cite web|title=Structure — IPCC|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/about/structure/|access-date=2021-08-10}}</ref> The IPCC is supported by a secretariat and various "Technical Support Units" from specialised working groups and task forces.<ref name="Structure — IPCC"/>

Following the election of its new bureau in 2015, the IPCC began its [[IPCC Sixth Assessment Report|sixth assessment cycle]], to be completed in 2022.

{{TOC level|3}}

== Origins and aims ==
The IPCC developed from an international scientific body, the [[Advisory Group on Greenhouse Gases]] set up in 1985 by the [[International Council for Science|International Council of Scientific Unions]], the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), and the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) to provide recommendations based on current research. This small group of scientists lacked the resources to cover the increasingly complex interdisciplinary nature of [[climate science]]. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|United States]] government sought an international convention for restrictions on [[greenhouse gas]]es, and under the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]] expressed concern about unrestrained influence from independent scientists or from United Nations bodies such as the UNEP and WMO. The U.S. government was the main force in shaping the IPCC as an autonomous intergovernmental body in which scientists took part both as experts and as official representatives of their governments, which would produce reports backed by all leading relevant scientists, and which then had to gain consensus agreement from every participating government. In this way, the IPCC was formed as a hybrid between a scientific body and an intergovernmental political organisation.<ref name="Weart international 80s" />

The United Nations formally endorsed the creation of the IPCC in 1988, citing the fact that "[c]ertain human activities could change global climate patterns, threatening present and future generations with potentially severe economic and social consequences", and that "[c]ontinued growth in atmospheric concentrations of 'greenhouse' gases could produce global warming with an eventual rise in sea levels, the effects of which could be disastrous for mankind if timely steps are not taken at all levels".<ref><!-- EDITORS FYI -- this citation format is based on https://ask.un.org/faq/14438 -->
General Assembly resolution 43/53,
[https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/43/a43r053.htm Protection of global climate for present and future generations of mankind] A/RES/43/53 (6 December 1988)</ref> To that end, the IPCC was tasked with reviewing peer-reviewed scientific literature and other relevant publications to provide information on the state of knowledge about climate change and its consequences and impacts.

== Organization ==
The IPCC does not conduct original research, but produces comprehensive assessments, reports on special topics, and methodologies based on. Its assessments build on previous reports, highlighting the trajectory towards the latest knowledge; for example, the wording of the reports from the first to the fifth assessment reflects the growing evidence for a changing climate caused by human activity.

The IPCC has adopted and published "Principles Governing IPCC Work", which states that the IPCC will assess:<ref name="Principles"/>
* the risk of [[Global warming|human-induced climate change]],
* its [[Effects of global warming|potential impacts]], and
* possible [[Climate change mitigation|options for prevention]].
Pursuant to its governing principles, the IPCC conducts its assessments on a "comprehensive, objective, open and transparent basis" that encompasses all "scientific, technical and socioeconomic information relevant to understanding the scientific basis" of climate change. IPCC reports must be neutral with respect to policy recommendations, but may address the objective scientific, technical and socioeconomic factors relevant to enacting certain policies.<ref name="Principles"/>

The IPCC is currently chaired by Korean economist [[Hoesung Lee]], who has served since 8 October 2015 with the election of the new IPCC Bureau<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/2015/06/06/ipcc-elects-hoesung-lee-of-republic-of-korea-as-chair/|title=IPCC elects Hoesung Lee of Republic of Korea as Chair — IPCC|access-date=9 August 2019}}</ref>, along with three vice-chairs, [[:fr:Youba_Sokona|Youba Sokona]] (Mali), Ko Barrett (USA) and Thelma Krug (Brazil)<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bureau Portal — IPCC|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/bureau/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-12-02|website=[[ippc]]}}</ref>. Before this election, the IPCC was led by Vice-Chair [[Ismail El Gizouli]], who was designated acting Chair after the resignation of [[Rajendra K. Pachauri]] in February 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=IPCC press release 24 February 2015: IPCC agrees on Acting Chair after R.K.

Pachauri]], elected in May 2002; [[Robert Watson (scientist)|Robert Watson]] in 1997; and [[Bert Bolin]] in 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2019/03/16th-anniversary-brochure.pdf|title = 16 Years of Scientific Assessment in Support of the Climate Convention}}</ref> The chair is assisted by an elected bureau including vice-chairs and working group co-chairs, and by a secretariat.

The Panel itself is composed of representatives appointed by governments. Participation of delegates with appropriate expertise is encouraged. Plenary sessions of the IPCC and IPCC [[Working group|Working Group]]s are held at the level of government representatives. Non-Governmental and Intergovernmental Organizations admitted as observer organizations may also attend.<ref>[https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/11/IPCC-observers.pdf LIST OF IPCC OBSERVERS ORGANIZATIONS (152 as of 16 MARCH 2018)]</ref> Sessions of the Panel, IPCC Bureau, workshops, expert and lead authors meetings are by invitation only.<ref name="Principles"/> About 500 people from 130 countries attended the 48th Session of the Panel in Incheon, Republic of Korea, in October 2018, including 290 government officials and 60 representatives of observer organizations. The opening ceremonies of sessions of the Panel and of Lead Author Meetings are open to media, but otherwise IPCC meetings are closed.

The IPCC is structured as follows:
* IPCC Panel: Meets in [[plenary session]] about once a year.<ref name="Structure — IPCC" /> It controls the organization's structure, procedures, and work programme, and accepts and approves IPCC reports. The Panel is the IPCC corporate entity.<ref name="Structure"/>
* Chair: Elected by the Panel.
* Secretariat: Oversees and manages all activities. Supported by UNEP and WMO.
* Bureau: Elected by the Panel. Chaired by the Chair. Its 34 members include IPCC Vice-Chairs, Co-Chairs of Working Groups and the Task Force, and Vice-Chairs of the Working Groups.<ref name="IPCC Bureau">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/bureau/|title=Bureau Portal — IPCC|access-date=9 August 2019}}</ref> It provides guidance to the Panel on the scientific and technical aspects of its work.<ref>{{cite web |title=Terms of Reference of the Bureau |url=https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/TOR_Bureau.pdf |access-date=25 February 2019}}</ref>
* Working Groups: Each has two Co-Chairs, one from the developed and one from developing world, and a technical support unit. Sessions of the Working Group approve the Summary for Policymakers of special reports and working group contributions to an assessment report. Each Working Group has a Bureau comprising its Co-Chairs and Vice-Chairs, who are also members of the IPCC Bureau.
** Working Group I: Assesses scientific aspects of the climate system and climate change. Co-Chairs: [[Valerie Masson-Delmotte|Valérie Masson-Delmotte]] and [[Panmao Zhai]]<ref name="IPCC Bureau"/>
** Working Group II: Assesses vulnerability of socioeconomic and natural systems to climate change, consequences, and adaptation options. Co-Chairs: Hans-Otto Pörtner and [[Debra Roberts]]<ref name="IPCC Bureau"/>
** Working Group III: Assesses options for limiting greenhouse gas emissions and otherwise mitigating climate change. Co-Chairs: Priyadarshi R. Shukla and [[James Skea|Jim Skea]]<ref name="IPCC Bureau"/>
* Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories.<ref>{{cite web |title=Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories |url=https://www.ipcc.ch/working-group/tfi/ |access-date=25 February 2019}}</ref> Co-Chairs: Kiyoto Tanabe and Eduardo Calvo Buendía
** Task Force Bureau: Comprises the two Co-Chairs, who are also members of the IPCC Bureau, and 12 members.
* Executive Committee: Comprises the Chair, IPCC Vice-Chairs and the Co-Chairs of the Working Groups and Task Force. Its role includes addressing urgent issues that arise between sessions of the Panel.<ref>{{cite web |title=IPCC Executive Committee |url=https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/09/TOR_ExComm.pdf |access-date=25 February 2019}}</ref>

=== Funding ===
The IPCC receives funding through a dedicated [[Trust Fund|trust fund]], established in 1989 by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) and the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO). The trust fund receives annual cash contributions by the WMO, UNEP, and IPCC member governments; payments are voluntary and there is no set amount required. Administrative and operational costs, such as for the secretariat and headquarters, are provided by the WMO, which also sets the IPCC's financial regulations and rules.<ref name="Appendix B to the Principles Governing IPCC Work">{{cite web |title=Financial Procedures for the IPCC |url=https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/09/ipcc-principles-appendix-b.pdf |access-date=25 February 2019}}</ref> The Panel is responsible for considering and adopting by consensus the annual budget.

==Assessment reports==
{{IPCC}}

The IPCC has published five comprehensive assessment reports reviewing the latest climate science, as well as a number of special reports on particular topics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/science_and_impacts/science/ipcc-backgrounder.html#.Vz8xcpMrIWo|title=The IPCC: Who Are They and Why Do Their Climate Reports Matter?|website=Union of Concerned Scientists|access-date=20 May 2016}}</ref> These reports are prepared by teams of relevant researchers selected by the Bureau from government nominations. Expert reviewers from a wide range of governments, IPCC observer organizations and other organizations are invited at different stages to comment on various aspects of the drafts.<ref>{{cite web|last1=IPCC|title=IPCC Factsheet: How does the IPCC review process work?|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/02/FS_review_process.pdf|website=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|publisher=IPCC|access-date=18 January 2018}}</ref>

The IPCC published its [[IPCC First Assessment Report|First Assessment Report (FAR)]] in 1990, a supplementary report in 1992, a [[IPCC Second Assessment Report|Second Assessment Report (SAR)]] in 1995, a [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|Third Assessment Report (TAR)]] in 2001, a [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|Fourth Assessment Report (AR4)]] in 2007<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/science_and_impacts/science/ipcc-backgrounder.html#.Wc5E-J_RaHt|title=The IPCC: Who Are They and Why Do Their Climate Reports Matter?|work=Union of Concerned Scientists|access-date=29 September 2017}}</ref> and a [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report|Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)]] in 2014. The IPCC is currently preparing its [[IPCC Sixth Assessment Report|Sixth Assessment Report (AR6)]], which is being released in stages and will be completed in 2022.

Each assessment report is in three volumes, corresponding to Working Groups I, II, and III. It is completed by a synthesis report that integrates the working group contributions and any special reports produced in that assessment cycle.

===Scope and preparation of the reports===
The IPCC does not carry out research nor does it monitor climate related data. Lead authors of IPCC reports assess the available information about climate change based on published sources.<ref name="Appendix A">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/09/ipcc-principles-appendix-a-final.pdf|title=Appendix A to the Principles Governing IPCC Work}}</ref><ref>IPCC. [https://www.ipcc.ch/about/ About the IPCC]</ref> According to IPCC guidelines, authors should give priority to peer-reviewed sources.<ref name="Appendix A"/> Authors may refer to non-peer-reviewed sources (the "grey literature"), provided that they are of sufficient quality.<ref name="Appendix A"/> Examples of non-peer-reviewed sources include model results, reports from government agencies and non-governmental organizations, and industry journals.<ref name="Appendix A"/> Each subsequent IPCC report notes areas where the science has improved since the previous report and also notes areas where further research is required.

There are generally three stages in the review process:<ref name="Appendix A"/>
* Expert review (6–8 weeks)
* Government/expert review
* Government review of:
** Summaries for Policymakers
** Overview Chapters
** Synthesis Report
Review comments are in an open archive for at least five years.

There are several types of endorsement which documents receive:
* Approval. Material has been subjected to detailed, line by line discussion and agreement.
** Working Group Summaries for Policymakers are ''approved'' by their Working Groups.
** Synthesis Report Summary for Policymakers is ''approved'' by Panel.
* Adoption. Endorsed section by section (and not line by line).
** Panel ''adopts'' Overview Chapters of Methodology Reports.
** Panel ''adopts'' IPCC Synthesis Report.
* Acceptance. Not been subject to line by line discussion and agreement, but presents a comprehensive, objective, and balanced view of the subject matter.
** Working Groups ''accept'' their reports.
** Task Force Reports are ''accepted'' by the Panel.
** Working Group Summaries for Policymakers are ''accepted'' by the Panel after group ''approval''.

The Panel is responsible for the IPCC and its endorsement of Reports allows it to ensure they meet IPCC standards.

There have been a range of commentaries on the IPCC's procedures, examples of which are discussed later in the article (see also [[IPCC Summary for Policymakers]]). Some of these comments have been supportive,<ref>e.g., {{Cite web

===Authors===

Each chapter has a number of authors who are responsible for writing and editing the material. A chapter typically has two "coordinating lead authors", ten to fifteen "lead authors", and a somewhat larger number of "contributing authors". The coordinating lead authors are responsible for assembling the contributions of the other authors, ensuring that they meet stylistic and formatting requirements, and reporting to the Working Group chairs. Lead authors are responsible for writing sections of chapters. Contributing authors prepare text, graphs or data for inclusion by the lead authors.<ref>{{cite web

 |title= IPCC Factsheet: How does the IPCC select its authors?
 |date= 30 August 2013
 |access-date= 12 October 2018
 }}</ref>

Authors for the IPCC reports are chosen from a list of researchers prepared by governments and participating organisations, and by the Working Group/Task Force Bureaux, as well as other experts known through their published work. The choice of authors aims for a range of views, expertise and geographical representation, ensuring representation of experts from developing and developed countries and countries with economies in transition.

== Other reports ==

===Special reports===
In addition to climate assessment reports, the IPCC publishes Special Reports on specific topics. The preparation and approval process for all IPCC Special Reports follows the same procedures as for IPCC Assessment Reports. In the year 2011 two IPCC Special Report were finalized, the Special Report on [[Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation]] (SRREN) and the Special Report on Managing Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation (SREX). Both Special Reports were requested by governments.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web |url = https://www.ipcc.ch/activities/activities.shtml |title=IPCC – Activities |publisher=Ipcc.ch |access-date=25 June 2012}}</ref>

The most prominently publicized criticism of SRES focused on the fact that all but one of the participating models compared gross domestic product (GDP) across regions using [[market exchange rate]]s (MER), instead of the more correct [[purchasing-power parity]] (PPP) approach.<ref>

====Special Report on managing the risks of extreme events and disasters to advance climate change adaptation (SREX)====
The [https://wg1.ipcc.ch/srex/ report] was published in 2012.  It assesses the effect that climate change has on the threat of natural disasters and how nations can better manage an expected change in the frequency of occurrence and intensity of severe weather patterns. It aims to become a resource for decision-makers to prepare more effectively for managing the risks of these events. A potentially important area for consideration is also the detection of trends in extreme events and the attribution of these trends to human influence. The full report, 594 pages in length, may be found [https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/srex/SREX_Full_Report.pdf here] in PDF form.

==== Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C (SR15) ====
{{anchor|1.5 Degree Report}}
{{main|Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C}}
When the [[Paris Agreement]] was adopted, the [[UNFCC]]C invited the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to write a special report on "How can humanity prevent the global temperature rise more than 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial level".<ref name="IPCC_2018_SR15">{{cite report |title=Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C |publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) |date=7 October 2018 |access-date=7 October 2018 |location=[[Incheon]], [[Republic of Korea]] |url=https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/}}</ref> The completed report, [[Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C]] (SR15), was released on 8 October 2018.

The finished report summarizes the findings of scientists, showing that maintaining a temperature rise to below 1.5&nbsp;°C remains possible, but only through "rapid and far-reaching transitions in energy, land, urban and infrastructure..., and industrial systems".<ref name=IPCC_2018_SR15/><ref name="SR15_Headlines">{{cite report |url=http://report.ipcc.ch/sr15/pdf/sr15_headline_statements.pdf |title=Headline Statements |work=Global Warming of 1.5 °C an IPCC special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty |access-date=8 October 2018 |publisher=IPCC |date=8 October 2018 |page=3 }}</ref> Meeting the Paris target of {{convert|1.5|C-change}} is possible but would require "deep emissions reductions", "rapid",<ref name="SR15_Headlines" /> "far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society".<ref name=IPCC_2018_pressrelease>{{cite report |title=Press release: Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5ºC |publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) |date=7 October 2018 |access-date=7 October 2018 |location=[[Incheon]], [[Republic of Korea]] |url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/session48/pr_181008_P48_spm_en.pdf }}</ref> In order to achieve the 1.5&nbsp;°C target, {{CO2}} emissions must decline by 45% (relative to 2010 levels) by 2030, reaching [[net zero]] by around 2050.

Under the pledges of the countries entering the Paris Accord, a sharp rise of 3.1 to 3.7&nbsp;°C is still expected to occur by 2100. Holding this rise to 1.5&nbsp;°C avoids the worst effects of a rise by even 2&nbsp;°C. However, a warming of even 1.5 degrees will still result in large-scale drought, famine, heat stress, species die-off, loss of entire ecosystems, and loss of habitable land, throwing more than 100 million into poverty. Effects will be most drastic in arid regions including the [[Middle East]] and the [[Sahel]] in Africa, where fresh water will remain in some areas following a 1.5&nbsp;°C rise in temperatures but are expected to dry up completely if the rise reaches 2&nbsp;°C.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Irfan |first1=Umair |title=A major climate report will slam the door on wishful thinking |url=https://www.vox.com/2018/10/5/17934174/climate-change-global-warming-un-ipcc-report-1-5-degrees |access-date=7 October 2018 |agency=Vox |date=6 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Global Warming of 1.5 °C an IPCC special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels and related global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate poverty |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/ |website=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate change |access-date=7 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Davenport |first1=Coral |title=Major Climate Report Describes a Strong Risk of Crisis as Early as 2040 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-climate-report-2040.html |access-date=8 October 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=7 October 2018}}</ref>

===Methodology reports===
Within IPCC the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Program develops methodologies to estimate emissions of [[greenhouse gas]]es.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/ |title=National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Program |publisher=Ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp |access-date=25 June 2012}}</ref> This has been undertaken since 1991 by the IPCC WGI in close collaboration with the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] and the [[International Energy Agency]].
The objectives of the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Program are:
* to develop and refine an internationally agreed methodology and software for the calculation and reporting of national greenhouse gas emissions and removals; and
* to encourage the widespread use of this methodology by countries participating in the IPCC and by signatories of the UNFCCC.

==== Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories ====
The 1996 Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories provide the methodological basis for the estimation of national greenhouse gas [[emission inventory|emissions inventories]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gl/invs1.html |title=Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories |publisher=Ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp |access-date=25 June 2012}}</ref> Over time these guidelines have been completed with good practice reports: ''Good Practice Guidance and Uncertainty Management in National Greenhouse Gas Inventories'' and ''Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry''.

The 1996 guidelines and the two good practice reports are to be used by parties to the UNFCCC and to the [[Kyoto Protocol]] in their annual submissions of national greenhouse gas inventories.

==== 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories ====
{{update section|date=March 2019}}
The 2006 ''IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories'' is the latest version of these emission estimation methodologies, including a large number of default emission factors.{{Clarify|date=December 2011}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/index.html |title=IPCC 2006 GLs |publisher=Ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp |access-date=25 June 2012}}</ref> Although the IPCC prepared this new version of the guidelines on request of the parties to the UNFCCC, the methods have not yet been officially accepted for use in national greenhouse gas emissions reporting under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/national_reports/annex_i_ghg_inventories/reporting_requirements/items/2759.php |title=Greenhouse Gas Emissions |publisher=Unfccc.int |date=22 February 2012 |access-date=25 June 2012}}</ref>

==Other activities==
The IPCC concentrates its activities on the tasks allotted to it by the relevant WMO Executive Council and UNEP Governing Council resolutions and decisions as well as on actions in support of the UNFCCC process.<ref name="Principles" /> While the preparation of the assessment reports is a major IPCC function, it also supports other activities, such as the Data Distribution Centre<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc-data.org/ |title=Welcome to the IPCC Data Distribution Centre |publisher=Ipcc-data.org |access-date=25 June 2012}}</ref> and the National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/ |title=IPCC – National Greenhouse Gas Inventories Programme |publisher=Ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp |access-date=25 June 2012}}</ref> required under the UNFCCC. This involves publishing default [[emission factor]]s, which are factors used to derive emissions estimates based on the levels of fuel consumption, industrial production and so on.

The IPCC also often answers inquiries from the UNFCCC Subsidiary Body for Scientific and Technological Advice (SBSTA).

Some critics have contended that the IPCC reports tend to be [[wikt:conservative|conservative]] by consistently underestimating the pace and impacts of global warming,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Scherer|first1=Glenn|title=Climate Science Predictions Prove Too Conservative|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-science-predictions-prove-too-conservative/|access-date=11 September 2017|work=Scientific American|date=6 December 2012}}</ref> and report only the "lowest common denominator" findings.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McKibben|first=Bill |date=15 March 2007 |title=Warning on Warming|journal=The New York Review of Books|volume=54|issue=4|page=18|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19981|access-date=21 February 2010|bibcode=2004Natur.427..197S|doi=10.1038/427197a|doi-access=free}}</ref>

On the eve of the publication of IPCC's [[Fourth Assessment Report]] in 2007 another study was published suggesting that temperatures and sea levels have been rising at or above the maximum rates proposed during IPCC's 2001 [[Third Assessment Report]].  The study compared IPCC 2001 projections on temperature and sea level change with observations. Over the six years studied, the actual temperature rise was near the top end of the range given by IPCC's 2001 projection, and the actual sea level rise was above the top of the range of the IPCC projection.<ref name = "BBC 1">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6321351.stm | title=Humans blamed for climate change | date=2 February 2007 | first=Richard | last=Black | work=BBC News | access-date=24 July 2007}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Rahmstorf |first1=S. |last2=Cazenave |first2=A. |last3=Church |first3=J.

Another example of scientific research which suggests that previous estimates by the IPCC, far from overstating dangers and risks, have actually understated them is a study on projected rises in sea levels. When the researchers' analysis was "applied to the possible scenarios outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the researchers found that in 2100 sea levels would be 0.5–1.4 m [50–140 cm] above 1990 levels. These values are much greater than the 9–88&nbsp;cm as projected by the IPCC itself in its Third Assessment Report, published in 2001". This may have been due, in part, to the expanding human understanding of climate.<ref name = "BBC 2">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6179409.stm | title=Sea level rise 'under-estimated' | date=14 December 2006 | work=BBC News | access-date=24 July 2007}}</ref><ref name = "Telegraph">{{cite news | title=London-on-Sea: the future of a city in decay | date=28 December 2006 | access-date=24 July 2007 | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/12/27/nlondon27.xml | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517113134/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/12/27/nlondon27.xml | url-status=dead | archive-date=17 May 2007 | first=Roger | last=Highfield | publisher=[[Telegraph.co.uk]]}}</ref>

Greg Holland from the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]], who reviewed a multi-meter [[sea level rise]] study by [[James Hansen|Jim Hansen]], noted "''There is no doubt that the sea level rise, within the IPCC, is a very conservative number, so the truth lies somewhere between IPCC and Jim.''"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/07/23/controversial-sea-level-rise-paper-is-now-published-online/|title=James Hansen's controversial sea level rise paper has now been published online|year=2015|newspaper=Washington Post}}</ref>

In reporting criticism by some scientists that IPCC's then-impending January 2007 report understates certain risks, particularly sea level rises, an AP story quoted [[Stefan Rahmstorf]], professor of physics and oceanography at Potsdam University as saying "In a way, it is one of the strengths of the IPCC to be very conservative and cautious and not overstate any climate change risk".<ref>{{cite web|title=Climate change: The scientific basis |date=5 February 2007 |access-date=24 July 2007 |url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070129/ipcc_faq_070129/20070129?hub=SciTech |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205051907/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070129/ipcc_faq_070129/20070129?hub=SciTech |url-status=dead |archive-date=5 February 2007 |publisher=[[CTV Television Network]]}}</ref>

In his December 2006 book, ''[[Hell and High Water: Global Warming]]'', and in an interview on [[Fox News]] on 31 January 2007, energy expert [[Joseph Romm]] noted that the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] is already out of date and omits recent observations and factors contributing to global warming, such as the release of greenhouse gases from thawing tundra.<ref>[http://climateprogress.org/2007/02/01/climate-progress-on-fox-news/ Fox interview]{{Unreliable source?|date=February 2010}}</ref>

Political influence on the IPCC has been documented by the release of a memo by ExxonMobil to the Bush administration, and its effects on the IPCC's leadership.

The IPCC process on climate change and its efficiency and success has been compared with dealings with other environmental challenges (compare [[Ozone depletion and global warming]]). In case of the [[Ozone depletion]], global regulation based on the [[Montreal Protocol]] has been successful. In case of Climate Change, the [[Kyoto Protocol]] failed.<ref name=cass>[http://law.vanderbilt.edu/files/archive/Sunstein-2008.pdf Of Montreal and Kyoto: A Tale of Two Protocols] by [[Cass Sunstein]] 38 ELR 10566 8/2008</ref> The Ozone case was used to assess the efficiency of the IPCC process.<ref name = RG>{{Cite web|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/faces/viewItemFullPage.jsp;jsessionid=1F12495443EF6AC95BFF12F29F3C4829?itemId=escidoc%3A1235032%3A2&view=EXPORT|title=book summary at the Max Planck Gesellschaft, in German|access-date=9 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141012202222/http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/faces/viewItemFullPage.jsp;jsessionid=1F12495443EF6AC95BFF12F29F3C4829?itemId=escidoc%3A1235032%3A2&view=EXPORT|archive-date=12 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Outdatedness of reports====
Since the IPCC does not carry out its own research, it operates on the basis of scientific papers and independently documented results from other scientific bodies, and its schedule for producing reports requires a deadline for submissions prior to the report's final release. In principle, this means that any significant new evidence or events that change our understanding of climate science between this deadline and publication of an IPCC report cannot be included. In an area of science where our scientific understanding is rapidly changing, this has been raised as a serious shortcoming in a body which is widely regarded as the ultimate authority on the science.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.carbonequity.info/PDFs/Arctic.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201040652/http://www.carbonequity.info/PDFs/Arctic.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Example of concerns over outdatedness of IPCC reports, see p. 3|archive-date=1 December 2007|access-date=9 August 2019}}</ref> However, there has generally been a steady evolution of key findings and levels of [[confidence interval|scientific confidence]] from one assessment report to the next.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2021-08-09|title=Climate change: Five things we have learned from the IPCC report|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58138714|access-date=2021-08-12}}</ref>

The submission deadlines for the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) differed for the reports of each Working Group. Deadlines for the Working Group I report were adjusted during the drafting and review process in order to ensure that reviewers had access to unpublished material being cited by the authors. The final deadline for cited publications was 24 July 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ipcc-wg1.ucar.edu/wg1/docs/PublicationDeadlines_2006-07-01.pdf|title=Guidelines for inclusion of recent scientific literature in the Working Group I Fourth Assessment Report.|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226215326/http://ipcc-wg1.ucar.edu/wg1/docs/PublicationDeadlines_2006-07-01.pdf|archive-date=26 February 2008}}</ref> The final WG I report was released on 30 April 2007 and the final AR4 Synthesis Report was released on 17 November 2007.[[Rajendra Pachauri]], the IPCC chair, admitted at the launch of this report that since the IPCC began work on it, scientists have recorded "much stronger trends in climate change", like the unforeseen dramatic melting of polar ice in the summer of 2007,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.carbonequity.info/docs/arctic.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925172830/http://www.carbonequity.info/docs/arctic.html|url-status=dead|title=Carbon Equity report on the Arctic summer of 2007|archive-date=25 September 2010|access-date=9 August 2019}}</ref> and added, "that means you better start with intervention much earlier".<ref>{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/18/world/europe/18iht-climate.2.8378031.html|title=Alarming UN report on climate change too rosy, many say |last=Rosenthal |first=Elisabeth|author2=Kanter, James|date=18 November 2007 |newspaper=New York Times|access-date=22 February 2010}}</ref>

==== Burden on participating scientists ====
Scientists who participate in the IPCC assessment process do so without any compensation other than the normal salaries they receive from their home institutions. The process is labor-intensive, diverting time and resources from participating scientists' research programs.<ref>{{Cite book | title=Analysis of Global Change Assessments: Lessons Learned | author1=Committee on Analysis of Global Change Assessments| author2=Board on Atmospheric Sciences and Climate | author3=Division of Earth and Life Sciences | access-date=24 July 2007 | year=2007 | publisher=[[National Academies Press]] | url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11868.html#toc | isbn=978-0309104852}}</ref> Concerns have been raised that the large uncompensated time commitment and disruption to their own research may discourage qualified scientists from participating.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Climate Change Science: An Analysis of Some Key Questions |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10139 |publisher=[[National Academies Press]] |isbn=978-0309075749 |first1=Ralph J. |last1=Cicerone |first2=Eric J. |last2=Barron |first3=Robert E. |last3=Dickinson |first4=Inez Y. |last4=Fung |first5=James E. |last5=Hansen |first6=Thomas R. |last6=Karl |first7=Richard S. |last7=Lindzen |first8=James C. |last8=McWilliams |first9=F.

==== Lack of error correction after publication ====
In May 2010, Pachauri noted that the IPCC currently had no process for responding to errors or flaws once it issued a report. The problem, according to Pachauri, was that once a report was issued the panels of scientists producing the reports were disbanded.<ref name="ReferenceA">[[Associated Press]], "U.N. climate chief welcomes review, defends work", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 16 May 2010, p. 5.</ref>

==== Proposed organizational overhaul ====
In February 2010, in response to controversies regarding claims in the [[AR4|Fourth Assessment Report]],<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/environment/climate-change/top-scientists-call-for-overhaul-of-un-climate-panel-20100211-nt95.html |title=Top scientists call for overhaul of UN climate panel |access-date=11 February 2010 |newspaper=[[Brisbane Times]]|date=10 February 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.nzherald.co.nz/environment/news/article.cfm?c_id=39&objectid=10625605 |title=Climate panel facing calls to restructure |access-date=11 February 2010 |last= Gibson|first= Eloise|date= 12 February 2010|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]}}</ref> five climate scientists – all contributing or lead IPCC report authors – wrote in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' calling for changes to the IPCC. They suggested a range of new organizational options, from tightening the selection of lead authors and contributors, to dumping it in favor of a small permanent body, or even turning the whole climate science assessment process into a [[Internet Forum#Moderators|moderated]] "living" Wikipedia-IPCC.<!-- That last line ought to interest this community! --><ref name="nature_100211">{{cite web|title=Nature TOC 2010-02-11, volume 463 number 7282, opinions|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v463/n7282/#op}} 100211 nature.com</ref><ref name="theaustralian_overhaul">{{cite news|title=Scientists say IPCC should be overhauled or scrapped|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/scientists-say-ipcc-should-be-overhauled-or-scrapped/story-e6frg6nf-1225828951315 | work=The Australian | first=Leigh|last=Dayton|date=11 February 2010}} 100211 theaustralian.com.au</ref> Other recommendations included that the panel employ a full-time staff and remove government oversight from its processes to avoid political interference.<ref>[[Agence France-Presse]]-[[Jiji Press]], "[http://news.theage.com.au/breaking-news-world/un-climate-panel-needs-fix-scientists-20100211-nsuy.html UN climate panel needs fix: scientists]", ''[[The Age]]'', 11 February 2010.</ref>

====Reframing of scientific research====
The 2018 report ''What Lies Beneath'' by the [[Breakthrough – National Centre for Climate Restoration]] urges the IPCC, the wider UNFCCC negotiations, and national policy makers to change their approach. The authors note, "We urgently require a reframing of scientific research within an existential risk-management framework."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.breakthroughonline.org.au/publications|title=The Scientific Understatement Of Climate Risks|year=2018|work=[[Breakthrough Institute]]}}</ref>

== Reviews ==

===InterAcademy Council review===
In March 2010, at the invitation of the United Nations secretary-general and the chair of the IPCC, the [[InterAcademy Council]] (IAC) was asked to review the IPCC's processes for developing its reports.<ref>{{cite news |title=Scientists to review climate body |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8561004.stm |work=BBC News |date=10 March 2010 |access-date=4 April 2010 |first=Richard |last=Black}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=UN Requests IAC Review of IPCC |url=http://www.interacademycouncil.net/CMS/News/12852.aspx |publisher=InterAcademy Council |access-date=31 August 2010}}</ref> The IAC panel, chaired by [[Harold Tafler Shapiro]], convened on 14 May 2010 and released its report on 1 September 2010.<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref>{{cite web |title=InterAcademy Council Report Recommends Fundamental Reform of IPCC Management Structure |publisher=InterAcademy Council |work=Review of the IPCC |date=30 August 2010 |url=http://reviewipcc.interacademycouncil.net/ReportNewsRelease.html |access-date=31 August 2010}}</ref>

The IAC found that, "The IPCC assessment process has been successful overall". The panel, however, made seven formal recommendations for improving the IPCC's assessment process, including:
# establish an executive committee;
# elect an executive director whose term would only last for one assessment;
# encourage review editors to ensure that all reviewer comments are adequately considered and genuine controversies are adequately reflected in the assessment reports;
# adopt a better process for responding to reviewer comments;
# working groups should use a qualitative level-of-understanding scale in the Summary for Policy Makers and Technical Summary;
# "Quantitative probabilities (as in the likelihood scale) should be used to describe the probability of well-defined outcomes only when there is sufficient evidence"; and
# implement a communications plan that emphasizes transparency and establish guidelines for who can speak on behalf of the organization.<ref>{{cite web |title=Climate Change Assessments: Review of the processes and procedures of the IPCC |publisher=InterAcademy Council |date=n.d. |url=http://reviewipcc.interacademycouncil.net/report/Executive%20Summary%20and%20Front%20Matter.pdf |access-date=1 September 2010}}</ref>
The panel also advised that the IPCC avoid appearing to advocate specific policies in response to its scientific conclusions.<ref>{{cite news |last=MacFarquhar |first=Neil |title=Review Finds Flaws in U.N.
