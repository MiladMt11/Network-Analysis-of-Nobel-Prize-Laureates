==Biography ==

=== Origin and education ===
[[File:Portrait of François Marie de Broglie, Duke of Broglie, Marshal of France (member of the circle of Hyacinthe Rigaud).jpg|thumb|[[François-Marie, 1st duc de Broglie]] (1671–1745) ancestor of Louis de Broglie and [[Marshal of France]] under [[Louis XIV of France]]]]

Louis de Broglie belonged to the famous aristocratic family of [[House of Broglie|Broglie]], whose representatives for several centuries occupied important military and political posts in France. The father of the future physicist, [[Victor, 5th duc de Broglie|Louis-Alphonse-Victor, 5th duc de Broglie]], was married to Pauline d’Armaille, the granddaughter of the Napoleonic General [[Philippe Paul, comte de Ségur]]. They had five children; in addition to Louis, these are: Albertina (1872–1946), subsequently the Marquise de Luppé; [[Maurice de Broglie|Maurice]] (1875–1960), subsequently a famous experimental physicist; Philip (1881–1890), who died two years before the birth of Louis, and Pauline, Comtesse de Pange (1888–1972), subsequently a famous writer.<ref name="Nye">{{cite journal |author = M.

As the youngest child in the family, Louis grew up in relative loneliness, read a lot, and was fond of history, especially political. From early childhood, he had a good memory and could accurately read an excerpt from a theatrical production or give a complete list of ministers of the [[Third Republic of France]]. For him was predicted a great future as a statesman.<ref name="Abragam">{{cite journal |author = [[Anatole Abragam|A.

De Broglie had intended a career in [[humanities]], and received his first degree in history. Afterwards he turned his attention toward mathematics and physics and received a degree in physics.  With the outbreak of the [[First World War]] in 1914, he offered his services to the army in the development of radio communications.

=== Military service ===

After graduation, Louis de Broglie as a simple sapper joined the engineering forces to undergo compulsory service. It began at [[Fort Mont Valérien]], but soon, on the initiative of his brother, he was seconded to the Wireless Communications Service and worked on the [[Eiffel Tower]], where the radio transmitter was located. Louis de Broglie remained in military service throughout the [[First World War]], dealing with purely technical issues. In particular, together with [[Léon Brillouin]] and brother Maurice, he participated in establishing wireless communications with submarines. Prince Louis was demobilized in August 1919 with the rank of [[adjudant]]. Later, the scientist regretted that he had to spend about six years away from the fundamental problems of science that interested him.<ref name="Abragam" /><ref name="Dict">{{cite journal |author = J.

=== Scientific and pedagogical career ===
His 1924 thesis ''Recherches sur la théorie des quanta''<ref>{{cite web |last1=de Broglie |first1=Louis Victor |title=On the Theory of Quanta |url=http://aflb.ensmp.fr/LDB-oeuvres/De_Broglie_Kracklauer.pdf |website=Foundation of Louis de Broglie |edition= English translation by A.F. Kracklauer, 2004. |access-date=2 January 2020}}</ref> (Research on the Theory of the Quanta) introduced his theory of [[electron]] waves. This included the [[wave–particle duality]] theory of matter, based on the work of [[Max Planck]] and [[Albert Einstein]] on light. This research culminated in the [[Matter wave|de Broglie hypothesis]] stating that ''any moving particle or object had an associated wave''. De Broglie thus created a new field in physics, the ''mécanique ondulatoire,'' or wave mechanics, uniting the physics of energy (wave) and matter (particle). For this he won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1929.

In his later career, de Broglie worked to develop a [[causality (physics)|causal]] explanation of wave mechanics, in opposition to the wholly [[probabilistic]] models which dominate [[quantum mechanical]] theory; it was refined by [[David Bohm]] in the 1950s. The theory has since been known as the [[De Broglie–Bohm theory]].

In addition to strictly scientific work, de Broglie thought and wrote about the [[philosophy of science]], including the value of modern scientific discoveries.

De Broglie became a member of the [[Académie des sciences]] in 1933, and was the academy's perpetual secretary from 1942. He was asked to join ''Le Conseil de l'Union Catholique des Scientifiques Francais'', but declined because he was non-religious.<ref>{{cite book|title=Quantum Mechanics at the Crossroads: New Perspectives From History, Philosophy And Physics|year=2007|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783540326632|first1=James |last1=Evans |first2=Alan S. |last2=Thorndike|page=71|quote=Asked to join Le Conseil de l'Union Catholique des Scientifiques<!-- the source has "Sceintifiques", but that is a typo --> Français, Louis declined because, he said, he had ceased the religious practices of his youth.}}</ref><ref>Kimball, John (2015).

On 12 October 1944, he was elected to the [[Académie Française]], replacing mathematician [[Émile Picard]]. Because of the deaths and imprisonments of Académie members during the occupation and other effects of the war, the Académie was unable to meet the quorum of twenty members for his election; due to the exceptional circumstances, however, his unanimous election by the seventeen members present was accepted. In an event unique in the history of the Académie, he was received as a member by his own brother Maurice, who had been elected in 1934. [[UNESCO]] awarded him the first [[Kalinga Prize]] in 1952 for his work in popularizing scientific knowledge, and he was elected a Foreign Member of the [[Royal Society]] on 23 April 1953.

Louis became the 7th [[duc de Broglie]] in 1960 upon the death without heir of his elder brother, [[Maurice, 6th duc de Broglie]], also a physicist.

In 1961, he received the title of Knight of the Grand Cross in the [[Légion d'honneur]]. De Broglie was awarded a post as counselor to the French High Commission of Atomic Energy in 1945 for his efforts to bring industry and science closer together. He established a center for applied mechanics at the [[Henri Poincaré Institute]], where research into optics, cybernetics, and atomic energy were carried out. He inspired the formation of the [[International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science]] and was an early member.<ref name="PiecuchMaruani2009">{{cite book|author1=Piotr Piecuch|author2=Jean Maruani|author3=Gerardo Delgado-Barrio|author4=Stephen Wilson|title=Advances in the Theory of Atomic and Molecular Systems: Conceptual and Computational Advances in Quantum Chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1qbgc17K1dAC|date=30 September 2009|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-90-481-2596-8|page=4}}</ref> His funeral was held 23 March 1987 at the Church of Saint-Pierre-de-Neuilly.<ref name="NéelBroglie1988">{{cite book|author1=Louis Néel|author2=Fondation Louis de Broglie|author3=Conservatoire national des arts et métiers (France)|title=Louis de Broglie que nous avons connu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C0u4AAAAIAAJ|year=1988|publisher=Fondation Louis de Broglie, Conservatoire national des arts et métiers}}</ref>

=== Physics of X-ray and photoelectric effect ===
The first works of Louis de Broglie (early 1920s) were performed in the laboratory of his [[Maurice de Broglie|older brother Maurice]] and dealt with the features of the [[photoelectric effect]] and the properties of [[x-rays]]. These publications examined the absorption of X-rays and described this phenomenon using the [[Bohr theory]], applied quantum principles to the interpretation of [[Photoemission spectroscopy|photoelectron spectra]], and gave a systematic classification of X-ray spectra.<ref name="Abragam" /> The studies of X-ray spectra were important for elucidating the structure of the internal electron shells of atoms (optical spectra are determined by the outer shells). Thus, the results of experiments conducted together with Alexandre Dauvillier, revealed the shortcomings of the existing schemes for the distribution of electrons in atoms; these difficulties were eliminated by [[Edmund Stoner]].<ref>''The Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics: The Interpretations of Quantum Mechanics in Historical Perspective''. New York: Wiley-Interscience, 1974. {{ISBN|0-471-43958-4}}</ref> Another result was the elucidation of the insufficiency of the Sommerfeld formula for determining the position of lines in X-ray spectra; this discrepancy was eliminated after the discovery of the electron spin. In 1925 and 1926, Leningrad physicist [[Orest Khvolson]] nominated the de Broglie brothers for the Nobel Prize for their work in the field of X-rays.<ref name="Nye" />

=== Matter and wave–particle duality ===
{{Main|De Broglie hypothesis}}
Studying the nature of X-ray radiation and discussing its properties with his brother Maurice, who considered these rays to be some kind of combination of waves and particles, contributed to Louis de Broglie's awareness of the need to build a theory linking particle and wave representations. In addition, he was familiar with the works (1919–1922) of [[Marcel Brillouin]], which proposed a hydrodynamic model of an atom and attempted to relate it to the results of Bohr's theory. The starting point in the work of Louis de Broglie was the idea of A. Einstein about the [[Photon|quanta of light]]. In his first article on this subject, published in 1922, the French scientist considered blackbody radiation as a gas of light quanta and, using classical statistical mechanics, derived the [[Wien approximation|Wien radiation law]] in the framework of such a representation. In his next publication, he tried to reconcile the concept of light quanta with the phenomena of interference and diffraction and came to the conclusion that it was necessary to associate a certain periodicity with quanta. In this case, light quanta were interpreted by him as relativistic particles of very small mass.<ref name="Mehra">{{cite journal |author = J. Mehra. |editor= J. Mehra. |title= Louis de Broglie and the phase waves associated with matter |edition= The Golden Age of Theoretical Physics  |date=  2001 |year= 2001 |publisher= World Scientific |pages = 546–570 }}</ref>

It remained to extend the wave considerations to any massive particles, and in the summer of 1923 a decisive breakthrough occurred. De Broglie outlined his ideas in a short note "Waves and quanta" ({{lang-fr|Ondes et quanta}}, presented at a meeting of the Paris Academy of Sciences on September 10, 1923), which marked the beginning of the creation of wave mechanics. In this paper, the scientist suggested that a moving particle with energy '''E''' and velocity '''v''' is characterized by some internal periodic process with a frequency <math>E/h</math>, where <math>h</math> is [[Planck's constant]]. To reconcile these considerations, based on the quantum principle, with the ideas of special relativity, de Broglie was forced to associate a "fictitious wave" with a moving body, which propagates with the velocity <math>c^2/v</math>. Such a wave, which later received the name phase, or [[de Broglie wave]], in the process of body movement remains in phase with the internal periodic process. Having then examined the motion of an electron in a closed orbit, the scientist showed that the requirement for phase matching directly leads to the quantum [[Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization|Bohr-Sommerfeld condition]], that is, to quantize the angular momentum. In the next two notes (reported at the meetings on September 24 and October 8, respectively), de Broglie came to the conclusion that the particle velocity is equal to the [[group velocity]] of phase waves, and the particle moves along the normal to surfaces of equal phase. In the general case, the trajectory of a particle can be determined using [[Fermat's principle]] (for waves) or the [[principle of least action]] (for particles), which indicates a connection between geometric optics and classical mechanics.<ref>[[Max Jammer]] ''The Conceptual Development of Quantum Mechanics''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1966 2nd ed: New York: American Institute of Physics, 1989. {{ISBN|0-88318-617-9}}</ref>

This theory set the basis of wave mechanics. It was supported by Einstein, confirmed by the [[Davisson–Germer experiment|electron diffraction experiments]] of G P Thomson and Davisson and Germer, and generalized by the work of [[Schrödinger]].

However, this generalization was statistical and was not approved of by de Broglie, who said "that the particle must be the seat of an internal periodic movement and that it must move in a wave in order to remain in phase with it was ignored by the actual [[physicists]] [who are] wrong to consider a wave propagation without localization of the particle, which was quite contrary to my original ideas."

From a philosophical viewpoint, this theory of matter-waves has contributed greatly to the ruin of the atomism of the past. Originally, de Broglie thought that real wave (i.e., having a direct physical interpretation) was associated with particles. In fact, the wave aspect of matter was formalized by a [[wavefunction]] defined by the [[Schrödinger equation]], which is a pure mathematical entity having a probabilistic interpretation, without the support of real physical elements. This wavefunction gives an appearance of wave behavior to matter, without making real physical waves appear. However, until the end of his life de Broglie returned to a direct and real physical interpretation of matter-waves, following the work of [[David Bohm]]. The [[de Broglie–Bohm theory]] is today the only interpretation giving real status to matter-waves and representing the predictions of quantum theory.

=== {{Anchor|de Broglie internal clock}} Conjecture of an internal clock of the electron ===
In his 1924 thesis, de Broglie conjectured that the electron has an internal clock that constitutes part of the mechanism by which a [[pilot wave]] guides a particle.<ref>See for example the description of de Broglie's view in: David Bohm, Basil Hiley: ''The de Broglie pilot wave theory and the further development and new insights arising out of it'', Foundations of Physics, volume 12, number 10, 1982, Appendix: On the background of the papers on trajectories interpretation, by D. Bohm, ([http://leopard.physics.ucdavis.edu/rts/p298/pilotwavetheory.pdf PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819234038/http://leopard.physics.ucdavis.edu/rts/p298/pilotwavetheory.pdf |date=19 August 2011 }})</ref> Subsequently, [[David Hestenes]] has proposed a link to the [[zitterbewegung]] that was suggested by [[Erwin Schrödinger]].<ref>D. Hestenes, October 1990, The Zitterbewegung interpretation of quantum mechanics, Foundations of Physics, vol.&nbsp;20, no.&nbsp;10, pp.&nbsp;1213–1232</ref>

While attempts at verifying the internal clock hypothesis and measuring clock frequency are so far not conclusive,<ref>See for example G.R. Osche, ''Electron channeling resonance and de Broglie's internal clock'', Annales de la Fondation Louis de Broglie, vol.&nbsp;36, 2001, pp.&nbsp;61–71 ([http://aflb.ensmp.fr/AFLB-361/aflb361m718.pdf full text])</ref> recent experimental data is at least compatible with de Broglie's conjecture.<ref>Catillon, Foundations of Physics, July 2001, vol.&nbsp;38, no.&nbsp;7, pp.&nbsp;659–664</ref>

=== Non-nullity and variability of mass ===
According to de Broglie, the [[neutrino]] and the [[photon]] have rest masses that are non-zero, though very low. That a photon is not quite massless is imposed by the coherence of his theory. Incidentally, this rejection of the hypothesis of a massless photon enabled him to doubt the hypothesis of the expansion of the universe.

In addition, he believed that the true mass of particles is not constant, but variable, and that each particle can be represented as a [[thermodynamic]] machine equivalent to a cyclic integral of action.

=== Generalization of the principle of least action ===
In the second part of his 1924 thesis, de Broglie used the equivalence of the mechanical principle of least action with [[Fermat's principle|Fermat's optical principle]]: "Fermat's principle applied to phase waves is identical to [[Maupertuis' principle]] applied to the moving body; the possible dynamic trajectories of the moving body are identical to the possible rays of the wave." This equivalence had been pointed out by [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]] a century earlier, and published by him around 1830, in an era where no experience gave proof of the fundamental principles of physics being involved in the description of atomic phenomena.

Up to his final work, he appeared to be the physicist who most sought that dimension of action which [[Max Planck]], at the beginning of the 20th century, had shown to be the only universal unity (with his dimension of entropy).

=== Duality of the laws of nature ===
Far from claiming to make "the contradiction disappear" which [[Max Born]] thought could be achieved with a statistical approach, de Broglie extended wave–particle duality to all particles (and to crystals which revealed the effects of diffraction) and extended the principle of duality to the laws of nature.

His last work made a single system of laws from the two large systems of thermodynamics and of mechanics:
{{quote|When [[Boltzmann]] and his continuators developed their statistical interpretation of Thermodynamics, one could have considered Thermodynamics to be a complicated branch of Dynamics. But, with my actual ideas, it's Dynamics that appear to be a simplified branch of Thermodynamics. I think that, of all the ideas that I've introduced in quantum theory in these past years, it's that idea that is, by far, the most important and the most profound.}}
That idea seems to match the continuous–discontinuous duality, since its dynamics could be the limit of its thermodynamics when transitions to continuous limits are postulated. It is also close to that of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], who posited the necessity of "architectonic principles" to complete the system of mechanical laws.

However, according to him, there is less duality, in the sense of opposition, than synthesis (one is the limit of the other) and the effort of synthesis is constant according to him, like in his first formula, in which the first member pertains to mechanics and the second to optics:
: <math> m c^2 = h \nu </math>

=== Neutrino theory of light ===
{{main|Neutrino theory of light}}
This theory, which dates from 1934, introduces the idea that the photon is equivalent to the fusion of two [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]] [[neutrinos]]. A recently published paper confirms this assertion. This is available at https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijleo.2021.168061

It shows that the movement of the center of gravity of these two particles obeys the [[Maxwell equations]]—that implies that the neutrino and the photon both have rest masses that are non-zero, though very low.

=== Hidden thermodynamics ===
De Broglie's final idea was the hidden thermodynamics of isolated particles. It is an attempt to bring together the three furthest principles of physics: the principles of Fermat, Maupertuis, and [[Carnot's theorem (thermodynamics)|Carnot]].

In this work, [[Action (physics)|action]] becomes a sort of opposite to [[entropy]], through an equation that relates the only two universal dimensions of the form:
:<math>{\text{action}\over h} = -{\text{entropy}\over k}</math>
As a consequence of its great impact, this theory brings back the [[uncertainty principle]] to distances around extrema of action, distances corresponding to ''reductions in entropy''.
