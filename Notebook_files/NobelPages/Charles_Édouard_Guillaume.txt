'''Charles Édouard Guillaume''' (15 February 1861, in [[Fleurier]], Switzerland – 13 May 1938, in [[Sèvres]], France) was a Swiss physicist who received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1920 in recognition of the service he had rendered to precision measurements in [[physics]] by his discovery of anomalies in nickel steel alloys.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1920/guillaume/facts/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1920|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-27}}</ref> In 1919, he gave the fifth [[Institute of Physics Michael Faraday Medal and Prize|Guthrie Lecture]] at the Institute of Physics in London with the title "The Anomaly of the Nickel-Steels".<ref>{{cite journal

== Personal life ==
Charles-Edouard Guillaume was born in [[Fleurier, Switzerland]], on February 15, 1861.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1920/guillaume/biographical/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1920|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-27}}</ref> Guillaume received his early education in [[Neuchâtel]], and obtained a doctoral degree in Physics at [[ETH Zurich]] in 1883.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://history.aip.org/phn/11710005.html|title=Guillaume, Ch.-Ed.

Guillaume was married in 1888 to A.M. Taufflieb, with whom he had three children. <ref name=":0" />

== Scientific career ==
Guillaume was head of the [[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]].<ref name="Gould">Gould, p.201.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hautehorlogerie.org/en/encyclopaedia/famous-watchmakers/s/charles-edouard-guillaume/|title=Charles-Edouard Guillaume - Fondation de la Haute Horlogerie|website=www.hautehorlogerie.org|access-date=2019-02-27}}</ref> He also worked with [[Kristian Birkeland]], serving at the [[Observatoire de Paris]]—Section de Meudon. He conducted several [[experiment]]s with [[thermostatic]] measurements at the [[observatory]].   

=== Nickel-steel alloy ===
Guillaume is known for his discovery of nickel-steel alloys he named [[invar]] and [[elinvar]].  Invar has a near-zero [[coefficient of thermal expansion]], making it useful in constructing precision instruments whose dimensions need to remain constant in spite of varying temperature.  Elinvar has a near-zero thermal coefficient of the [[modulus of elasticity]], making it useful in constructing instruments with springs that need to be unaffected by varying temperature, such as the [[marine chronometer]].  Elinvar is also non-magnetic, which is a secondary useful property for [[antimagnetic watch]]es. 

=== Space radiation ===
Guillaume is also known for the ''earliest'' estimation of the "radiation of the stars” in his 1896 paper "La Température de L'Espace (The Temperature of Space)". This publication made him a pioneer in [[plasma cosmology]], the study of conditions far from any particular star.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20120716224844/http://public.lanl.gov/alp/plasma/people/history.html Pioneers in the development of the plasma cosmology]</ref> The concept would later be known as the [[Cosmic microwave background]].<ref>Guillaume, C.-É., 1896, ''La Nature'' 24, series 2, p. 234, cited in [https://www.ifi.unicamp.br/~assis/Apeiron-V2-p79-84(1995).pdf "History of the 2.7&nbsp;K Temperature Prior to Penzias and Wilson" (PDF)]</ref> He was one of the first people in history to estimate the temperature of space, as 5-6[[Kelvin|K]].<ref>Guillaume, C.-É., 1896, ''La Nature'' 24, series 2, p. 234, cited in [https://www.ifi.unicamp.br/~assis/Apeiron-V2-p79-84(1995).pdf "History of the 2.7&nbsp;K Temperature Prior to Penzias and Wilson" (PDF)]</ref>

=== Horology ===
As the son of a Swiss [[horologist]], Guillaume took an interest in [[Marine chronometer|marine chronometers]]. For use as the [[compensation balance]] he developed a slight variation of the invar alloy which had a negative quadratic coefficient of expansion.  The purpose of doing this was to eliminate the "middle temperature" error of the balance wheel.<ref name="Gould" /> The ''Guillaume Balance'' (a type of [[balance wheel]]) in [[horology]] is named after him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.phillips.com/detail/PATEK-PHILIPPE/CH080217/190|title=Phillips: CH080217, Patek Philippe|website=Phillips|language=en|access-date=2019-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qrgfAQAAMAAJ&q=Guillaume+Balance&pg=PA109|title=Scientific American Monthly|last1=Bond|first1=Alexander Russell|year=1921}}</ref>
