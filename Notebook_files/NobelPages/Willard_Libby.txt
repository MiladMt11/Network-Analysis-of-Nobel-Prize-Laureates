'''Willard Frank Libby''' (December 17, 1908 – September 8, 1980) was an American [[physical chemistry|physical chemist]] noted for his role in the 1949 development of [[radiocarbon dating]], a process which revolutionized [[archaeology]] and [[palaeontology]]. For his contributions to the team that developed this process, Libby was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1960.

A 1931 chemistry graduate of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], from which he received his doctorate in 1933, he studied radioactive elements and developed sensitive [[Geiger counter]]s to measure weak natural and artificial radioactivity. During [[World War II]] he worked in the [[Manhattan Project]]'s Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories at [[Columbia University]], developing the [[gaseous diffusion]] process for [[uranium enrichment]].

After the war, Libby accepted professorship at the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Institute for Nuclear Studies]], where he developed the technique for dating organic compounds using [[carbon-14]]. He also discovered that [[tritium]] similarly could be used for dating water, and therefore wine. In 1950, he became a member of the General Advisory Committee (GAC) of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC). He was appointed a commissioner in 1954, becoming its sole scientist. He sided with [[Edward Teller]] on pursuing a crash program to develop the [[hydrogen bomb]], participated in the [[Atoms for Peace]] program, and defended the administration's atmospheric [[nuclear testing]].

Libby resigned from the AEC in 1959 to become Professor of Chemistry at [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA), a position he held until his retirement in 1976.  In 1962, he became the Director of the [[University of California]] statewide Institute of [[Geophysics]] and Planetary Physics (IGPP).  He started the first Environmental Engineering program at UCLA in 1972, and as a member of the [[California Air Resources Board]], he worked to develop and improve California's air pollution standards.

==Early life and career==

==Manhattan Project==
On December 8, 1941, the day after the [[Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] brought the United States into [[World War II]], Libby volunteered his services to Nobel Prize laureate [[Harold Urey]]. Urey arranged for Libby to be given leave from the University of California, Berkeley and to join him at [[Columbia University]] to work on the [[Manhattan Project]], the wartime project to develop [[atomic bomb]]s,<ref name="Nobelprize.org"/><ref name="TIME" /> at what became its Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|p=128}} During his time in the New York City area, Libby was a resident of [[Leonia, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01EFDF113CF936A25755C0A961958260 |title=Well-Read, Well-Shaded and Well-Placed |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 15, 1997 |access-date=March 30, 2011 |quote=Much later, its residents included five Nobel Prize winners, among them Enrico Fermi, one of the developers of the atomic bomb, and Willard Libby, who discovered radiocarbon dating; Sammy Davis Jr., Pat Boone and Alan Alda, the entertainers, and Robert Ludlum, the author }}</ref>

Over the next three years, Libby worked on the [[gaseous diffusion]] process for [[uranium enrichment]].{{sfn|Carey|2006|pp=231–232}} An atomic bomb required [[fissile]] material, and the fissile [[uranium-235]] made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. The SAM Laboratories therefore had to find a way of separating kilograms of it from the more abundant [[uranium-238]]. Gaseous diffusion worked on the principle that a lighter gas diffuses through a barrier faster than a heavier one at a rate inversely proportional to its molecular weight. But the only known gas containing uranium was the highly corrosive [[uranium hexafluoride]], and a suitable barrier was hard to find.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=29–31}}

Through 1942, Libby and his team studied different barriers and the means to protect them from corrosion from the uranium hexafluoride.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=99–100}} The most promising type was a barrier made of powdered [[nickel]] developed by Edward O. Norris of the Jelliff Manufacturing Corporation and Edward Adler from the [[City College of New York]], which became known as the "Norris-Adler" barrier by late 1942.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=101, 126}}

In addition to developing a suitable barrier, the SAM Laboratories also had to assist in the design of a gaseous separation plant, which became known as [[K-25]]. Libby helped with the engineers from [[Kellex]] to produce a workable design for a pilot plant.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=121–124}} Libby conducted a series of tests that indicated that the Norris-Adler barrier would work, and he remained confident that with an all-out effort, the remaining problems with it could be solved. Although doubts remained, construction work began on the K-25 full-scale production plant in September 1943.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=130–134}}

As 1943 gave way to 1944, many problems remained. Tests began on the machinery at K-25 in April 1944 without a barrier. Attention turned to a new process developed by Kellex. Finally, in July 1944, Kellex barriers began to be installed in K-25.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=137–141}} K-25 commenced operation in February 1945, and as cascade after cascade came online, the quality of the product increased. By April 1945, K-25 had attained a 1.1% enrichment.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=167–171}} Uranium partially enriched in K-25 was fed into the [[calutron]]s at [[Y-12 National Security Complex|Y-12]] to complete the enrichment process.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=159–160}}

Construction of the upper stages of the K-25 plant was cancelled, and Kellex was directed to instead design and build a 540-stage side feed unit, which became known as K-27.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=158–165}} The last of K-25's 2,892 stages commenced operation in August 1945.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=167–171}}   On August 5, K-25 starting producing feed enriched to 23 percent uranium-235.{{sfn|Jones|1985|p=148}} K-25 and K-27 achieved their full potential only in the early postwar period, when they eclipsed the other production plants and became the prototypes for a new generation of plants.{{sfn|Jones|1985|pp=167–171}} Enriched uranium was used in the [[Little Boy]] bomb employed in the [[bombing of Hiroshima]] on August 6, 1945.{{sfn|Hewlett|Anderson|1962|pp=401–403}} Libby brought home a stack of newspapers and told his wife,  "This is what I've been doing."<ref name="TIME" />

==Radiocarbon dating==
After the war, Libby accepted an offer from the [[University of Chicago]] of a professorship in the Chemistry Department at the new [[Institute for Nuclear Studies]].<ref name="Nobelprize.org"/> He returned to his pre-war studies of radioactivity.{{sfn|Carey|2006|pp=231–232}} In 1939, Serge Korff had discovered that [[cosmic rays]] generated [[neutron]]s in the upper atmosphere. These interact with [[nitrogen-14]] in the air to produce [[carbon-14]]:

He also developed sensitive radiation detectors that could use the technique. Tests against [[Sequoia (genus)|sequoia]] with known dates from their tree rings showed [[radiocarbon dating]] to be reliable and accurate. The technique revolutionised [[archaeology]], [[palaeontology]] and other disciplines that dealt with ancient artefacts.{{sfn|Carey|2006|pp=231–232}} In 1960, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] "for his method to use carbon-14 for age determination in archaeology, geology, geophysics, and other branches of science".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1960/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1960 |publisher=Nobel Foundation |access-date = July 27, 2015 }}</ref> He also discovered that [[tritium]] similarly could be used for dating water, and therefore wine.<ref name="Nobel lecture" />

==Atomic Energy Commission==
[[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC) Chairman [[Gordon Dean (lawyer)|Gordon Dean]] appointed Libby to its influential General Advisory Committee (GAC) in 1950. In 1954, he was appointed an AEC commissioner by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] on the recommendation of Dean's successor, [[Lewis Strauss]]. Libby and his family moved from Chicago to [[Washington, D.C.]] He brought with him a truckload of scientific equipment, which he used to establish a laboratory at the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institution]] there to continue his studies of [[amino acid]]s. Staunchly conservative politically, he was one of the few scientists who sided with [[Edward Teller]] rather than [[Robert Oppenheimer]] during the debate on whether it was wise to pursue a crash program to develop the [[hydrogen bomb]].<ref name="TIME" /> As a commissioner, Libby played an important role in promoting Eisenhower's [[Atoms for Peace]] program,{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|pp=92–95}} and was part of the United States delegation at the Geneva Conferences on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in 1955 and 1958.<ref name="TIME" />{{sfn|Hewlett|Holl|1989|p=446}}

As the only scientist among the five AEC commissioners, it fell to Libby to defend the Eisenhower administration's stance on atmospheric [[nuclear testing]].{{sfn|Hewlett|Holl|1989|pp=278–279}} He argued that the dangers of radiation from nuclear tests were less than that from chest X-rays, and therefore less important than the risk of having an inadequate nuclear arsenal, but his arguments failed to convince the scientific community or reassure the public.{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|pp=92–95}}{{sfn|Greene|2007|p=65}} In January 1956, he publicly revealed the existence of [[Project SUNSHINE|Project Sunshine]], a series of research studies to ascertain the impact of radioactive fallout on the world's population that he had initiated in 1953 while serving on the GAC.<ref>{{cite web |first=Alice |last=Buck |title=The Atomic Energy Commission |date=July 1983 |publisher=[[United States Department of Energy]] |url=http://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/AEC%20History.pdf |access-date=July 29, 2015 }}</ref> By 1958, even Libby and Teller were supporting limits on atmospheric nuclear testing.{{sfn|Hewlett|Holl|1989|pp=542–543}}

==UCLA==
Libby resigned from the AEC in 1959, he became Professor of Chemistry at University of California, Los Angeles, a position he held until his retirement in 1976. He taught honors freshman chemistry. In 1962, he became the Director of the University of California statewide Institute of [[Geophysics]] and Planetary Physics (IGPP), a position he also held until 1976. His time as director encompassed the [[Apollo space program]] and the lunar landings. {{sfn|Carey|2006|pp=231–232}}<ref name="UC" />

Libby started the first Environmental Engineering program at UCLA in 1972.<ref name="UC" /> As a member of the [[California Air Resources Board]], he worked to develop and improve California's air pollution standards.{{sfn|Seaborg|1981|pp=92–95}} He established a research program to investigate [[heterogeneous catalysis]] with the idea of reducing emissions from motor vehicles through more complete fuel combustion.<ref name="UC"/> The election of [[Richard Nixon]] as president in 1968 generated speculation that Libby might be appointed as Presidential Science Advisor. There was a storm of protest from scientists who felt that Libby was too conservative, and the offer was not made.<ref name="obit"/>

Although Libby retired and became a [[professor emeritus]] in 1976,<ref name="UC"/> he remained professionally active until his death in 1980.{{sfn|Magill|1989|pp=703–712}}

==Awards and honors==
Libby was an elected member of the [[National Academy of Sciences]], the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and the [[American Philosophical Society]].{{sfn|Magill|1989|pp=703–712}} In addition to the Nobel Prize, he received numerous honors and awards, including Columbia University's Chandler Medal in 1954,<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[Columbia Daily Spectator]] |url=http://spectatorarchive.library.columbia.edu/cgi-bin/columbia?a=d&d=cs19540216-01.2.11&e=-------en-20--65004--txt-txIN-Columbia-ARTICLE---- |title=To Award Chandler Medal Tomorrow To Chicago Chemist |volume=XCVIII |issue=66 |date=February 16, 1954  |access-date=July 29, 2015 }}</ref> the Remsen Memorial Lecture Award in 1955, the Bicentennial Lecture Award from the [[City College of New York]] and the Nuclear Applications in Chemistry Award in 1956, the [[Franklin Institute]]'s [[Elliott Cresson Medal]] in 1957, the [[American Chemical Society]]'s [[Willard Gibbs Award]] in  1958, the [[Joseph Priestley Award]] from [[Dickinson College]] and the [[Albert Einstein Medal]] in 1959, the [[Geological Society of America]]'s [[Arthur L.
