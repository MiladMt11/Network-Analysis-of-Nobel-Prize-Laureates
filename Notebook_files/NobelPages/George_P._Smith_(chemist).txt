==Career==
Born in [[Norwalk, Connecticut]], he earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] degree from [[Haverford College]] in biology, was a high school teacher and lab technician for a year, and earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in bacteriology and immunology from [[Harvard University]].<ref name="thesis-smith-1971">{{cite thesis |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/302618673/ |title=The variation and adaptive expression of antibodies |date=1971 |publisher=[[Harvard University]] |type=PhD |last=Smith |first=George Pearson |via=[[ProQuest]] |url-access=subscription |oclc=76998014|pmc=1445740 }}</ref> He was a postdoc at the [[University of Wisconsin]] (with future Nobel laureate [[Oliver Smithies]]) before moving to Columbia, Missouri and joining the University of Missouri faculty in 1975. He spent the 1983–1984 academic year at [[Duke University]] with Robert Webster where he began the work that led to him being awarded a Nobel Prize.<ref>{{cite web|title = Tropical and Molecular Parasitology Seminar Series| url=http://tmp.wustl.edu/archives/TMPFall2004/seminars2004.html|access-date=3 October 2018}}</ref><ref name="Smith_1985">{{cite journal | author = Smith GP | title = Filamentous fusion phage: novel expression vectors that display cloned antigens on the virion surface | journal = Science | volume = 228 | issue = 4705 | pages = 1315–7 |date=June 1985 | pmid = 4001944 | doi = 10.1126/science.4001944 |bibcode = 1985Sci...228.1315S }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title = 2018 Nobel Prize winner did much of his work at Duke University| url=https://abc11.com/science/2018-nobel-prize-winner-did-much-of-his-work-at-duke/4402640/|access-date=3 October 2018| date=3 October 2018}}</ref><ref name="'My first standing ovation': Humble MU professor cheered after winning Nobel Prize" /><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1qCum7pWOFwC&q=phage+display+duke&pg=PA21|title=Phage Display of Peptides and Proteins: A Laboratory Manual|date=1996|publisher=Academic Press, Inc.|isbn=978-0-12-402380-2|language=en}}</ref>

He is best known for [[phage display]], a technique where a specific [[protein]] sequence is artificially inserted into the [[Viral coat protein|coat protein]] gene of a [[bacteriophage]], causing the protein to be expressed on the outside of the bacteriophage. Smith first described the technique in 1985 when he displayed [[peptide]]s on [[filamentous phage]] by fusing the peptide of interest onto gene III of filamentous phage.<ref name="Smith_1985"/> He was awarded the 2018 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for this work, sharing his prize with [[Greg Winter]] and [[Frances Arnold]].

== Human rights advocacy ==
Smith is an advocate for equal rights for Palestinians and Israeli Jews in their common homeland, and a strong supporter of the [[Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions]] movement.<ref>{{cite news | last =Kaplan Sommer| first =Allison | title =Nobel Prize Winner George P.
