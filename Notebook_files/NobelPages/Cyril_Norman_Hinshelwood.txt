'''Sir Cyril Norman Hinshelwood''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OM|PRS}} (19 June 1897 – 9 October 1967) was a British [[physical chemist]] and a [[Nobel Prize]] laureate.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Cullis | first1 = C.

==Education==
Born in London, his parents were Norman Macmillan Hinshelwood, a chartered accountant, and Ethel Frances née Smith. He was educated first in Canada, returning in 1905 on the death of his father to a small flat in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] where he lived for the rest of his life. He then studied at [[Westminster City School]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford]].

==Career==
During the [[First World War]], Hinshelwood was a [[chemist]] in an [[explosive material|explosives]] factory. He was a [[tutor]] at [[Trinity College, Oxford]] from 1921 to 1937 and was Dr Lee's Professor of [[Chemistry]] at the [[University of Oxford]] from 1937. He served on several Advisory Councils on scientific matters to the [[British Government]].

His early studies of molecular [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]] led to the publication of ''Thermodynamics for Students of Chemistry'' and ''The Kinetics of Chemical Change'' in 1926. With [[Harold Warris Thompson]] he studied the explosive reaction of [[hydrogen]] and [[oxygen]] and described the phenomenon of [[chain reaction]]. His subsequent work on chemical changes in the bacterial cell proved to be of great importance in later research work on [[antibiotics]] and therapeutic agents, and his book, ''The Chemical Kinetics of the Bacterial Cell'' was published in 1946, followed by ''Growth, Function and Regulation in Bacterial Cells'' in 1966. In 1951 he published ''The Structure of Physical Chemistry''. It was republished as an Oxford Classic Texts in the Physical Sciences by Oxford University Press in 2005.

The [[Reactions on surfaces|Langmuir-Hinshelwood]] process in heterogeneous catalysis, in which the adsorption of the reactants on the surface is the rate-limiting step, is named after him. He was a senior research fellow at [[Imperial College London]] from 1964 to 1967.

==Awards and honours==
Hinshelwood was elected [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1929|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1929]],<ref name="frs"/> serving as President from 1955 to 1960. He was [[knight]]ed in 1948 and appointed to the [[Order of Merit]] in 1960. With [[Nikolay Nikolayevich Semyonov|Nikolay Semenov]] of the USSR, Hinshelwood was jointly awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1956 for his researches into the mechanism of chemical reactions.

Hinshelwood was President of the [[Chemical Society]], the [[Royal Society]],<ref name="frs">{{Cite journal | last1 = Thompson | first1 = H. | doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1973.0015|title = Cyril Norman Hinshelwood 1897–1967 | journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 19 | pages = 375–431|year = 1973|pmid =  11615727| s2cid = 12385145 }}</ref> the [[Classical Association]], and the [[Faraday Society]], and received numerous awards and honorary degrees.

==Personal life==
Hinshelwood never married. He was fluent in seven classical and modern languages and his main hobbies were painting, collecting Chinese pottery, and foreign literature.

He died, at home, on 9 October 1967. In 1968 his Nobel Prize medal was sold by his estate to a collector, who then sold it in 1976 for $15,000.<ref>{{cite news| title=Nashua Telegraph | date=8 March 1976 | page=20 | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&dat=19760308&id=FZ4rAAAAIBAJ&pg=2448,1340703 }}</ref> In 2017 his Nobel Prize medal was sold at auction for $128,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/lifestyle/house-home/collectors-corner/555021/scientists-prize-winning-work-revealed-rare-nobel-medal/|title=Scientists prize-winning work revealed by rare Nobel medal|first=Norman|last=Watson}}</ref>
