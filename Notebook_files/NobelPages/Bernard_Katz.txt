He shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine]] in 1970 with [[Julius Axelrod]] and [[Ulf von Euler]]. He was made a [[Knight Bachelor]] in 1969.

==Life and career==
Katz was born in [[Leipzig]], Germany, to a Jewish family originally from Russia, the son of Eugenie (Rabinowitz) and Max Katz, a fur merchant.<ref name="nobelprize.org">{{Cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1970/katz-bio.html |title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1970}}</ref> He was educated at the Albert Gymnasium in that city from 1921 to 1929 and went on to study medicine at the [[University of Leipzig]]. He graduated in 1934 and fled to Britain in February 1935.

Katz went to work at [[University College London]], initially under the tutelage of [[Archibald Vivian Hill]]. He finished his PhD in 1938 and won a [[Carnegie Fellowship]] to study with [[John Carew Eccles]] at the Kanematsu Institute of [[Sydney Medical School]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/medicine/research/units/kanematsu.php|title=Archived copy |access-date=10 November 2014|url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110050316/http://sydney.edu.au/medicine/research/units/kanematsu.php |archive-date=10 November 2014 }}</ref> During this time, both he and Eccles gave research lectures at the [[University of Sydney]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/australias-nobel-laureates |title=Archived copy |access-date=14 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814115156/http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/australias-nobel-laureates |archive-date=14 August 2014 |url-status = dead}}</ref> He obtained British nationality in 1941<ref>{{Cite ODNB|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-61415|title=Katz, Sir Bernard (1911–2003), experimental physiologist|year=2004|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/61415|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> and joined the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] in 1942. He spent the war in the Pacific as a [[radar]] officer and in 1946 was invited back to UCL as an assistant director by [[A V Hill|Hill]]. For three years until 1949, the Katz family lived with [[A V Hill|Hill]] and his wife [[Margaret Hill (social reformer)|Margaret]] in the top flat of their house in [[Highgate]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Top of the Hill: A History of the Hill Homes|last=Kosky|first=Jules.|date=1994|publisher=Hill Homes|isbn=0-9523659-0-1}}. p.85</ref>

Back in England he also worked with the 1963 Nobel prize winners [[Alan Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Huxley]]. Katz was made a professor at UCL in 1952 and head of biophysics, he was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1952|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1952]].<ref name="frs"/> He stayed as head of biophysics until 1978 when he became emeritus professor.

Katz married Marguerite Penly in 1945. He died in London on 20 April 2003, at the age of 92. His son Jonathan<ref name="nobelprize.org"/> is [[Public Orator]] of The [[University of Oxford]].

==Research==
His research uncovered fundamental properties of [[synapse]]s, the junctions across which nerve cells signal to each other and to other types of cells. By the 1950s, he was studying the biochemistry and action of [[acetylcholine]], a [[neurotransmitter|signalling molecule]] found in synapses linking [[motor neuron]]s to [[muscle]]s,<ref>The Release of Neural Transmitter Substances (The Sherrington Lectures X), Charles C Thomas Publisher, Springfield (Illinois) 1969, pp.&nbsp;60</ref> used to stimulate contraction. Katz won the Nobel for his discovery with [[Paul Fatt]] that neurotransmitter release at synapses is "[[Quantal neurotransmitter release|quantal]]", meaning that at any particular synapse, the amount of neurotransmitter released is never less than a certain amount, and if more is always an integral number times this amount. Scientists now understand that this circumstance arises because, prior to their release into the synaptic gap, transmitter molecules reside in like-sized subcellular packages known as [[synaptic vesicle]]s, released in a similar way to any other [[vesicle (biology)|vesicle]] during [[exocytosis]].

Katz's work had immediate influence on the study of [[organophosphate]]s and [[organochlorine]]s, the basis of new post-war study for [[nerve agent]]s and [[pesticide]]s, as he determined that the complex enzyme cycle was easily disrupted.
