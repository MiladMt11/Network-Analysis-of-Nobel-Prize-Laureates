'''Otto Fritz Meyerhof''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɔto ˈmaɪ̯ɐˌhoːf|-|De-Otto Meyerhof.ogg}}; April 12, 1884 – October 6, 1951) was a German [[physician]] and [[biochemist]] who won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine]] in 1922.<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Anon| doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(51)91682-0 | title = Obituary: Otto Fritz Meyerhof | journal = The Lancet | volume = 258 | issue = 6687 | pages = 790–792 | year = 1951 | pmid =  14874513}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1922/meyerhof-bio.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1922 |access-date=2011-01-11 |quote=Otto Fritz Meyerhof was born on April 12, 1884, in Hannover. He was the son of Felix Meyerhof, a merchant of that city and his wife Bettina May. Soon after his birth his family moved to Berlin, where he went to the Wilhelms Gymnasium (classical secondary school). Leaving school at the age of 14, he was attacked, at the age of 16, by kidney trouble and had to spend a long time in bed. During this period of enforced inactivity he was much influenced by his mother's constant companionship. He read much, wrote poetry, and went through a period of much artistic and mental development. After he had matriculated, he studied medicine at Freiburg, Berlin, Strasbourg, and Heidelberg. |publisher=[[Nobel Prize]] }}</ref>

==Biography==
Otto Fritz Meyerhof was born in [[Hannover]], at Theaterplatz 16A (now:Rathenaustrasse 16A),<ref>[[Walter Selke]] and Christian Heppner, ''The family of the Nobel Prize recipient Otto Meyerhof in Hannover'', in: Hannoversche Geschichtsblaetter 71 (2017), p.156-166; {{ISBN|978-3-86525-602-7}}</ref><ref name=con2>{{cite web|url=http://www.uni-kiel.de/grosse-forscher/index.php?nid=meyerhof&lang=e|title=Uni Kiel – Otto Fritz Meyerhof |publisher=Uni-kiel.de |access-date=2017-06-26}}</ref> the son of wealthy [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish]] parents. In 1888, his family moved to [[Berlin]], where Otto spent most of his childhood, and where he started his study of [[medicine]]. He continued these studies in [[University of Strasbourg|Strasbourg]] and [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]], from which he graduated in 1909, with a work titled "Contributions to the Psychological Theory of Mental Illness". In Heidelberg, he met Hedwig Schallenberg. They married in 1914
and became parents of a daughter, Bettina, and two sons, Gottfried (who referred, after emigration, to himself as Geoffrey) as well as Walter.

In 1912, Otto Meyerhof moved to the [[University of Kiel]], where he received a professorship in 1918. In 1922, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]], with [[Archibald Vivian Hill]], for his work on muscle metabolism, including [[glycolysis]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Kresge | first1 = N. | last2 = Simoni | first2 = R.
