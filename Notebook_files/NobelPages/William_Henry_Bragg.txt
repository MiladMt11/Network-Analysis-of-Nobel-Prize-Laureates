==Biography==
[[File:Market Harborough Grammar School.jpg|235px|right|thumb|The Old Grammar School, [[Market Harborough]], which has a plaque inside noting Bragg's attendance.]]

===Early years===
Bragg was born at [[Westward, Cumbria|Westward]], near [[Wigton]], [[Cumberland]], England, the son of Robert John Bragg, a merchant marine officer and farmer, and his wife Mary née Wood, a clergyman's daughter. When Bragg was seven years old, his mother died, and he was raised by his uncle, also named William Bragg, at [[Market Harborough]], [[Leicestershire]]. He was educated at the [[Robert Smyth Academy|Grammar School]] there, at [[King William's College]] on the [[Isle of Man]] and, having won an [[exhibition (scholarship)]], at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He graduated in 1884 as third [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|wrangler]], and in 1885 was awarded a first class honours in the mathematical [[tripos]].<ref>{{acad|id=BRG880WH|name=Bragg, William Henry}}</ref><ref name=dab>{{Dictionary of Australian Biography | First=William Henry | Last=Bragg | shortlink=0-dict-biogBr-By.html#bragg1 | access-date=7 October 2008 }}</ref><ref name=adb>{{Australian Dictionary of Biography | last=Tomlin | first=S.

===University of Adelaide===
In 1885,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article208372343 |title=The New Elder Professor of Mathematics. |newspaper=[[The Express and Telegraph]] |volume=XXIII |issue=6,596 |location=South Australia |date=18 December 1885 |access-date=11 February 2018 |page=2 (Afternoon Edition.) |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> at the age of 23, Bragg was appointed (Sir Thomas) [[Elder Professor of Mathematics]] and Experimental Physics in the [[University of Adelaide]],<ref>[http://www.physics.adelaide.edu.au/history/BraggCentenary.htm Bragg Centenary, 1886–1986], University of Adelaide, Pages 3 & 4. Proof of advertisement in the Oxford University Gazette of 16 October 1885, and the Cambridge University Reporter of 13 October 1885. The advertisements read:
:THE UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE
:ELDER PROFESSOR OF MATHEMATICS AND EXPERIMENTAL PHYSICS
:The Council invite applications for the above Professorship. Salary £800 per annum. The appointment will be for a term of five years, subject to renewal at the discretion of the Council. Salary will date from March&nbsp;1, 1886, and the Professor will be expected to enter on his duties on that date. An allowance will be made for travelling expenses. Applications with testimonials should reach ... not later than December&nbsp;1, 1885.
Bragg was informed of his appointment by a letter dated 17 December 1885.</ref> Australia, and started work there early in 1886.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article36320906 |title=THE ADELAIDE UNIVERSITY. |newspaper=[[The South Australian Advertiser]] |volume=XXVIII |issue=8500 |date=15 January 1886 |access-date=11 February 2018 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Being a skilled mathematician, at that time he had limited knowledge of physics, most of which was in the form of applied mathematics he had learnt at Trinity. Also at that time, there were only about a hundred students doing full courses at Adelaide, of whom less than a handful belonged to the science school, whose deficient teaching facilities Bragg improved by apprenticing himself to a firm of instrument makers. Bragg was an able and popular lecturer; he encouraged the formation of the student union, and the attendance, free of charge, of science teachers at his lectures.<ref name=dab/><ref name=adb/>

Bragg's interest in physics developed, particularly in the field of electromagnetism. <!-- In his early years, he spent a year at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] taking the equivalent of an undergraduate course.{{cn|date=November 2010}} --> In 1895, he was visited by [[Ernest Rutherford]], en route from New Zealand to Cambridge; this was the commencement of a lifelong friendship. Bragg had a keen interest in the new discovery of X-rays by [[Wilhelm Röntgen]]. On 29 May 1896 at Adelaide, Bragg demonstrated before a meeting of local doctors the application of "X-rays to reveal structures that were otherwise invisible". [[Samuel Barbour]], senior chemist of [[F. H. Faulding & Co.]], an Adelaide pharmaceutical manufacturer, supplied the necessary apparatus in the form of a [[Crookes tube]], a glass discharge tube. The tube had been obtained at Leeds, England, where Barbour visited the firm of [[Reynolds and Branson]], a manufacturer of photographic and laboratory equipment. Barbour returned to Adelaide in April 1896. Barbour had conducted his own experiments shortly after return to Australia, but results were limited due to limited battery power.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article199894315 |title=RONTGEN PHOTOGRAPHY UNSUSPECTED. |newspaper=[[Evening Journal (Adelaide)|Evening Journal]] |volume=XXVIII |issue=7976 |location=Adelaide |date=30 May 1896 |access-date=11 February 2018 |page=7 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> At the University, the tube was attached to an induction coil and a battery borrowed from Sir [[Charles Todd (pioneer)|Charles Todd]], Bragg's father-in-law. The induction coil was utilized to produce the electric spark necessary for Bragg and Barbour to "generate short bursts of X-rays". The audience was favorably impressed. Bragg availed himself as a test subject, in the manner of Röntgen and allowed an X-ray photograph to be taken of his hand. The image of the fingers in his hand revealed "an old injury to one of his fingers sustained when using the turnip chopping machine on his father's farm in Cumbria".<ref>George, Robert.

As early as 1895, Professor William H. (later Sir William) Bragg was working on wireless telegraphy, though public lectures and demonstrations focussed on his X-ray research which would later lead to his Nobel Prize. In a hurried visit by Rutherford, he was reported as working on a Hertzian oscillator. There were many common practical threads to the two technologies and he was ably assisted in the laboratory by Arthur Lionel Rogers who manufactured much of the equipment. On 21 September 1897 Bragg gave the first recorded public demonstration of the working of wireless telegraphy in Australia during a lecture meeting at the University of Adelaide as part of the Public Teachers' Union conference.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article54509107 |title=PUBLIC TEACHERS' UNION. |newspaper=[[South Australian Register]] |volume=LXII |issue=15,869 |date=22 September 1897 |access-date=8 February 2018 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article162381651 |title=SECOND DAY. |newspaper=[[Adelaide Observer]] |volume=LIV |issue=2,921 |date=25 September 1897 |access-date=8 February 2018 |page=14 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> Bragg departed Adelaide in December 1897,<ref name=":0">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article209126386 |title=THE LATE MR.

At the same time Bragg's interests were leaning towards X-rays and practical work in wireless in South Australia was largely dormant for the next decade.

The turning-point in Bragg's career came in 1904 when he gave the presidential address to section A of the [[Australasian Association for the Advancement of Science]] at [[Dunedin]], New Zealand,<ref name=adb/> on "Some Recent Advances in the Theory of the Ionization of Gases". This idea was followed up "in a brilliant series of researches"<ref name=adb/> which, within three years, earned him a fellowship of the [[Royal Society]] of London. This paper was also the origin of his first book ''Studies in Radioactivity'' (1912). Soon after the delivery of his 1904 address, some [[radium bromide]] was made available to Bragg for experimentation. In December 1904 his paper "On the Absorption of α Rays and on the Classification of the α Rays from Radium" appeared in the ''[[Philosophical Magazine]]'', and in the same issue a paper "On the Ionization Curves of Radium", written in collaboration with his student [[Richard Kleeman]], also appeared.<ref name=dab/><ref name=adb/>

At the end of 1908, Bragg returned to England. During his 23 years in Australia "he had seen the number of students at the University of Adelaide almost quadruple, and had a full share in the development of its excellent science school."<ref name=dab/> He had returned to England on the maiden voyage of the [[SS Waratah|SS ''Waratah'']], a ship which vanished at sea on its second voyage the next year. He had been alarmed at the ship's tendency to list during his voyage, and had concluded that the ship's [[metacentric height|metacentre]] was just below her [[centre of gravity]]. In 1911, he testified his belief that the ''Waratah'' was unstable at the Inquiry into the ship's disappearance.<ref name="NLAInqreport">{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5235069 |title=THE WARATAH.

===University of Leeds===

[[Image:X-ray spectrometer, 1912. (9660569929).jpg|235px|thumb|X-ray spectrometer developed by Bragg]]
Bragg occupied the Cavendish chair of physics at the [[University of Leeds]] from 1909 until 1915. He continued his work on X-rays with much success. He invented the [[X-ray spectrometer]] and with his son, Lawrence Bragg, then a research student at Cambridge, founded the new science of [[X-ray crystallography]], the analysis of crystal structure using X-ray diffraction.

===World War I===

Both of his sons were called into the army after war broke out in 1914 .<ref>{{cite book|last1=Van der Kloot|first1=William|title=Great Scientists wage the Great War|date=2014|publisher=Fonthill|location=Stroud|pages=93–128}}</ref> The following year he was appointed [[Quain Professor]] of physics at [[University College London]].<ref name=dab/> He had to wait for almost a year to contribute to the war effort: finally, in July 1915, he was appointed to the [[Board of Invention and Research]] set up by the Admiralty.<ref name=dab/> In September, his younger son Robert died of wounds at Gallipoli. In November, he shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with elder son William Lawrence. The Navy was struggling to prevent sinkings by unseen, submerged U boats. The scientists recommended that the best tactic was to listen for the submarines. The Navy had a [[hydrophone]] research establishment at [[Aberdour]] Scotland, staffed with navy men. In November 1915, two young physicists were added to its staff. Bowing to outside pressure for using science, in July 1916, the Admiralty appointed Bragg as scientific director at Aberdour, assisted by three additional young physicists. They developed an improved directional hydrophone, which convinced the Admiralty of their usefulness. Late in 1916, Bragg with his small group moved to [[Harwich]], where the staff was enlarged and they had access to a submarine for tests. In France, where scientists had been mobilized since the beginning of the war, the physicist [[Paul Langevin]] made a major stride with echolocation, generating intense sound pulses with quartz sheets oscillated at high frequency, which were then used as microphones to listen for echoes. Quartz was usable when vacuum tubes became available at the end of 1917 to amplify the faint signals. The British made [[sonar]] practicable by using mosaics of small quartz bits rather than slices from a large crystal. In January 1918, Bragg moved into the Admiralty as head of scientific research in the anti-submarine division. By war's end British vessels were being equipped with [[sonar]] manned by trained listeners.

Inspired by William Lawrence's methods for locating enemy guns by [[sound ranging|the sound of their firing]], the output from six microphones miles apart along the coast were recorded on moving photographic film. [[Artillery sound ranging|Sound ranging]] is much more accurate in the sea than in the turbulent atmosphere. They were able to localize the sites of distant explosions, which were used to obtain the precise positions of British warships and of minefields.

===University College London===
After the war he returned to University College London, where he continued to work on crystal analysis.<ref name=dab/>

===Royal Institution===
From 1923, he was [[Fullerian Professor of Chemistry]] at the [[Royal Institution]] and director of the Davy Faraday Research Laboratory.<ref name="DFRL">[https://web.archive.org/web/20120211202445/http://www.rigb.org/contentControl?action=displayContent&id=00000000046 William Henry Bragg (1862–1942)].

The Royal Society compiled a register of qualified men. They proposed a small committee on science to advise the Committee on Imperial Defence, but this was rejected. Finally in 1940, as Bragg's term ended, a Scientific Advisory Committee to the War Cabinet was appointed. Bragg died in 1942.

==Honours and awards==
Bragg was joint winner with his son, [[Lawrence Bragg]], of the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1915: ''"For their services in the analysis of [[crystal structure]] by means of [[X-ray]]"''.<ref name = "NobelBragg">{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1915 |publisher=Nobel Foundation |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1915/index.html |access-date=2018-04-26}}</ref>

Bragg was elected [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1907, vice-president in 1920, and served as [[President of the Royal Society]] from 1935 to 1940. He was elected as a member of the [[Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium]] on 1 June 1946.

He was appointed [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (CBE) in 1917 and Knight Commander ([[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire|KBE]]) in the [[1920 New Year Honours|1920 civilian war honours]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=31840|supp=y| page=3758|date=30 March 1920}}</ref> He was admitted to the [[Order of Merit]] in 1931.<ref name=dab/>

==Private life==
In 1889, in Adelaide, Bragg married Gwendoline Todd, a skilled water-colour painter, and daughter of astronomer, meteorologist and electrical engineer [[Charles Todd (astronomer)|Sir Charles Todd]].<ref name=dab/><ref name=adb/> They had three children, a daughter, Gwendolen and two sons, [[Lawrence Bragg|William Lawrence]], born in 1890 in North Adelaide, and Robert. Gwendolen married the English architect [[Alban Caroe]], Bragg taught William at the University of Adelaide, and Robert was killed in the [[Battle of Gallipoli]]. Bragg's wife, Gwendoline, died in 1929.

Bragg played tennis and golf, and as a founding member of the [[North Adelaide Lacrosse Club|North Adelaide]] and [[Adelaide University Lacrosse Club]]s, contributed to the introduction of [[lacrosse]] to South Australia and was also the secretary of the Adelaide University Chess Association.<ref>[http://www.physics.adelaide.edu.au/history/BraggCentenary.htm Bragg Centenary, 1886–1986], University of Adelaide, page 43.</ref>

Bragg died in 1942 in England and was survived by his daughter Gwendolen and his son, Lawrence.

==Legacy==
The lecture theatre of [[King William's College]] (KWC) is named in memory of Bragg; the Sixth-Form invitational literary debating society at KWC, the Bragg Society, is also named in his memory. One of the school "Houses" at Robert Smyth School, Market Harborough, Leicester, is named "Bragg" in memory of him being a student there. Since 1992, the Australian Institute of Physics has awarded The Bragg Gold Medal for Excellence in Physics for the best [[PhD]] thesis by a student at an [[List of universities in Australia|Australian university]]. The two sides of the medal contain the images of Sir William Henry and his son Sir Lawrence Bragg.<ref>{{cite web | title=Bragg Gold Medal for Excellence in Physics | url=http://www.aip.org.au/content/bragg | publisher=Australian Institute of Physics | year=2009 | access-date=11 January 2009}}</ref>

The Experimental Technique Centre at [[Brunel University]] is named the Bragg Building. The Sir William Henry Bragg Building at the [[University of Leeds]] opened in 2021. 

In 1962, the Bragg Laboratories were constructed at the University of Adelaide to commemorate 100 years since the birth of Sir William H. Bragg.<ref name=dab/>
