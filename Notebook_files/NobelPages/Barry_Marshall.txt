'''Barry James Marshall''' {{postnominals|country=AUS|AC|FRACP|FRS|FAA}}<ref name=barryswho/><ref name=frs/> (born 30 September 1951) is an Australian physician, [[Nobel Prize Laureate in Physiology or Medicine]], Professor of Clinical [[Microbiology]] and Co-Director of the Marshall Centre<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Marshall Centre|url=https://www.uwa.edu.au/marshall-centre|url-status=live|access-date=3 May 2021|website=The Marshall Centre}}</ref> at the [[University of Western Australia]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The University of Western Australia|url=https://www.uwa.edu.au/home|url-status=live}}</ref> Marshall and [[Robin Warren]] showed that the bacterium ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' (''H. pylori'') plays a major role in causing many [[peptic ulcer]]s, challenging decades of medical doctrine holding that ulcers were caused primarily by stress, spicy foods, and too much acid.

==Education and early life==
Marshall was born in [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia|Kalgoorlie]], Western Australia and lived in Kalgoorlie and [[Carnarvon, Western Australia|Carnarvon]] until moving to [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] at the age of eight. His father held various jobs, and his mother was a nurse. He is the eldest of four siblings. He attended [[Newman College, Perth|Newman College]] for his secondary education and the [[University of Western Australia School of Medicine]], where he received a [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS)]] in 1974.<ref name=barryswho/>  He married his wife Adrienne in 1972 and has four children.<ref name=autobiography>{{cite web | last =Barry | first =Marshall | title =Autobiography | publisher =[[Nobel Foundation]] | year =2005 | url =http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2005/marshall-autobio.html | access-date = 28 January 2007 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070218061329/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2005/marshall-autobio.html| archive-date= 18 February 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref><ref>

In 1972 he was also a state [[yo-yo]] champion.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vianet.net.au/~bjmrshll/features2.html |title=Sydney Morning Herald Features Barry Marshall Helicobacter pylori |publisher=Vianet.net.au |date=2 August 1997 |access-date=2 March 2010}}</ref>

==Career and research==
In 1979, Marshall was appointed Registrar in Medicine at the [[Royal Perth Hospital]]. He met Dr. [[Robin Warren]], a pathologist interested in [[gastritis]], during internal medicine fellowship training at Royal Perth Hospital in 1981. Together, the pair studied the presence of spiral bacteria in association with gastritis. In 1982, they performed the initial culture of ''H. pylori'' and developed their hypothesis on the bacterial cause of peptic ulcers and gastric cancer.<ref name=autobiography/> It has been claimed that the ''H. pylori'' theory was ridiculed by established scientists and doctors, who did not believe that any bacteria could live in the acidic environment of the stomach. Marshall was quoted as saying in 1998 that "everyone was against me, but I knew I was right."<ref>{{cite web | title =Barry Marshall Interview, H. Pylori and the Making of a Myth | publisher =[[Academy of Achievement]] | date =23 May 1998 | url =http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/printmember/mar1int-1 | access-date =28 January 2007 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20130624054540/http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/printmember/mar1int-1 | archive-date =24 June 2013 |url-status = dead}}</ref> On the other hand, it has also been argued that medical researchers showed a proper degree of [[scientific scepticism]] until the ''H. pylori'' hypothesis could be supported by evidence.<ref>{{cite journal| last =Atwood | first =Kimball C. |author-link=Kimball Atwood | title =Bacteria, Ulcers, and Ostracism? | journal =[[Skeptical Inquirer]] | date =November 2004 | url =http://www.csicop.org/si/show/bacteria_ulcers_and_ostracism_h._pylori_and_the_making_of_a_myth | access-date =17 July 2007 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20131017114043/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/bacteria_ulcers_and_ostracism_h._pylori_and_the_making_of_a_myth | archive-date =17 October 2013 |url-status = dead}}</ref>

In 1982 Marshall and Warren obtained funding for one year of research. The first 30 out of 100 samples showed no support for their hypothesis. However, it was discovered that the lab technicians had been throwing out the cultures after two days. This was standard practice for throat swabs where other organisms in the mouth rendered cultures unusable after two days. Due to other hospital work, the lab technicians did not have time to immediately throw out the 31st test on the second day, and so it stayed from Thursday through to the following Monday. In that sample, they discovered the presence of ''H. pylori''.  They later found out that ''H. pylori'' grow more slowly than two days, and the stomach cultures were not contaminated by other organisms.<ref name="auto">Seeing What Others Don't, chapter 4, by Gary Klein</ref>

In 1983 they submitted their findings thus far to the Gastroenterological Society of Australia, but the reviewers turned their paper down, rating it in the bottom 10% of those they received that year.<ref name="auto"/>

After failed attempts to infect piglets in 1984, Marshall, after having a baseline [[endoscopy]] done, drank a broth containing cultured ''H. pylori'', expecting to develop, perhaps years later, an ulcer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2010/mar/07-dr-drank-broth-gave-ulcer-solved-medical-mystery|title=The Doctor Who Drank Infectious Broth, Gave Himself an Ulcer, and Solved a Medical Mystery|website=Discover Magazine|access-date=23 January 2018|archive-date=24 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124070726/http://discovermagazine.com/2010/mar/07-dr-drank-broth-gave-ulcer-solved-medical-mystery|url-status=dead}}</ref> He was surprised when, only three days later, he developed vague nausea and [[halitosis]], due to the [[achlorhydria]].  There was no acid to kill bacteria in the stomach and their waste products manifested as [[bad breath]], noticed only by his mother. On days 5–8, he developed achlorhydric (no acid) vomiting. On day eight, he had a repeat endoscopy, which showed massive inflammation (gastritis), and a [[biopsy]] from which ''H. pylori'' was cultured, showing it had colonised his stomach. On the fourteenth day after ingestion, a third endoscopy was done, and Marshall began to take antibiotics.<ref>This story is related by Marshall in his Nobel acceptance lecture 8 December 2005, available for viewing on the Nobel website. {{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2005/marshall-bio.html|title=Barry J. Marshall – Biographical|work=[[Nobelprize.org]]|publisher=Nobel Media AB|access-date=1 August 2013}}</ref> Marshall did not develop antibodies to ''H. pylori'', suggesting that [[innate immunity]] can sometimes eradicate acute ''H. pylori'' infection. Marshall's illness and recovery, based on a culture of organisms extracted from a patient, fulfilled [[Koch's postulates]] for ''H. pylori'' and gastritis, but not for peptic ulcers. This experiment was published in 1985 in the ''[[Medical Journal of Australia]]''<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Marshall BJ, Armstrong JA, McGechie DB, Glancy RJ |title=Attempt to fulfil Koch's postulates for pyloric Campylobacter |journal=Medical Journal of Australia |volume=142 |issue=8 |pages=436–9 |year=1985 |pmid=3982345 |doi= 10.5694/j.1326-5377.1985.tb113443.x|s2cid=42243517 }}</ref> and is among the most cited articles from the journal.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Van Der Weyden |first1=Martin B |first2=Ruth M |last2=Armstrong |first3=Ann T |last3=Gregory | title =The 2005 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine |journal =Medical Journal of Australia | volume =183 | issue =11/12 | pages =612–4 |year =2005 | url =http://www.mja.com.au/public/issues/183_11_051205/van11000_fm.html#0_i1091639 }}</ref>

After his work at [[Fremantle Hospital]], Marshall did research at Royal Perth Hospital (1985–86) and at the [[University of Virginia]], USA (1986–present), before returning to Australia while remaining on the faculty of the University of Virginia.<ref name="virginia.edu" /> He held a Burnet Fellowship at the University of Western Australia (UWA) from 1998–2003.<ref>{{cite web | title =Professor Barry Marshall | publisher =University of Western Australia | date =28 July 2006 | url =http://www.postgraduate.uwa.edu.au/home/prospective/heroes/marshall | access-date =28 January 2007  | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070217034612/http://www.postgraduate.uwa.edu.au/home/prospective/heroes/marshall| archive-date= 17 February 2007 |url-status = live}}</ref> Marshall continues research related to ''H. pylori'' and runs the ''H. pylori'' Research Laboratory at UWA.<ref>{{cite web | first=Barry | last=Marshall | title =Helicobacter pylori Research Laboratory | publisher =[[University of Western Australia]] | date =26 August 2002 | url =http://www.hpylori.com.au | access-date =28 January 2007  | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070128012719/http://www.hpylori.com.au/| archive-date= 28 January 2007 |url-status = live}} Marshall's home page and various links can also be found there.</ref>

In 2007, Marshall was appointed Co-Director of The Marshall Centre for Infectious Diseases Research and Training, founded in his honour. In addition to ''Helicobacter pylori'' research, the Centre conducted varied research into infectious disease identification and surveillance, diagnostics and drug design, and transformative discovery. His research group expanded to embrace new technologies, including [[Next-Generation Sequencing]] and [[genomic analysis]].  Marshall also accepted a part-time appointment at the [[Pennsylvania State University]] that same year.<ref>{{cite web | title =Nobel laureate Marshall joins Penn State faculty | url =http://live.psu.edu/story/25683 | publisher =Penn State Live | date =6 September 2007 | access-date =6 September 2007 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20110825202825/http://live.psu.edu/story/25683 | archive-date =25 August 2011 |url-status = dead}}</ref>  In August 2020, Marshall, along with Simon J.

<blockquote>Barry Marshall, together with Robin Warren, discovered spiral bacteria in the stomachs of almost all patients with active chronic gastritis, or duodenal or gastric ulcers, and proposed that the bacteria were an important factor in the aetiology of these diseases. In 1985, Marshall showed by self-administration that this bacterium, now called Helicobacter pylori, causes acute gastritis and suggested that chronic colonisation directly leads to peptic ulceration. These results were a major challenge to the prevailing view that gastric disorders had a physiological basis, rather than being infectious diseases. Marshall showed that antibiotic and bismuth salt regimens that killed H. pylori resulted in the cure of duodenal ulcers. The view that gastric disorders are infectious diseases is now firmly established and there is increasing evidence for a role of H. pylori infection in gastric cancers. The work of Marshall has produced one of the most radical and important changes in medical perception in the last 50 years. Barry Marshall was awarded the Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Science in 1995 and the Buchanan Medal in 1998.</blockquote>
