'''Hermann Staudinger''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhɛʁman ˈʃtaʊ̯dɪŋɐ|-|De-Hermann Staudinger.ogg}}; 23 March 1881 – 8 September 1965) was a German [[organic chemist]] who demonstrated the existence of [[macromolecule]]s, which he characterized as [[polymer]]s. For this work he received the 1953 [[Nobel Prize]] in Chemistry.

He is also known for his discovery of [[ketene]]s and of the [[Staudinger reaction]]. Staudinger, together with [[Leopold Ružička]], also elucidated the molecular structures of [[pyrethrin I]] and II in the 1920s, enabling the development of [[pyrethroid]] [[insecticides]] in the 1960s and 1970s.

==Early work==
Staudinger was born in 1881 in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]. Staudinger, who initially wanted to become a botanist, studied chemistry at the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Halle]], at the [[Technische Universität Darmstadt|TH Darmstadt]] and at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|LMU Munich]]. He received his "Verbandsexamen" (comparable to Master's degree) from [[Technische Universität Darmstadt|TH Darmstadt]]. After receiving his Ph.D. from the [[University of Halle]] in 1903, Staudinger qualified as an academic lecturer at the [[University of Strasbourg]] in 1907.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1953/staudinger-bio.html |title=Hermann Staudinger - Biographical |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=1953 |website=Nobelprize.org |access-date=13 March 2018 }}</ref> [[File:Ketenes.png|thumb|100px|'''Figure 1.'''

In 1907, Staudinger began an assistant professorship at the [[University of Karlsruhe|Technical University of Karlsruhe]].  Here, he successfully isolated a number of useful organic compounds (including a synthetic coffee flavoring) as more completely reviewed by Rolf Mülhaupt.<ref name="mul">{{cite journal

== The Staudinger reaction ==
In 1912, Staudinger took on a new position at the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] in [[Zurich, Switzerland]]. One of his earliest discoveries came in 1919, when he and colleague Meyer reported that [[organic azide]]s react with [[triphenylphosphine]] to form  phosphinimines   ('''Figure   2''').<ref name="ref2">{{cite journal

[[Image:Nylon6 and Nylon 66.png|thumb|left|320px|[[Nylon 6]] and [[Nylon 6-6]]]]

==Polymer chemistry==
While at Karlsruhe and later, Zurich, Staudinger began research in the chemistry of [[rubber]], for which very high [[molecular mass|molecular weights]] had been measured by the physical methods of [[François-Marie Raoult|Raoult]] and [[Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff|van 't Hoff]]. Contrary to prevailing ideas (see below), Staudinger proposed in a landmark paper published in 1920 that [[rubber]] and other [[polymer]]s such as [[starch]], [[cellulose]] and [[proteins]] are long chains of short repeating molecular units linked by [[covalent bonds]].<ref name="ref4">{{cite journal | author = Staudinger, H. | journal = [[Ber. Dtsch. Chem. Ges.]] | year = 1920 | volume = 53 | pages = 1073–1085 | doi = 10.1002/cber.19200530627 | title = Über Polymerisation | issue = 6| url = https://zenodo.org/record/1426679 }}</ref> In other words, polymers are like chains of paper clips, made up of small constituent parts linked from end to end ('''Figure 3'''). 
[[Image:clipspla.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 3.''' A chain of paper clips ''(above)'' is a good model for a polymer such as [[polylactic acid]] ''(below)''. The polymer chain is composed of small pieces linked together in a head-to-tail fashion.]]

At the time, leading organic chemists such as [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]] and [[Heinrich Wieland]]<ref name="mul" /><ref name="ref5">{{cite journal |author1=Feldman, S. D. |author2=Tauber, A. I. | journal = [[Bulletin of the History of Medicine]] | year = 1997 | volume = 17 | pages = 623–650 | doi = 10.1353/bhm.1997.0178 | title = Sickle Cell Anemia: Reexamining the First &quot;Molecular Disease&quot; | issue=4|pmid=9431738 |s2cid=46017893 }}</ref> believed that the measured high molecular weights were only apparent values caused by the aggregation of small molecules into [[colloids]]. At first, the majority of Staudinger’s colleagues refused to accept the possibility that small molecules could link together covalently to form high-molecular weight compounds. As Mülhaupt aptly notes, this is due in part to the fact that molecular structure and bonding theory were not fully understood in the early 20th century.<ref name="mul" />

In 1926, he was appointed lecturer of chemistry at the [[University of Freiburg]] at Freiburg im Breisgau (Germany), where he spent the rest of his career.<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1953/staudinger-bio.html Biography on Nobel prize website]</ref> In 1927, he married the Latvian botanist, [[Magda Staudinger|Magda Voita]] (also shown as; {{lang-de|Magda Woit}}), who was a collaborator with him until his death and whose contributions he acknowledged in his Nobel Prize acceptance.{{sfn|Ogilvie|Harvey|2000|p=1223}} Further evidence to support his polymer hypothesis emerged in the 1930s. High molecular weights of polymers were confirmed by [[osmotic pressure|membrane osmometry]], and also by Staudinger’s measurements of [[viscosity]] in solution. The [[X-ray diffraction]] studies of polymers by [[Herman Mark]] provided direct evidence for long chains of repeating molecular units. And the synthetic work led by [[Wallace Carothers|Carothers]] demonstrated that polymers such as [[nylon]] and [[polyester]] could be prepared by well-understood organic reactions. His theory opened up the subject to further development, and helped place polymer science on a sound basis.

==Legacy==
Staudinger's groundbreaking elucidation of the nature of the high-molecular weight compounds he termed ''Makromoleküle'' paved the way for the birth of the field of polymer chemistry.<ref name="ref6">{{cite journal | author = Staudinger, H. | journal = [[Trans. Faraday Soc.]] | year = 1933 | volume = 29 | pages = 18–32 | doi = 10.1039/tf9332900018 | title = Viscosity investigations for the examination of the constitution of natural products of high molecular weight and of rubber and cellulose | issue = 140}}</ref> Staudinger himself saw the potential for this science long before it was fully realized. "It is not improbable," Staudinger commented in 1936, "that sooner or later a way will be discovered to prepare artificial fibers from synthetic high-molecular products, because the strength and elasticity of natural fibers depend exclusively on their macro-molecular structure – i.e., on their long thread-shaped molecules."<ref name="ref7">{{cite journal | author = Staudinger, H. | journal = [[Trans.

</ref> and in 1953 received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for "his discoveries in the field of macromolecular chemistry."<ref name="ref9">[http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/1953/index.html The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1953] (accessed Mar 2006).</ref>  In 1999, the [[American Chemical Society]] and [[Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker]] designated Staudinger's work as an [[National Historic Chemical Landmarks|International Historic Chemical Landmark]].<ref name="Landmark">{{cite web |url = https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/staudingerpolymerscience.html |title = Hermann Staudinger and the Foundation of Polymer Science |publisher = American Chemical Society |work = International Historic Chemical Landmarks |access-date = 21 August 2018 }}</ref> His pioneering research has afforded the world myriad plastics, textiles, and other polymeric materials which make consumer products more affordable, attractive and enjoyable, while helping engineers develop lighter and more durable structures.
