'''Richard Frederick Heck''' (August 15, 1931 – October 10, 2015) was an American chemist noted for the discovery and development of the  [[Heck reaction]], which uses [[palladium]] to [[catalyst|catalyze]] [[organic chemical]] [[chemical reaction|reaction]]s that couple [[aryl halide]]s with [[alkene]]s. The analgesic [[naproxen]] is an example of a compound that is prepared industrially using the Heck reaction.

For his work in [[palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions]] and [[organic synthesis]], Heck was awarded the 2010 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]], shared with the Japanese chemists [[Ei-ichi Negishi]] and [[Akira Suzuki (chemist)|Akira Suzuki]].<ref>{{Cite journal | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2010/press.html | title = Press release 6 October 2010 | publisher = Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences | access-date = October 6, 2010}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Heck was born in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] in 1931.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2010/10/nobel_prize_win.html |title=Nobel Prize winner is Springfield native |first=Martin |last=Finucane |newspaper=[[Boston Globe]] |date=October 6, 2010 }}</ref> He earned his Ph.D. in physical organic chemistry in 1954 at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA), working under the supervision of Dr. [[Saul Winstein]]. After two periods of postdoctoral research at the [[ETH Zurich|ETH]] in [[Zurich, Switzerland]], and then back at UCLA, Heck took a position with the [[Hercules Corporation]] in [[Wilmington, Delaware]] in 1957. After productive research work at Hercules, he was hired by the [[University of Delaware]]'s Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry in 1971. Heck was a [[professor]] of [[chemistry]] at the University of Delaware. In 2012, he was appointed by [[De La Salle University]] in [[Manila]] as [[adjunct professor]] in its chemistry department.

The development of the [[Heck reaction]] began with Heck's investigations of the coupling of [[Organomercury|arylmercury]] compounds with olefins using [[palladium]] as a catalyst during the late 1960s.<ref>{{cite journal

The importance of this reaction grew slowly in the organic synthesis community.

Today, the [[Heck reaction]] stands as one of the widely used methods for the creation of [[carbon-carbon bond]]s in the synthesis of [[Organic compound|organic chemicals]].

===Palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions===
{{See also|Palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions}}
Heck's work set the stage for a variety of other [[palladium]]-catalyzed coupling reactions, including those of aryl halides with derivatives of [[boronic acid]] ([[Suzuki reaction|Suzuki–Miyaura coupling]]), [[organotin]] reagents ([[Stille reaction|Stille coupling]]), [[organomagnesium]] compounds ([[Kumada coupling|Kumada-Corriu coupling]]), [[silane]]s ([[Hiyama coupling]]), and [[organozinc]]s ([[Negishi coupling]]), as well as with amines ([[Buchwald–Hartwig amination]]) and [[alcohols]].<ref name="complex"/> These palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions are now widely practiced in organic synthesis, including in the [[chemical engineering]] production of certain [[organic compound]]s in factories.<ref name="PCCR"/>

Of the several reactions developed by Heck, the greatest societal impact has been from the palladium-catalyzed coupling of an alkyne with an aryl [[halide]]. This is the reaction that was used to couple fluorescent dyes to DNA bases, allowing the automation of [[DNA sequencing]] and the examination of the [[human genome]]. In Sonogashira's original report of what is now known as the [[Sonogashira coupling]], his group modified an alkyne coupling procedure previously reported by Heck, by adding a copper(I) salt.<ref name="PCCR">{{cite journal

==Later life and death==
Heck retired from the University of Delaware in 1989, where he became the Willis F. Harrington Professor Emeritus in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry. Its  annual lectureship was named in his honor in 2004. In 2005, he was awarded the Wallace H. Carothers Award, which recognizes creative applications of chemistry that have had substantial commercial impact. He was awarded the 2006 Herbert C. Brown Award for Creative Research in Synthetic Methods.<ref name=acs>{{cite journal |periodical=[[Chemical & Engineering News|C&EN]] |volume=84 |issue=6 |pages=34–38 |date=February 6, 2006 |title=2006 ACS National Award Winners |url=http://pubs.acs.org/email/cen/html/020906105850.html#5 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5z192K7jM?url=http://pubs.acs.org/email/cen/html/020906105850.html |archive-date=May 28, 2011 |url-status=dead }}.</ref> On October 6, 2010, the Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences awarded Heck the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.
