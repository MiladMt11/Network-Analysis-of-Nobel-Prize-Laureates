==Education and early career==
Edwards was born in [[Batley]], Yorkshire, and attended [[Manchester Academy (Moss Side)|Manchester Central High School]]<ref name="whoswho"/> on Whitworth Street in central Manchester, after which he served in the [[British Army]], and then completed his undergraduate studies in biology, graduating with an Ordinary degree at [[Bangor University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sla-divisions.typepad.com/dbio/2010/10/robert-g-edwards-2010-nobel-prize-winner-in-physiology-or-medicine.html |title=SLA Biomedical & Life Sciences Division Blog: Robert G.

==Career and research==
After a year as a [[postdoctoral research]] fellow at the [[California Institute of Technology]] he joined the scientific staff of the [[National Institute for Medical Research]] at Mill Hill. After a further year at the [[University of Glasgow]], in 1963 he moved to the [[University of Cambridge]] as Ford Foundation Research Fellow at the Department of Physiology, and a member of [[Churchill College, Cambridge]]. He was appointed [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in physiology in 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/medicine-obituaries/9984988/Professor-Sir-Robert-Edwards.html |title=Professor Sir Robert Edwards |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=10 April 2013 |access-date=14 April 2013}}</ref>

===Human fertilisation===
{{further|in vitro fertilisation}}
Circa 1960 Edwards started to study human [[fertilisation]], and he continued his work at Cambridge, laying the groundwork for his later success. In 1968 he was able to achieve fertilisation of a human egg in the laboratory and started to collaborate with [[Patrick Steptoe]], a [[Gynaecology|gynaecological]] surgeon from [[Oldham]]. Edwards developed human culture media to allow the fertilisation and early [[embryo]] culture, while Steptoe used [[laparoscopy]] to recover [[ovocyte]]s from patients with tubal [[infertility]]. Their attempts met significant hostility and opposition,<ref name="pz_opposition">{{cite web | author=Myers, P.

The birth of [[Louise Brown]], the world's first 'test-tube baby', at {{Nowrap|11:47&nbsp;pm}} on {{Nowrap|25 July}} 1978 at the [[Oldham General Hospital]] made medical history: in vitro fertilisation meant a new way to help infertile couples who formerly had no possibility of having a baby.  Nurse [[Jean Purdy]] was the first to see Brown's embryo dividing.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Weule |first1=Genelle |title=The first IVF baby was born 40 years ago today |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2018-07-25/first-ivf-baby-louise-joy-brown-turns-40/10017032 |access-date=25 July 2018 |work=ABC News |date=25 July 2018 |language=en-AU}}</ref>

Refinements in technology have increased pregnancy rates and it is estimated that in 2010 about {{Nowrap|4 million}} children have been born by IVF,<ref name="nobelpr"/> with approximately 170,000 coming from donated [[oocyte]] and embryos.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090220015146/http://www.obgmanagement.com/srm/pdf/first_live_birth_donation.pdf First live birth donation]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.obgmanagement.com/srm.asp?id=5030 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008194941/http://www.obgmanagement.com/srm.asp?id=5030 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2007-10-08 |title=Home – OBG Management |publisher=Obgmanagement.com |access-date=14 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theafa.org/library/article/talking_with_children_about_ovum_donation_2009 |title=Library |publisher=TheAFA.org |access-date=14 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922111227/http://www.theafa.org/library/article/talking_with_children_about_ovum_donation_2009/ |archive-date=22 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Their breakthrough laid the groundwork for further innovations such as intracytoplasmatic sperm injection [[Intracytoplasmic sperm injection|ICSI]], embryo biopsy ([[Preimplantation genetic diagnosis|PGD]]), and [[stem cell]] research.

Edwards and Steptoe founded the [[Bourn Hall Clinic]] as a place to advance their work and train new specialists. Steptoe died in 1988. Edwards continued on in his career as a scientist and an editor of medical journals.

===Honours and awards===
Edwards received numerous honours and awards including:

* Edwards featured in the [[BBC Radio 4]] series ''[[The New Elizabethans]]'' to mark the [[diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II]] in 2012.
