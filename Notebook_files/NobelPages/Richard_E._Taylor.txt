==Early life==
Taylor was born in [[Medicine Hat, Alberta]]. He studied for his BSc (1950) and MSc (1952) degrees at the [[University of Alberta]] in Edmonton, Canada. Newly married, he applied to work for a PhD degree at [[Stanford University]], where he joined the High Energy Physics Laboratory.<ref name=nobel>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1990/taylor-speech.html Taylors Nobel banquet speech]</ref>

His PhD thesis was on an experiment using polarised [[gamma ray]]s to study [[pion]] production.<ref name=taylorhd>{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Richard Edward|last=Taylor |title=Positive pion production by polarized bremsstrahlung |publisher=Stanford University |year=1962 |oclc=38657023}}</ref>

==Research and career==
After 3 years at the [[École Normale Supérieure]] in Paris and a year at the [[Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory]] in California, Taylor returned to Stanford.<ref name=osti>[http://www.osti.gov/accomplishments/friedman_taylor_kendall.html Biography and Bibliographic Resources], from the [[Office of Scientific and Technical Information]], [[United States Department of Energy]]</ref> Construction of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (now the [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory]]) was beginning.<ref name="WPO"/> In collaboration with researchers from the [[California Institute of Technology]] and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], Taylor worked on the design and construction of the equipment, and was involved in many of the experiments.<ref name="WPO"/>

In 1971, Taylor was awarded a [[Guggenheim fellowship]] that allowed him to spend a sabbatical year at [[CERN]].<ref name="nobel-bio"/>

The experiments run at SLAC in the late 1960s and early 1970s involved scattering high-energy beams of [[electron]]s from [[proton]]s and [[deuteron]]s and heavier [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]].<ref name=scopus>{{Scopus|id=7405760718}}</ref><ref name="PrescottAtwood1978">{{cite journal|last1=Prescott|first1=C.Y.|last2=Atwood|first2=W.B.|last3=Cottrell|first3=R.L.A.|last4=DeStaebler|first4=H.|last5=Garwin|first5=Edward L.|last6=Gonidec|first6=A.|last7=Miller|first7=R.H.|last8=Rochester|first8=L.S.|last9=Sato|first9=T.|last10=Sherden|first10=D.J.|last11=Sinclair|first11=C.K.|last12=Stein|first12=S.|last13=Taylor|first13=R.E.|last14=Clendenin|first14=J.E.|last15=Hughes|first15=V.W.|last16=Sasao|first16=N.|last17=Schüler|first17=K.P.|last18=Borghini|first18=M.G.|last19=Lübelsmeyer|first19=K.|last20=Jentschke|first20=W.|title=Parity non-conservation in inelastic electron scattering|journal=Physics Letters B|volume=77|issue=3|year=1978|pages=347–352|issn=0370-2693|doi=10.1016/0370-2693(78)90722-0|bibcode = 1978PhLB...77..347P |osti=1446939}}</ref><ref name="BloomCoward1969">{{cite journal|last1=Bloom|first1=E.

Taylor, Friedman and Kendall were jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in 1990 for this work.<ref name="nobel-press">[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1990/press.html Nobel prize press release]</ref>

Taylor died at his home in [[Stanford, California]] near the campus of Stanford University on 22 February 2018 at the age of 88.<ref name="WPO">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/richard-taylor-nobel-winning-physicist-who-helped-discover-quarks-dies-at-88/2018/02/24/3a7c8bda-18ea-11e8-8b08-027a6ccb38eb_story.html|title=Richard E.

==In popular culture==
In May 2019, the announcement of the 1990 Nobel Prize for physics was featured on the season 2 finale of the TV series [[Young Sheldon]]. "A Swedish Science Thing and the Equation for Toast" featured Sheldon Cooper as a child, listening to a short wave radio as the Nobel Prize was announced in Sweden.
