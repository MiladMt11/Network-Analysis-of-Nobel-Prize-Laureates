'''Manfred Eigen''' ({{IPA-de|ˈmanˌfʁeːt ˈaɪ̯ɡn̩|-|De-Manfred Eigen.ogg}}; 9 May 1927 – 6 February 2019) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Biophysical chemistry|biophysical chemist]] who won the 1967 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]<ref name=nobel>{{Citation|pmid=4860395|last1=Weisskopf|first1=V.

Eigen's research helped solve major problems in physical chemistry and aided in the understanding of chemical processes that occur in living organisms.

In later years, he explored the biochemical roots of life and evolution. He worked to install a multidisciplinary program at the [[Max Planck Institute]] to study the underpinnings of life at the molecular level. His work was hailed for creating a new scientific and technological discipline: evolutionary [[biotechnology]].<ref name=BG/>

==Education and early life==
Eigen was born on 9 May 1927 in [[Bochum]],<ref>{{Citation|pmid=3300802|publication-date=9 May 1987|year=1987|title=Manfred Eigen Festschrift: special issue dedicated to Professor Manfred Eigen on the occasion of his 60th birthday|volume=26|issue=2–3|periodical=Biophys.

Chem.|pages=71–3|doi = 10.1016/S0301-4622(97)00075-6}}</ref> the son of Hedwig (Feld) and Ernst Eigen, a chamber musician.<ref name="Nobel_biographical"/> As a child he developed a deep passion for music, and studied piano.<ref name=BG/>

[[World War II]] interrupted his formal education. At age fifteen he was drafted into service in a German antiaircraft unit. He was captured by the Soviets toward the end of the war. He managed to escape (he said later that escape was relatively easy),<ref name=BG/> and walked hundreds of miles across defeated Germany, arriving in Göttingen in 1945. He lacked the necessary documentation for acceptance to university,<ref>{{Cite book|title=Creativity: The psychology of discovery and invention|last=Czikszentmihalyi|first=Mihaly|publisher=Harper Perennial|year=2013|pages=54}}</ref> but was admitted after he demonstrated his knowledge in an exam. He entered the university's first postwar class.

Eigen desired to study Physics, but since returning soldiers who were previously enrolled received priority, he enrolled in Geophysics. He earned an undergraduate degree and entered graduate study in natural sciences. One of his advisors was [[Werner Heisenberg]], the noted proponent of the [[uncertainty principle]].<ref name=BG/> He received his doctorate in 1951.

==Career and research==
Eigen received his Ph.D. at the [[University of Göttingen]] in 1951 under supervision of [[Arnold Eucken]].<ref name=mathgene/> In 1964 he presented the results of his research at a meeting of the [[Faraday Society]] in London. His findings demonstrated for the first time that it was possible to determine the rates of chemical reactions that occurred during time intervals as brief as a nanosecond.

Beginning in 1953 Eigen worked at the [[Max Planck Institute]] for Physical Chemistry in [[Göttingen]], becoming its director in 1964 and joining it with the Max Planck Institute for Spectroscopy to become the [[Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry]]. He was an honorary professor of the [[Braunschweig University of Technology]]. From 1982 to 1993, Eigen was president of the [[German National Merit Foundation]]. Eigen was a member of the Board of Sponsors of ''The [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]''.<ref>{{Citation|pmid=3300804|publication-date=9 May 1987|date=1987|title=List of publications by Manfred Eigen|volume=26|issue=2–3|periodical=Biophys.

In 1967, Eigen was awarded, along with [[Ronald George Wreyford Norrish]]<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dainton|first1=F.|last2=Thrush|first2=B. A.|title=Ronald George Wreyford Norrish. 9 November 1897-7 June 1978|journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society|volume=27|year=1981|pages=379–424|issn=0080-4606|doi=10.1098/rsbm.1981.0016|s2cid=72584163}}</ref> and [[George Porter]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Fleming|first1=G.

They were cited for their studies of extremely fast [[chemical reaction]]s induced in response to very short [[Pulse (physics)|pulse]]s of [[energy]].

In addition, Eigen's name is linked with the theory of [[quasispecies]], the [[error threshold]], [[error catastrophe]], [[Eigen's paradox]], and the chemical [[hypercycle (chemistry)|hypercycle]], the cyclic linkage of reaction cycles as an explanation for the [[self-organization]] of [[origin of life|prebiotic systems]], which he described with [[Peter Schuster]] in 1977.<ref>Eigen & Schuster (1977) [https://unterlagen.site/document/eigen1977naturwissenschaften64.html The Hypercycle.
