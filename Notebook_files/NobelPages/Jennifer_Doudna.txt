==Early life and education==
Jennifer Doudna was born February 19, 1964, in Washington, D.C., as the daughter of Dorothy Jane (Williams) and Martin Kirk Doudna.<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=voRmAAAAMAAJ&q=%22Arthur+Bundy+and+Ruth+Edson+(+Dewey+)+D+.;+m+.+Dorothy+Jane+Williams+,+Sept.+15.+1962+;+children+:+Jennifer+Anne%22|title = Who's who in the West|year = 1999|isbn = 9780837909240}}</ref> Her father received his Ph.D. in English literature from the [[University of Michigan]], and her mother, a stay-at-home parent, held a master's degree in education.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":0" /> When Doudna was seven years old, the family moved to Hawaii so her father could accept a teaching position in American literature at the [[University of Hawaii at Hilo]].<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":0" /> Doudna's mother earned a second master's degree in Asian history from the university and taught history at a local community college.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":0" /> Growing up in [[Hilo, Hawaii]], Doudna was fascinated by the environmental beauty of the island and its exotic [[flora and fauna]]. Nature built her sense of curiosity and her desire to understand the underlying biological mechanisms of life.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":0" /> This was coupled with the atmosphere of intellectual pursuit that her parents encouraged at home. Her father enjoyed reading about science and filled the home with many books on [[popular science]].<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":0" /> When Doudna was in the sixth grade, he gave her a copy of [[James Watson]]'s 1968 book on the discovery of the structure of DNA, ''[[The Double Helix]],'' which was a major inspiration.<ref name="Doudna12" /> Doudna also developed her interest in science and mathematics in school.<ref name=":4" /><ref name="Doudna12">{{cite web |url=http://www.asbmb.org/asbmbtoday/201408/Features/Doudna/ |title=On the same wavelength |last1=Mukhopadyay |first1=Rajendrani |publisher=American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology |access-date=October 24, 2017 }}</ref> While she attended [[Hilo High School]], Doudna's interest in science was nurtured by her 10th-grade chemistry teacher, Ms. Jeanette Wong, whom she has routinely cited as a significant influence in sparking her nascent scientific curiosity.<ref name="Doudna12" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.civilbeat.org/2020/10/lee-cataluna-remembering-the-hilo-teacher-who-inspired-a-nobel-prize-winner/ |title= Remembering The Hilo Teacher Who Inspired A Nobel Prize Winner |last1=Cataluna |first1=Lee |publisher=Honolulu Civil Beat |access-date=October 22, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://sbgrid.org/software/tale/big_questions_big_answers |title= Big Questions, Big Answers |publisher=SBGrid Consortium |access-date=October 22, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://kavliprize.org/events-and-features/2018-kavli-prize-nanoscience-conversation-jennifer-doudna-emmanuelle-charpentier |title= 2018 Kavli Prize in Nanoscience: A Conversation with Jennifer Doudna, Emmanuelle Charpentier and Virginijus Šikšnys |publisher=The Kavli Prize |access-date=October 22, 2020}}</ref> A visiting lecturer on cancer cells further encouraged her pursuit of science as a career choice.<ref name="Doudna12" /> She spent a summer working in the [[University of Hawaii at Hilo]] lab of noted [[mycology|mycologist]] Don Hemmes and graduated from [[Hilo High School]] in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|title=Genome editing pioneer and Hilo High graduate Jennifer Doudna speaks at UH Hilo about her discovery: CRISPR technology|url=https://hilo.hawaii.edu/chancellor/stories/2018/09/19/genome-editing-pioneer-and-hilo-high-graduate-jennifer-doudna-speaks-at-uh-hilo-about-her-discovery-crispr-technology/|access-date=October 7, 2020|publisher=UH Hilo Stories}}</ref>

Doudna was an undergraduate student at [[Pomona College]] in [[Claremont, California]], where she studied [[biochemistry]].<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":0" /> During her freshman year, while taking a course in general chemistry, she questioned her own ability to pursue a career in science, and considered switching her major to French as a sophomore.<ref name="pnasbio" /><ref name=":4" /> However, her French teacher suggested she stick with science.<ref name=":4" /><ref name="pnasbio" /> Chemistry professors [[Fred Grieman]] and [[Corwin Hansch]] at Pomona had a major impact on her.<ref name="pnasbio" /> She started her first scientific research in the lab of professor Sharon Panasenko.<ref name="pnasbio" /> She earned her Bachelor of Arts degree in Biochemistry in 1985.<ref name="pnasbio" /><ref name="TSL Nobel">{{cite news |last1=Engineer |first1=Anushe |title=Pomona College alumna wins Nobel Prize in Chemistry |url=https://tsl.news/pomona-college-alum-awarded-nobel/ |access-date=October 8, 2020 |work=[[The Student Life]] |date=October 7, 2020}}</ref> She chose [[Harvard Medical School]] for her doctoral study and earned a PhD in Biological Chemistry and Molecular Pharmacology in 1989.<ref name="cv" /><ref name="thesis-doudna-1989">{{cite thesis |title=Towards the Design of an RNA Replicase |date=1989 |institution=Harvard University |degree=Ph.D. |last=Doudna |first=Jennifer Anne |id={{ProQuest|303754572}} |oclc=23230360}}</ref> Her Ph.D. dissertation was on a system that increased the efficiency of a self-replicating catalytic [[RNA]]<ref name="BP" /> and was supervised by [[Jack W. Szostak]].<ref name="BP" />

== Career and research ==
After her PhD, she held [[research fellow]]ships in molecular biology at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] and in genetics at Harvard Medical School.<ref name="cv" /> From 1991 to 1994, she was Lucille P. Markey [[Postdoctoral researcher|Postdoctoral Scholar]] in Biomedical Science at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]], where she worked with [[Thomas Cech]].<ref name="cv" />

=== Research on ribozyme structure and function ===
Early in her scientific career, Doudna worked to uncover the structure and biological function of [[RNA]] enzymes or [[ribozyme]]s.<ref name="pnasbio" /> While in the Szostak lab, Doudna re-engineered the self-splicing ''Tetrahymena'' [[Group I catalytic intron]] into a true catalytic ribozyme that copied RNA templates.<ref name="pnasbio" /> Her focus was on engineering ribozymes and understanding their underlying mechanisms; however, she came to realize that not being able to see the molecular mechanisms of ribozymes was a major problem. Doudna went to the lab of Thomas Cech at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]] to crystallize and determine the three-dimensional structure of a ribozyme for the first time, so ribozyme structure could be compared with that of [[Enzyme]]s, the [[Catalysis|catalytic]] [[Protein]]s.<ref name="pnasbio" /> She started this project at the Cech lab in 1991 and finished it at [[Yale University]] in 1996.<ref name="BP" /> Doudna joined Yale's Department of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry as an assistant professor in 1994.<ref name="cv" /> [[File:Jennifer Doudna by Chris Michel 03.jpg|thumb|Dr Portrait of Jennifer Doudna by Christopher Michel for the National Academies]]

=== X-ray diffraction-based structure of active site of a ribozyme at Yale ===
[[File:065-Self-Splicing-RNA-1u6b.tiff|thumb|Shape of a self-splicing intron with two exons (shown in red and blue). DS Goodsell, 2005, PDB]]
At Yale, Doudna's group was able to crystallize and solve the three-dimensional structure of the catalytic core of the ''[[Tetrahymena]]'' [[Group I catalytic intron|Group I ribozyme]].<ref name="pnasbio" /> They showed that a core of five magnesium ions clustered in one region of the P4-P6 domain of the ribozyme, forming a hydrophobic core around which the rest of the structure could fold.<ref name="pnasbio" /> This is analogous, but chemically distinct from, the way proteins typically have a core of hydrophobic amino acids.<ref name="pnasbio" /> Her group has crystallized other ribozymes,<ref name="BP" /> including the [[HDV ribozyme|Hepatitis Delta Virus ribozyme]].<ref name="pnasbio" /> This initial work to solve large RNA structures led to further structural studies on an internal ribosome entry site([[Internal ribosome entry site|IRES]]) and protein-RNA complexes such as the [[Signal recognition particle|Signal Recognition Particle]].<ref name="pnasbio" />

Doudna was promoted to the position of [[Henry Ford II]] Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry at Yale in 2000. In 2000–2001, she was Robert Burns Woodward Visiting Professor of Chemistry at [[Harvard University]].<ref name="cv" />

=== Move to Berkeley ===

In 2002, she joined her husband, Jamie Cate, at [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]], accepting a position as professor of biochemistry and molecular biology.<ref name="BP" /> Doudna also gained access to the [[Advanced Light Source|synchrotron]] at [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] for her experiments with high powered x-ray diffraction.<ref name="BP" />

In 2009, she took a leave of absence from Berkeley to work at [[Genentech]] to lead discovery research.<ref name=":02">{{cite web|url=https://cen.acs.org/biological-chemistry/gene-editing/A-day-with-Jennifer-Doudna-Trying-to-keep-up-with-one-of-the-world-most-sought-after-scientists/98/i9|title=A DAY WITH JENNIFER DOUDNA: TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST SOUGHT-AFTER SCIENTISTS |date=March 8, 2020}}</ref> She left [[Genentech]] after two months and returned to Berkeley with the help of colleague [[Michael Marletta]],{{sfn|Isaacson|2021|p=101}} cancelling all of her obligations to study [[CRISPR]].<ref name=":02"/>

As of 2020, Doudna was located at the University of California, Berkeley, where she directs the Innovative Genomics Institute, a collaboration between Berkeley and the [[University of California, San Francisco|UCSF]]; holds the [[Li Ka-shing|Li Ka Shing]] Chancellor's Professorship in Biomedicine and Health; and is the chair of the Chancellor's Advisor Committee on Biology.<ref name="cv" /> Her lab now focuses on obtaining a mechanistic understanding of biological processes involving RNA.<ref name="BP" /> This work is divided into three major areas: the [[CRISPR]] system, [[RNA interference]], and translational control via [[MicroRNAs]].<ref name="BP" />

=== CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing discovery ===
Doudna was introduced to [[CRISPR]] by [[Jillian Banfield]] in 2006 who had found Doudna by way of a Google search, having typed "RNAi and UC Berkeley" into her browser, and Doudna's name came up at the top of the list.<ref>[https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/10/07/jill-banfield-how-a-curious-google-search-led-me-to-jennifer-doudna/ Jill Banfield: How a curious Google search led me to Jennifer Doudna], Jill Banfield (Berkeley News, published October 7, 2020)</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbNI_V0P574&t=41s Jennifer Doudna's First Reactions to 2020 Nobel Prize Win] (published October 7, 2020, to the UC Berkeley channel on YouTube)</ref> In 2012, Doudna and her colleagues made a new discovery that reduces the time and work needed to edit genomic DNA.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1225829 |pmid=22745249 |pmc=6286148 |title=A Programmable Dual-RNA-Guided DNA Endonuclease in Adaptive Bacterial Immunity |journal=Science |volume=337 |issue=6096 |pages=816–821 |year=2012 |last1=Jinek |first1=M. |last2=Chylinski |first2=K. |last3=Fonfara |first3=I. |last4=Hauer |first4=M. |last5=Doudna |first5=J.

The CRISPR system created a new straightforward way to edit DNA and there was a rush to patent the technique.<ref name=":4" /> Doudna and UC Berkeley collaborators applied for a patent and so did a group at the [[Broad Institute]] affiliated with the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and Harvard.<ref name=":2" /> [[Feng Zhang]] at the Broad Institute had shown that CRISPR-Cas9 could edit genes in cultured human cells a few months after Doudna and Charpentier published their method.<ref name=":1" /> Before the UC Berkeley patent application was decided, a patent was granted to the Broad investigators and UC Berkeley filed a lawsuit against the decision.<ref name=":2" /> In 2017, the court decided in favor of the Broad Institute, who claimed that they had initiated the research earliest and had first applied it to human cell engineering thus supporting editing in human cells with evidence but that the UC Berkeley group had only suggested this application.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com%2Fscience%2Fsciencenow%2Fla-sci-sn-crispr-patent-decision-20170215-story.html|title=UC Berkeley suffers big loss in CRISPR patent fight: What's next for the gene-editing technology?|last=Netburn|first=Deborah|date=February 15, 2017|website=Los Angeles Times|access-date=September 2, 2018}}</ref> UC Berkeley appealed on grounds that they had clearly discussed and spelled out how to do the application the Broad had pursued.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/bloomberg/this-court-battle-will-decide-who-will-make-a-fortune-from-gene-editing-tech-94f47fd39ce8|title=This court battle will decide who will make a fortune from gene-editing technique|last=Decker |last2= Cortez|first=Susan |first2= Michelle|date=April 28, 2018|website=Bloomberg|access-date=September 2, 2018}}</ref> In September 2018, the appeals court decided in favor of the Broad Institute's patent.<ref>Jeff Akst, (2018) "The higher court's decision to uphold the ruling of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board essentially ends the intellectual property battle in theUS"  ''The Scientist'', September 10, 2018.</ref> Meanwhile, UC Berkeley and co-applicants' patent to cover the general technique was also granted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cariboubio.com/in-the-news/press-releases/crispr-therapeutics-intellia-therapeutics-and-caribou-biosciences-announce|title=CRISPR Therapeutics, Intellia Therapeutics, and Caribou Biosciences announce grant of US patent for CRISPR/Cas9 Genome Editing|last=Paganelli|first=Jennifer|date=June 19, 2018|website=Caribou Biosciences, Inc|access-date=September 2, 2018}}</ref> To further cloud the issue, in Europe the claim of the Broad Institute, to have initiated the research first, was disallowed.<ref name=":5" /> The rejection was due to a procedural flaw in the application involving a different set of personnel listed in the lawsuit and the patent application, leading to speculation that the UC Berkeley group would prevail in Europe.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/01/broad-institute-takes-hit-european-crispr-patent-struggle|title=Broad Institute takes a hit in European CRISPR patent struggle|last=Servick|first=Kelly|date=January 18, 2018|website=Science|access-date=September 2, 2018}}</ref> Doudna cofounded Caribou Biosciences, a company to commercialize CRISPR technology, in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=272189231|title=Caribou Biosciences, Inc|website=Bloomberg business|access-date=September 2, 2018}}</ref> In September 2013, Doudna cofounded [[Editas Medicine]] with Zhang and others despite their legal battles, but she quit in June 2014;

=== COVID-19 response ===
Beginning in March 2020, Doudna organized an effort to use CRISPR-based technologies to address the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] along with Dave Savage, [[Robert Tjian]], and other colleagues at the Innovative Genomics Institute (IGI), where they created a testing center.{{sfn|Isaacson|2021|p=401}} This center processes more than 1,000 patient samples per day.<ref>{{Cite web|title=CRISPR pioneer Doudna opens COVID-19 testing lab – BioNews|url=https://www.bionews.org.uk/page_148961|website=www.bionews.org.uk|access-date=May 2, 2020}}</ref> Mammoth Biosciences announced a peer-reviewed validation of a rapid, CRISPR-based point of need COVID-19 diagnostic which is faster and less expensive than [[Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction|qRT-PCR]] based tests.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Mammoth Biosciences Announces Peer-Reviewed Validation Of Its Rapid, CRISPR-Based COVID-19 Diagnostic|url=https://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=258059|last=Release|first=Press|date=April 21, 2020|website=SynBioBeta|language=en-US|access-date=May 2, 2020}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Doudna's first marriage was in 1988 to a fellow graduate student at Harvard named Tom Griffin, but his interests were more broad and less focused on research than hers and they divorced a few years later. Griffin wanted to move to [[Boulder, Colorado]], where Doudna was also interested in working with [[Thomas Cech]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2021|pp=54–55}} As a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Colorado, Doudna met Jamie Cate, then a graduate student; they worked together on the project to crystallize and determine the structure of the Tetrahymena Group I intron P4-P6 catalytic region. Doudna brought Cate with her to Yale, and they married in Hawaii in 2000. Cate later became a professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and Doudna followed him to Boston at Harvard, but in 2002 they both accepted faculty positions at Berkeley and moved there together; Cate preferred the less formal environment on the West Coast from his earlier experiences at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] and the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]], and Doudna liked that Berkeley is a [[public university]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2021|pp=63–66}} Cate is currently a Berkeley professor and works on gene-editing yeast to increase their cellulose fermentation for biofuel production. Doudna and Cate have a son born in 2002 who now attends the University of California, Berkeley and is studying Electrical Engineering and Computer Science.<ref name=":0" />
