'''John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|sep=,|OM|PC|PRS}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|eɪ|l|i}}; 12 November 1842&nbsp;– 30 June 1919) was a British scientist who made extensive contributions to both [[Theoretical physics|theoretical]] and [[experimental physics]].  He spent all of his academic career at the [[University of Cambridge]].  Among many honors, he received the 1904 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] "for his investigations of the densities of the most important gases and for his discovery of [[argon]] in connection with these studies."  He served as President of the [[Royal Society]] from 1905 to 1908 and as Chancellor of the University of Cambridge from 1908 to 1919.

Rayleigh provided the first theoretical treatment of the elastic scattering of light by particles much smaller than the light's wavelength, a phenomenon now known as "[[Rayleigh scattering]]", which notably explains why the sky is blue.  He studied and described transverse [[surface wave]]s in solids, now known as "[[Rayleigh wave]]s".  He contributed extensively to [[fluid dynamics]], with concepts such as the [[Rayleigh number]] (a [[dimensionless number]] associated with [[natural convection]]), [[Rayleigh flow]], the [[Rayleigh–Taylor instability]], and Rayleigh's criterion for the stability of [[Taylor–Couette flow]].  He also formulated the circulation theory of [[Lift (force)|aerodynamic lift]].  In [[optics]], Rayleigh proposed a well known criterion for [[angular resolution]].  His derivation of the [[Rayleigh–Jeans law]] for classical black-body radiation later played an important role in the birth of [[quantum mechanics]] (see [[Ultraviolet catastrophe]]).  Rayleigh's textbook ''The Theory of Sound'' (1877) is still used today by [[Acoustics|acousticians]] and engineers.

==Biography==
Strutt was born on 12 November 1842 at Langford Grove in [[Maldon, Essex]]. In his early years he suffered from frailty and poor health.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=The Popular Science Monthly |title=Sketch of Lord Rayleigh |pages=840 ''ff'' |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fiwDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA840 |date=October 1884 |volume=25 |issue=46 |publisher=Bonnier Corporation}}</ref> He attended [[Eton College]] and [[Harrow School]] (each for only a short period),<ref name=prixnobel/> before going on to the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1861 where he studied mathematics at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. He obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree ([[Senior Wrangler]] and 1st [[Smith's Prize]]) in 1865, and a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|Master of Arts]] in 1868.<ref>

He had three sons with her.<ref name=prixnobel>One son, [[Robert Strutt, 4th Baron Rayleigh]], was also an eminent physicist and fellow of the Royal Society.

}}</ref> In 1873, on the death of his father, John Strutt, 2nd Baron Rayleigh, he inherited the [[Baron Rayleigh|Barony of Rayleigh]].

He was the second [[Cavendish Professor of Physics]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] (following [[James Clerk Maxwell]]), from 1879 to 1884. He first described [[dynamic soaring]] by [[seabirds]] in 1883, in the British journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.<ref name=soaring>{{cite journal|author-last=RAYLEIGH|author-link=John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|title=The soaring of birds|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|year=1883|volume=27|issue=701|pages=534–535|doi=10.1038/027534a0|bibcode=1883Natur..27..534R|s2cid=45898842|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/027534a0|doi-access=free}}</ref> From 1887 to 1905 he was professor of [[Natural Philosophy]] at the [[Royal Institution]].

Around the year 1900 Rayleigh developed the ''duplex'' (combination of two) theory of human sound localisation using two [[binaural beats|binaural cues]], [[interaural time difference|interaural phase difference]] (IPD) and [[interaural level difference]] (ILD) (based on analysis of a spherical head with no external [[Pinna (anatomy)|pinnae]]). The theory posits that we use two primary cues for sound lateralisation, using the difference in the phases of [[Sine wave|sinusoid]]al components of the sound and the difference in amplitude (level) between the two ears.

In 1904 he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] "for his investigations of the densities of the most important gases and for his discovery of [[argon]] in connection with these studies".

During the [[First World War]], he was president of the government's [[Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]], which was located at the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]], and chaired by [[Richard Glazebrook]].<ref>{{Cite book| publisher=Constable and company Limited |last=Lanchester |first=Frederick William |author-link= Frederick W.

In 1919, Rayleigh served as president of the [[Society for Psychical Research]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Past Presidents|url=http://www.spr.ac.uk/page/past-presidents-parapsychology|publisher=Society for Psychical Research|access-date=19 November 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223112644/http://www.spr.ac.uk/page/past-presidents-parapsychology|archive-date=23 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> As an advocate that simplicity and theory be part of the scientific method, Rayleigh argued for the [[principle of similitude]].

Rayleigh was elected fellow of the [[Royal Society]] on 12 June 1873, and served as president of the Royal Society from 1905 to 1908. From time to time he participated in the [[House of Lords]]; however, he spoke up only if politics attempted to become involved in science.

Many of the papers that he wrote on [[lubrication]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rayleigh|first=Lord|date=1918|title=I. Notes on the theory of lubrication|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14786440108635730|journal=The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science|language=en|volume=35|issue=205|pages=1–12|doi=10.1080/14786440108635730|via=}}</ref> are now recognized as early classical contributions to the field of [[tribology]]. For these contributions, he was named as one of the 23 "Men of Tribology" by [[Duncan Dowson]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dowson|first=Duncan|date=1979-01-01|title=Men of Tribology: John William Strutt (Lord Rayleigh) (1842–1919) and Beauchamp Tower (1845–1904)|url=https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/tribology/article/101/1/1/430997/Men-of-Tribology-John-William-Strutt-Lord-Rayleigh|journal=Journal of Lubrication Technology|language=en|volume=101|issue=1|pages=1–7|doi=10.1115/1.3453272|issn=0022-2305|doi-access=free}}</ref>

He died on 30 June 1919, at his home in [[Witham]], Essex.<ref name=prixnobel/><ref>{{cite web |title=John Strutt, Lord Rayleigh |url=https://www.westminster-abbey.org/abbey-commemorations/commemorations/john-strutt-lord-rayleigh |website=Westminster Abbey |access-date=7 May 2019 |language=en}}</ref> He was succeeded, as the 4th Lord Rayleigh, by his son [[Robert John Strutt]], another well-known physicist. Lord Rayleigh was buried in the graveyard of All Saints' Church in [[Terling]] in Essex.

There is a memorial to him by [[Derwent Wood]] in St Andrew's Chapel at [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>''The Abbey Scientists'', Hall, A. R. p. 59: London; Roger & Robert Nicholson; 1966</ref>

==Religious views==
Rayleigh was an [[Anglican]]. Though he did not write about the relationship of science and religion, he retained a personal interest in spiritual matters.<ref>Peter J. Bowler (2014). ''Reconciling Science and Religion: The Debate in Early-Twentieth-Century Britain'', University of Chicago Press. p. 35</ref> When his scientific papers were to be published in a collection by the [[Cambridge University Press]], Strutt wanted to include a religious quotation from the [[Bible]], but he was discouraged from doing so, as he later reported:

{{quote|When I was bringing out my ''Scientific Papers'' I proposed a motto from the [[Psalms]], ''"The Works of the Lord are great, sought out of all them that have pleasure therein."'' The Secretary to the Press suggested with many apologies that the reader might suppose that I was the Lord.<ref>Robert John Strutt Baron Rayleigh (1924).

Arnold & Company, p. 307</ref><ref>Lord Rayleigh (Robert John Strutt), John William Strutt Baron Rayleigh (1964). "An Appraisal of Rayleigh", Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories, Office of Aerospace Research, U.S. Air Force. p. 1150.</ref>}}

Still, he had his wish and the quotation was printed in the five-volume collection of scientific papers. In a letter to a family member, he wrote about his rejection of [[materialism]] and spoke of [[Jesus Christ]] as a moral teacher:

{{quote|I have never thought the materialist view possible, and I look to a power beyond what we see, and to a life in which we may at least hope to take part. What is more, I think that Christ and indeed other spiritually gifted men see further and truer than I do, and I wish to follow them as far as I can.|Rayleigh (1910)<ref>Melba Phillips (1992), ''The Life and Times of Modern Physics: History of Physics II''.

''Ninety Years of Family Farming: The Story of Lord Rayleigh's and Strutt & Parker Farms''. Hutchinson, p. 37</ref>}}

He held an interest in [[parapsychology]] and was an early member of the [[Society for Psychical Research]] (SPR). He was not convinced of [[spiritualism]] but remained open to the possibility of [[supernatural]] phenomena.<ref>DeYoung, Ursula. (2011).

Palgrave Macmillan. p. 178. {{ISBN|978-0-230-11053-3}}</ref> Rayleigh was the president of the SPR in 1919.
