==Education==
Andre Geim was born to Konstantin Alekseyevich Geim and Nina Nikolayevna Bayer in [[Sochi]], Russia, on 21 October 1958. Both his parents were engineers of German origin.<ref name=NobelBio>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/geim-bio.html|title=Andre Geim – Biographical|work=nobelprize.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rg-rb.de/2010/42/odi.shtml |title=RG-RB – 42 |publisher=Rg-rb.de |access-date=30 October 2010}}</ref> His grandfather N.N.

He said that at the time he would not have chosen to study [[solid-state physics]], preferring particle physics or astrophysics, but is now happy with his choice.<ref name=Murphy/> He received a [[diplom]] ([[Master of Science|MSc]] degree equivalent) from MIPT in 1982 and a [[Candidate of Sciences]] (PhD equivalent) degree in [[metal physics]] in 1987 from the [[Institute of Solid State Physics (Russia)|Institute of Solid State Physics]] (ISSP) at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] (RAS) in [[Chernogolovka]].<ref name=Murphy>Murphy, John.

==Academic career==
After earning his PhD with Victor Petrashov,<ref name="bbcprofile"/> Geim worked as a research scientist at the Institute for Microelectronics Technology (IMT) at RAS, and from 1990 as a post-doctoral fellow at the universities of [[University of Nottingham|Nottingham]] (twice), [[University of Bath|Bath]], and [[University of Copenhagen|Copenhagen]]. He said that while at Nottingham he could spend his time on research rather than "swimming through Soviet treacle,"<ref name =NobelBio /> and determined to leave the Soviet Union.<ref name=PhysicsWorld>[https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-7058/19/2/15 "A physicist of many talents"]. ''[[Physics World]]''. February 2006. Retrieved 24 October 2010.</ref>

He obtained his first tenured position in 1994, when he was appointed associate professor at [[Radboud University Nijmegen]], where he worked on [[mesoscopic physics|mesoscopic]] [[superconductivity]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Geim | first1 = A. | last2 = Dubonos | first2 = S. | last3 = Palacios | first3 = J. | last4 = Grigorieva Iv | first4 = I. | last5 = Henini | first5 = M. | last6 = Schermer | first6 = J. | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.85.1528 | title = Fine Structure in Magnetization of Individual Fluxoid States | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 85 | issue = 7 | pages = 1528–1531 | year = 2000 | pmid =  10970546|arxiv = cond-mat/0001129 |bibcode = 2000PhRvL..85.1528G | s2cid = 46281431 }}</ref> He later gained Dutch citizenship. One of his doctoral students at Nijmegen was [[Konstantin Novoselov]], who went on to become his main research partner. However, Geim has said that he had an unpleasant time during his academic career in the Netherlands.

He was offered professorships at Nijmegen and [[Eindhoven]], but turned them down as he found the Dutch academic system too hierarchical and full of petty politicking. "This can be pretty unpleasant at times," he says. "It's not like the British system where every staff member is an equal quantity."<ref name="PhysicsWorld" /> On the other hand, Geim writes in his Nobel lecture that "the situation was a bit surreal because outside the university walls I received a warm-hearted welcome from everyone around, including Jan Kees and other academics."<ref name=NobelLecture>Nobel lecture http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/geim_lecture.pdf</ref> (Prof. Jan Kees Maan was the research boss of Geim during his time at Radboud University Nijmegen.)

In 2001 he became a professor of physics at the [[University of Manchester]], and was appointed director of the Manchester Centre for Mesoscience and Nanotechnology in 2002. Geim's wife and long-standing co-author, [[Irina Grigorieva (academic)|Irina Grigorieva]], also moved to Manchester as a lecturer in 2001. The same year, they were joined by Novoselov who moved to Manchester from Nijmegen, which awarded him a PhD in 2004. Geim served as [[Langworthy Professor]] between 2007 and 2013, leaving this endowed professorship to Novoselov in 2012.<ref name=CV/> Also, between 2007 and 2010 Geim was an [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council|EPSRC]] Senior Research Fellow before becoming one of [[Royal Society]] Research Professors.<ref name=CV/><ref name="epsrc">{{cite web|url=http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=84019 |title=Grants awarded to Andre Geim by the EPRSC |archive-date=13 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213091016/http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewPerson.aspx?PersonId=84019 |url-status=live  }}</ref>

He said of the range of subjects he has studied: "Many people choose a subject for their PhD and then continue the same subject until they retire. I despise this approach.

Expanding the scope of his research adventures, Geim started studying low-dimensional water in 2012, after his Nobel-prize achievements.

He has recently discovered a conceptually new class of materials strictly two-dimensional atomic crystals, including graphene. This has opened up a prolific research area including a new paradigm of "relativistic-like condensed matter", where relativistic quantum physics can be studied in a bench-top experiment. Previously, Geim pioneered ballistic Hall micromagnetometry and discovered a paramagnetic Meissner effect and new vortex physics in superconductors. He has also realised a microfabricated adhesive, based on the gecko's climbing mechanism, now being exploited by [[DuPont]], [[BAE Systems|BAe]] and TESA. His experiments at [[Nijmegen]] on magnetic levitation attracted worldwide media attention and stimulated international research in this field. His earlier research on mesoscopic physics included studies of non-local and interaction phenomena, and of the quantum motion of electrons in periodic and random magnetic fields. He disseminates science to the public and schoolchildren through broadcasts and "roadshow" lectures.<ref name=frs/>}}

==Personal life==

===View and opinions===
Geim was one of 38 Nobel laureates who signed a declaration in 2010 issued by Scholars for Peace in the Middle East protesting an international initiative to [[Academic boycotts of Israel|boycott]] Israeli academics, institutions, and research centers.<ref>[http://www.spme.net/cgi-bin/articles.cgi?ID=7322 Statement]. Scholars for Peace in the Middle East. 28 October 2010. Retrieved 10 July 2011.</ref>

At the ''Nobel Minds'' symposium in December 2010, Geim said the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] committee's choice of Chinese dissident, the imprisoned [[Liu Xiaobo]], as winner of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], was patronising, saying 
<blockquote>"Look at the people who give this Nobel prize. They are retired Norwegian politicians who have spent all their careers in a safe environment, in an oil-rich modern country. They try to extend their views of the world, how the world should work and how democracy works in another country. It's very, very patronising— they have not lived in these countries. In the past 10 years, China has developed not only economically, but even the strongest human rights supporter would agree also human rights have improved. Why do we need to distort this?"<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/mediaplayer/index.php?id=1469 "2010 Nobel Minds"]. nobelprize.org. Passage begins at about 19:00. Retrieved 10 July 2011.</ref><ref>Bannerman, Lucy.

''[[The Australian]]''. 13 December 2010. Retrieved 10 July 2011.</ref></blockquote>

Geim has written several opinion pieces for ''[[The Financial Times]]'', examples of which can be found on his university webpage.<ref>{{URL|http://www.condmat.physics.manchester.ac.uk/people/academic/geim/}}</ref>

In 2014, Geim's interview for [[Desert Island Discs]], a popular BBC radio programme, revealed details of his personal life and taste in music.<ref>{{URL|http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/desert-island-discs/castaway/20e3bf76#b03z3l2g}}</ref>

A quote from Geim was deliberately doctored by the campaign group [[Vote Leave]] in the run-up to the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum]]. An open letter about science, signed by 13 Conservative MPs including [[Boris Johnson]], attempted to paint European science funding as unnecessarily bureaucratic and deliberately misrepresented Geim's views on Europe:

<blockquote>As the Nobel Prize winner Andre Geim said: 'I can offer no nice words for the EU framework programmes <nowiki>[for research]</nowiki> which ... can be praised only by Europhobes for discrediting the whole idea of an effectively working Europe.'</blockquote>

The [[ellipsis]] (...) present in the quotation from Geim's Nobel lecture removed the words "except for the [[European Research Council]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/dominic-cummings-science-obsession-based-fact-or-fiction|title=Dominic Cummings' science obsession: based on fact or fiction?|date=16 October 2019|website=Times Higher Education (THE)|language=en|access-date=25 November 2019}}</ref>

===Identity===
Geim has a complex ancestry which is described in detail in his Nobel Prize [[autobiography]].<ref name = "NobelBio" /> In there, Geim has stated that most of his family are [[ethnic Germans]] where his father descended from [[Volga German]]s and his mother was mostly an [[ethnic German]] as well. Both his father and paternal grandfather had spent many years of their lives as prisoners in [[Siberia]] in [[Stalin]]'s [[Gulags]], and "some of the family had been prisoners in German concentration camps". He also states that he "suffered from [[Antisemitism in the Soviet Union|anti-Semitism in Russia]] because my name sounds Jewish".<ref>{{cite web | first=Gali | last=Weinreb | title=Nobel Laureate Geim: Life sciences suited for small countries | publisher=[[Globes (newspaper)|Globes]] | date=16 November 2010 | url=http://www.globes.co.il/serveen/globes/docview.asp?did=1000600865 | access-date=13 December 2019 }}</ref>

Geim summarises his identity as follows. "To the best of my knowledge, the only Jew in the family was my great-grandmother, with the rest on both sides being German. Having lived and worked in several European countries, I consider myself European and do not believe that any further [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] is necessary, especially in such a fluid world as the world of science."<ref name = "NobelBio" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Business/BusinessNews/Article.aspx?id=196080|title=Nobel laureate: Life sciences suited to small countries|work=The Jerusalem Post - JPost.com}}</ref>
