Smith was born on August 23, 1931, and graduated from [[University Laboratory High School of Urbana, Illinois]]. He attended the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], but in 1950 transferred to the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in Mathematics in 1952 [http://cal.berkeley.edu].  He received his medical degree from [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]] in 1956. Between 1956 and 1957 Smith worked for the [[Washington University in St. Louis]] Medical Service. In 1975, he was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] he spent at the [[University of Zurich]].

In 1970, Smith and Kent W. Wilcox discovered the first type II [[restriction enzyme]],<ref>{{Cite journal | author = Smith H, Wilcox KW | title = A Restriction enzyme from Hemophilus influenzae *1I. Purification and general properties | journal = [[Journal of Molecular Biology]] | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 379–391 | year = 1970 | pmid = 5312500 | doi = 10.1016/0022-2836(70)90149-X}}</ref> that is now called as [[HindII]].<ref name="Gitschier 2012"/> Smith went on to discover DNA [[methylase]]s that constitute the other half of the bacterial host restriction and modification systems, as hypothesized by [[Werner Arber]] of Switzerland.<ref name="Gitschier 2012"/>

He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1978 for discovering type II [[restriction enzyme]]s with [[Werner Arber]] and [[Daniel Nathans]] as co-recipients.

He later became a leading figure in the nascent field of [[genomics]], when in 1995 he and a team at [[The Institute for Genomic Research]] sequenced the first [[bacteria]]l [[genome]], that of ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=1330118|year=1992|last1=Smith|first1=H. O.|title=A restriction enzyme from Hemophilus influenzae. I. Purification and general properties. 1970|journal=Biotechnology (Reading, Mass.)|volume=24|pages=38–50|last2=Wilcox|first2=K. W.}}</ref> ''H. influenza'' was the same organism in which Smith had discovered restriction enzymes in the late 1960s.  He subsequently played a key role in the sequencing of many of the early genomes at The Institute for Genomic Research, and in the assembly of the [[human genome]] at [[Celera Genomics]], which he joined when it was founded in 1998.

More recently, he has directed a team at the [[J. Craig Venter Institute]] that works towards creating a partially [[synthetic biology|synthetic]] bacterium, ''[[Mycoplasma laboratorium]]''. In 2003 the same group synthetically assembled the genome of a virus, [[Phi X 174]] [[bacteriophage]].  Currently, Smith is scientific director of privately held [[Synthetic Genomics]], which was founded in 2005 by [[Craig Venter]] to continue this work.  Currently, Synthetic Genomics is working to produce [[biofuel]]s on an industrial-scale using recombinant [[algae]] and other microorganisms.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xconomy.com/san-diego/2009/06/04/craig-venter-has-algae-biofuel-in-synthetic-genomics-pipeline/|title=Craig Venter Has Algae Biofuel in Synthetic Genomics' Pipeline - Xconomy|work=Xconomy}}</ref>
