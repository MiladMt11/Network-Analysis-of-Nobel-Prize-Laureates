==Education==
Rothman earned his high school diploma from [[Pomfret School]] in 1967, then received his B.A. in physics at [[Yale University]] in 1971 and his Ph.D. in biological chemistry at [[Harvard]] in 1976 working with Eugene Patrick Kennedy.<ref name="Yale nobel announcement"/>

==Career and research==
Following his Ph.D., Rothman did [[postdoctoral research]] with [[Harvey Lodish]] at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] working on [[glycosylation]] of [[Membrane protein|membrane proteins]].<ref name="bio"/><ref name="Yale nobel announcement">{{cite news|title=Yale's James Rothman shares 2013 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|url=http://news.yale.edu/2013/10/07/yale-s-james-rothman-shares-2013-nobel-prize-physiology-or-medicine|access-date=October 7, 2013|newspaper=Yale News|date=October 7, 2013}}</ref> He moved to the Department of Biochemistry at [[Stanford University]] in 1978. He was at [[Princeton University]], from 1988 to 1991, before coming to New York to found the Department of Cellular Biochemistry and Biophysics at [[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]], where he also served as vice-chairman of [[Sloan-Kettering Institute]]. In 2003, he left Sloan-Kettering to become a professor of physiology at [[Columbia University]]'s [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons|College of Physicians and Surgeons]] and the head of Columbia's Center for Chemical Biology.<ref name="Columbia Newsroom">{{cite web|title=Leading Cell Biologist Joins Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons|url=http://newsroom.cumc.columbia.edu/2003/06/09/leading-cell-biologist-joins-faculty-at-columbia-university-college-of-physicians-surgeons-3/|newspaper=Columbia Medical Center Newsroom | access-date=October 13, 2013}}</ref> He moved from Columbia to Yale in 2008, retaining a part-time appointment at Columbia.

Rothman's research<ref name="scopus">{{Scopus|id=7103209478}}</ref> details how vesicles—tiny sac-like structures that transport hormones, growth factors, and other molecules within cells—know how to reach their correct destination and where and when to release their contents. This cellular trafficking underlies many critical physiological functions, including the propagation of the cell itself in division, communication between nerve cells in the brain, secretion of insulin and other hormones in the body, and nutrient uptake. Defects in this process lead to a wide variety of conditions, including diabetes and [[botulism]].

==Awards and honors==
Rothman was awarded the 2010 [[Kavli Prize]] Neuroscience together with [[Richard Scheller]] and [[Thomas C. Südhof]] for "discovering the molecular basis of neurotransmitters release".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kavliprize.no//artikkel/vis.html?tid=49288 |title=JAMES ROTHMAN |publisher=Kavlifoundation.org |date=September 6, 2010 |access-date=October 7, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015034337/http://www.kavliprize.no//artikkel/vis.html?tid=49288 |archive-date=October 15, 2013  }}</ref>
