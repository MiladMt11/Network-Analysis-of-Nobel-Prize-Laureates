'''Leland Harrison (Lee) Hartwell''' (born October 30, 1939 in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]) is former president and director of the [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. He shared the 2001 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] with [[Paul Nurse]] and [[Tim Hunt]], for their discoveries of protein molecules that control the division (duplication) of cells.<ref name="illpres">{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2001/illpres/index.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2001, Illustrated Lecture}}</ref>

Working in yeast, Hartwell identified the fundamental role of checkpoints in cell cycle control, and CDC genes such as CDC28, which controls the start of the cycle—the progression through G1.<ref name="illpres"/>

==Education==
Hartwell attended [[Glendale High School (Glendale, California)|Glendale High School]] in [[Glendale, California]],<ref>{{cite web | last = Paulson | first = Tom | title = It's Now Dr. Hartwell, Nobel Laureate | publisher = Seattle Post-Intelligencer | date = October 8, 2001 | url = http://www.seattlepi.com/local/article/It-s-now-Dr-Hartwell-Nobel-laureate-1068155.php}}</ref> and then received his [[Bachelor of Science]] from the [[California Institute of Technology]] in 1961. In 1964, he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in [[biology]] from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. From 1965 to 1968, he worked at the [[University of California, Irvine]] as a professor. He moved to the [[University of Washington]] in 1968. In a series of experiments from 1970 to 1971, Hartwell discovered the [[cell division cycle]] (''CDC'') genes in [[baker's yeast]] (''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]''). These genes regulate the cell cycle and [[mutation]]s in the genes are involved in some types of [[cancer]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hartwell LH, Culotti J, Reid B |title=Genetic control of the cell-division cycle in yeast.

==Awards and honors==

In addition to the [[Nobel Prize]], Hartwell has received many awards and honors including the [[Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1995.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/horwitz/ |title= The Official Site of Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize|date= June 14, 2018}}</ref> He became a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1987. In 1996, Hartwell joined the faculty of [[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]] and in 1997 became its president and director until he retired in 2010.<ref>Luke Timmerman for Xconomy.

In 1998 he received the [[Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research]], and the [[Massry Prize]] from the [[Keck School of Medicine]], [[University of Southern California]] in 2000.  On July 9, 2003, [[Washington (state)|Washington]] Governor [[Gary Locke]] awarded the Medal of Merit, the state's highest honor, to Hartwell. He is also a recipient of the [[Komen Brinker Award for Scientific Distinction]].

==Research==
His earliest publications focused on the isolation of temperature sensitive yeast mutants disabled in basic biological processes, including DNA, RNA and protein synthesis.<ref>{{cite journal | journal= Journal of Bacteriology | date=1967 | title=Macromolecule synthesis in temperature-sensitive mutants of yeast | author=Hartwell LH | volume=93 |issue=5 |pages=1662–70 | doi=10.1128/JB.93.5.1662-1670.1967 | pmid= 5337848 | pmc=276664}}</ref> This led to the identification of the CDC (Cell Division Cycle) genes, which function in promoting the progression through cell division, most notably CDC28, which encodes the yeast Cdk kinase.  Other significant discoveries include introduction of the concept of cell cycle "checkpoints", which delay cell division when cellular insults are generated and also the identification and characterization of the mating signal transduction pathway.

==Other positions==

Hartwell is the Chairman of the Scientific Advisory Board at the [[Canary Foundation]], a non-profit organization dedicated to developing new technologies for the early detection of [[cancer]]. He is also a founding co-chair of the [[Pacific Health Summit]], and a member of its Executive Committee.<ref>[http://www.pacifichealthsummit.org/about/About_the_Pacific_Health_Summit.pdf Pacific Health Summit, About the Summit, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054410/http://pacifichealthsummit.org/about/About_the_Pacific_Health_Summit.pdf |date=March 4, 2016 }}</ref> In September 2009, it was announced that Hartwell would join the faculty of [[Arizona State University]] as the Virginia G. Piper Chair of Personalized Medicine and co-director of the [[Biodesign Institute]]'s Center for Sustainable Health with Dr. Michael Birt.<ref>[http://asunews.asu.edu/20090908_hartwell Hartwell to join ASU faculty] ASU News</ref><ref>[http://biodesign.asu.edu/news/arizona-state-university-and-virginia-g-piper-charitable-trust-tap-nobel-prize-winner-dr-lee-hartwell-to-lead-major-health-initiative Arizona State University and Virginia G.
