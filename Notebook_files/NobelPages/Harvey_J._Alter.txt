'''Harvey James Alter''' (born September 12, 1935) is an American [[medical researcher]], [[virologist]], [[physician]] and [[Nobel Prize]] laureate, who is best known for his work that led to the discovery of the [[hepatitis C virus]].<ref name="HarrisHarris2013">{{cite book|author1=McHenry Harris|author2=Randall E.

In the mid-1970s, Alter and his research team demonstrated that most post-transfusion [[hepatitis]] cases were not due to [[hepatitis A]] or [[hepatitis B]] viruses. Working independently, Alter and Edward Tabor, a scientist at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, proved through transmission studies in chimpanzees that a new form of hepatitis, initially called "non-A, non-B hepatitis" caused the infections, and that the causative agent was probably a virus. This work eventually led to the discovery of the hepatitis C virus in 1988,<ref name="HarrisHarris2013" /> for which he shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 2020 along with [[Michael Houghton (virologist)|Michael Houghton]] and [[Charles M.

Speaking of Alter's long research career at the time of the 2000 Lasker Award, [[Harvey Klein]], chief of the Clinical Center Transfusion Medicine Department noted, "As a young research fellow, Dr. Alter co-discovered the Australia antigen, a key to detecting Hepatitis B virus. For many investigators that would be the highlight of a career. For Dr. Alter it was only an auspicious beginning."<ref name=ClinicalCenter>[http://clinicalcenter.nih.gov/about/news/newsletter/2000/oct00/ Clinical Center News October 2000]</ref>

Alter was awarded the 2020 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine alongside [[Michael Houghton (virologist)|Michael Houghton]] and [[Charles M. Rice]] for "discoveries that led to the identification of [the] Hepatitis C virus."<ref name=Nobel />
