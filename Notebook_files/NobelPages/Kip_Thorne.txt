Thorne was born on June 1, 1940, in [[Logan, Utah]].{{cn|date=May 2021}} His father, D. Wynne Thorne (1908–1979), was a professor of soil chemistry at [[Utah State University]], and his mother, Alison (née Comish; 1914–2004), was an economist and the first woman to receive a [[Ph.D.]] in economics from [[Iowa State University|Iowa State College]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Kip S.

Regarding his views on science and religion, Thorne has stated: "There are large numbers of my finest colleagues who are quite devout and believe in God .... There is no fundamental incompatibility between science and religion.  I happen to not believe in God."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kip Thorne: physicist studying time travel tapped for Hollywood film |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/jun/21/kip-thorne-time-travel-scientist-film |last=Rory Carroll |date=June 21, 2013 |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |access-date=October 30, 2014 |quote=Thorne grew up in an academic, Mormon family in Utah but is now an atheist.

Thorne returned to Caltech as an associate professor in 1967 and became a professor of theoretical physics in 1970, becoming one of the youngest full professors in the history of Caltech at age 30. He became the William R. Kenan,&nbsp;Jr. Professor in 1981, and the [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]] Professor of Theoretical Physics in 1991. He was an adjunct professor at the [[University of Utah]] from 1971 to 1998 and Andrew D. White Professor at Large at [[Cornell University]] from 1986 to 1992.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kip S. Thorne |url=https://history.aip.org/phn/11605009.html |website=history.aip.org}}</ref> In June 2009, he resigned his Feynman Professorship (he is now the Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics, Emeritus) to pursue a career of writing and movie making.{{Citation needed|reason=|date=October 2017}} His first film project was ''[[Interstellar (film)|Interstellar]]'', on which he worked with [[Christopher Nolan]] and [[Jonathan Nolan]].<ref name="its.caltech.edu" />

Throughout the years, Thorne has served as a mentor and thesis advisor for many leading theorists who now work on observational, experimental, or astrophysical aspects of general relativity. Approximately 50 physicists have received Ph.D.s at Caltech under Thorne's personal mentorship.<ref name="its.caltech.edu" />

Thorne is known for his ability to convey the excitement and significance of discoveries in gravitation and astrophysics to both professional and lay audiences. His presentations on subjects such as [[black hole]]s, [[gravitational radiation]], [[theory of relativity|relativity]], [[time travel]], and [[wormhole]]s have been included in [[PBS]] shows in the U.S. and on the [[BBC]] in the United Kingdom.

Thorne and Linda Jean Peterson married in 1960. Their children are Kares Anne and Bret Carter, an architect. Thorne and Peterson divorced in 1977. Thorne and his second wife, Carolee Joyce Winstein, a professor of [[kinesiology|biokinesiology]] and physical therapy at [[University of Southern California|USC]], married in 1984.<ref name="Thorne_CV">{{Cite web |title=Kip S.

==Research==
[[File:Kip S. Thorne, 1972.jpg|thumb|Thorne in 1972]]
Thorne's research has principally focused on [[General relativity|relativistic]] [[Astrophysics#Theoretical astrophysics|astrophysics]] and [[Gravitation|gravitation physics]], with emphasis on [[relativistic star]]s, black holes and especially [[gravitational waves]].<ref name="its.caltech.edu" /> He is perhaps best known to the public for his controversial theory that wormholes can conceivably be used for time travel.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Cofield |first=Cala |date=December 19, 2014 |title=Time Travel and Wormholes:Physicist Kip Thorne's Wildest Theories |work=Space.com |url=http://www.space.com/28000-physicist-kip-thorne-wildest-theories.html}}</ref> However, Thorne's scientific contributions, which center on the general nature of [[space]], time, and [[gravity]], span the full range of topics in general relativity.

===Gravitational waves and LIGO===
Thorne's work has dealt with the prediction of gravitational wave strengths and their temporal signatures as observed on Earth. These "signatures" are of great relevance to [[LIGO]] (Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory), a multi-institution gravitational wave experiment for which Thorne has been a leading proponent – in 1984, he cofounded the LIGO Project (the largest project ever funded by the [[National Science Foundation|NSF]]<ref name="NSFcost">{{Cite web |title=LIGO: The Search for Gravitational Waves |url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=103042 |publisher=National Science Foundation |access-date=September 9, 2016 |quote=LIGO is the largest single enterprise undertaken by NSF, with capital investments of nearly $300 million and operating costs of more than $30 million/year.}}</ref>) to discern and measure any fluctuations between two or more 'static' points; such fluctuations would be evidence of gravitational waves, as calculations describe. A significant aspect of his research is developing the [[mathematics]] necessary to analyze these objects.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Catching waves with Kip Thorne |url=https://plus.maths.org/content/catching-waves-kip-thorne |date=December 1, 2001 |website=plus.maths.org |language=en |access-date=May 8, 2020}}</ref> Thorne also carries out [[engineering]] design analyses for features of the LIGO that cannot be developed on the basis of [[experiment]] and he gives advice on [[data analysis]] [[algorithm]]s by which the waves will be sought. He has provided theoretical support for LIGO, including identifying gravitational wave sources that LIGO should target, designing the baffles to control [[scattering|scattered light]] in the LIGO beam tubes, and – in collaboration with Vladimir Braginsky's (Moscow, Russia) research group – inventing [[Quantum Nondemolition measurement|quantum nondemolition]] designs for advanced gravity-wave detectors and ways to reduce the most serious kind of [[noise]] in advanced detectors: [[Johnson–Nyquist noise|thermoelastic noise]]. With [[Carlton M. Caves]], Thorne invented the back-action-evasion approach to quantum nondemolition measurements of the [[harmonic oscillator]]s – a technique applicable both in gravitational wave detection and [[quantum optics]].<ref name="its.caltech.edu" />

On February 11, 2016, a team of four physicists{{efn|The announcement team were Thorne, [[David Reitze]], [[Gabriela González]], [[Rainer Weiss]], and [[France A. Córdova]].}} representing the [[LIGO Scientific Collaboration]], announced that in September 2015, LIGO recorded the signature of two black holes colliding 1.3 billion light-years away.  This recorded detection was the first direct observation of the [[First observation of gravitational waves|fleeting chirp of a gravitational wave]] and confirmed an important prediction of Einstein's general theory of relativity.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gravitational Waves Detected 100 Years After Einstein's Prediction |url=https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/news/ligo20160211 |date=February 11, 2016 |publisher=ligo.caltech.edu}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Twilley |first=Nicola |title=Gravitational Waves Exist: The Inside Story of How Scientists Finally Found Them |work=The New Yorker |url=http://www.newyorker.com/tech/elements/gravitational-waves-exist-heres-how-scientists-finally-found-them |access-date=February 11, 2016 |issn=0028-792X}}</ref><ref name="PRL-20160211">{{Cite journal |last=Abbott, B.P. |display-authors=etal |year=2016 |title=Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger |journal=[[Phys.

===Black hole cosmology===
{{main|Hoop conjecture}}
[[File:Cylindrical Bundle of Magnetic Field Lines.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|A cylindrical bundle of magnetic field lines]]
While he was studying for his Ph.D. in Princeton University, his mentor John Wheeler gave him an assignment problem for him to think over: find out whether or not a cylindrical bundle of repulsive magnetic field lines will implode under its own attractive gravitational force.  After several months wrestling with the problem, he proved that it was impossible for cylindrical [[magnetic field]] lines to [[Implosion (mechanical process)|implode]].<ref name="Thorne1994" />{{rp|262–265}}

Why is it that a cylindrical bundle of magnetic field lines will not implode, while spherical stars will implode under their own gravitational force?  Thorne tried to explore the theoretical ridge between the two phenomena.  He found out eventually that the gravitational force can overcome all interior pressure only when an object has been compressed in all directions. To express this realization, Thorne proposed his [[hoop conjecture]], which describes an imploding star turning into a black hole when the critical circumference of the designed hoop can be placed around it and set into rotation. That is, any object of mass M around which a hoop of circumference <math>\begin{matrix} \frac{4 \pi GM}{c^2} \end{matrix}</math> can be spun must be a black hole.<ref name="Thorne1994">{{Cite book |last=Kip S.

As a tool to be used in both enterprises, astrophysics and theoretical physics, Thorne and his students have developed an unusual approach, called the "[[membrane paradigm]]", to the theory of black holes and used it to clarify the "Blandford-Znajek" mechanism by which black holes may power some [[quasar]]s and [[active galactic nuclei]].<ref name="Thorne1994" />{{rp|405–411}}

Thorne has investigated the [[quantum]] [[statistical mechanics|statistical mechanical]] origin of the [[entropy]] of a black hole. With his [[Postdoctoral researcher|postdoc]] Wojciech Zurek, he showed that the entropy of a black hole is the [[logarithm]] of the number of ways that the hole could have been made.<ref name="Thorne1994" />{{rp|445–446}}

With [[Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov|Igor Novikov]] and [[Don Page (physicist)|Don Page]], he developed the general relativistic theory of thin [[accretion disk]]s around black holes, and using this theory he deduced that with a doubling of its mass by such [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accretion]] a black hole will be spun up to 0.998 of the maximum [[spin (physics)|spin]] allowed by general relativity, but not any farther. This is probably the maximum black-hole spin allowed in nature.<ref name="its.caltech.edu" />

===Wormholes and time travel===
[[File:Wormhole-demo.png|thumb|upright=0.9|A wormhole is a short cut connecting two separate regions in space.  In the figure the green line shows the short way through wormhole, and the red line shows the long way through normal space.]]
Thorne and his co-workers at Caltech conducted scientific research on whether the laws of physics permit space and time to be [[Simply connected space|multiply connected]] (can there exist classical, [[Wormhole#Traversable wormholes|traversable wormholes]] and "time machines"?).<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Davies |first=Paul |date=February 1, 2006 |title=How to build a time machine |journal=Paul Davies |publisher=Scientific American |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=14–19 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0206-14sp|pmid=12197102 }}</ref> With Sung-Won Kim, Thorne identified a universal physical mechanism (the explosive growth of [[vacuum polarization]] of [[Field (physics)#Quantum fields|quantum field]]s), that may always prevent spacetime from developing [[closed timelike curve]]s (i.e., prevent [[time travel#Backward time travel in physics|backward time travel]]).<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Kim |first1=Sung-Won |last2=Thorne |first2=Kip S. |date=1991 |title=Do vacuum fluctuations prevent the creation of closed timelike curves? |url=http://authors.library.caltech.edu/4701/1/KIMprd91.pdf |journal=Physical Review D |volume=43 |issue=12 |pages=3929–3947 |bibcode=1991PhRvD..43.3929K |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.43.3929 |pmid=10013359}}</ref>

With Mike Morris and Ulvi Yurtsever, he showed that traversable wormholes can exist in the structure of [[spacetime]] only if they are threaded by quantum fields in [[quantum state]]s that violate the [[Energy condition#Mathematical statement|averaged null energy condition]] (i.e. have negative renormalized energy spread over a sufficiently large region).<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Morris |first1=Michael S. |last2=Thorne |first2=Kip S. |last3=Yurtsever |first3=Ulvi |date=1988 |title=Wormholes, Time Machines, and the Weak Energy Condition |url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/9262/1/MORprl88.pdf |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=61 |issue=13 |pages=1446–1449 |bibcode=1988PhRvL..61.1446M |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.61.1446 |pmid=10038800}}</ref> This has triggered research to explore the ability of quantum fields to possess such extended [[negative energy]]. Recent calculations by Thorne indicate that simple masses passing through traversable wormholes could never engender [[paradox]]es – there are ''no'' initial conditions that lead to paradox once time travel is introduced. If his results can be generalized, they would suggest that none of the supposed paradoxes formulated in time travel stories can actually be formulated at a precise physical level: that is, that ''any'' situation in a time travel story turns out to permit ''many'' consistent solutions.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

===Relativistic stars, multipole moments and other endeavors===
With [[Anna N. Żytkow|Anna Żytkow]], Thorne predicted the existence of [[Red giant|red supergiant star]]s with [[neutron star|neutron-star]] cores ([[Thorne–Żytkow object]]s).<ref name="tz77">{{Cite journal |last1=Thorne |first1=Kip S. |last2=Żytkow |first2=Anna N. |date=March 15, 1977 |title=Stars with degenerate neutron cores.

Thorne has also theoretically predicted the existence of universally antigravitating "[[exotic matter]]" – the element needed to accelerate the expansion rate of the universe, keep traversable wormhole "Star Gates" open and keep [[Minkowski space|timelike]] [[geodesic]] free float "[[Alcubierre drive|warp drive]]s" working. With Clifford Will<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Thorne |first1=Kip S. |last2=Will |first2=Clifford |date=1971 |title=Theoretical Frameworks for Testing Relativistic Gravity. I. Foundations |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=163 |pages=595–610 |bibcode=1971ApJ...163..595T |doi=10.1086/150803}}</ref> and others of his students, he laid the foundations for the theoretical interpretation of experimental [[tests of general relativity|tests of relativistic theories of gravity]] – foundations on which Will and others then built. {{As of|2005}}, Thorne was interested in the origin of classical space and time from the [[quantum foam]] of [[quantum gravity]] theory.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

*In [[Larry Niven]]'s novel ''[[Rainbow Mars]]'', the time travel technology used in the novel is based on the wormhole theories of Thorne, which in the context of the novel was when time travel first became possible, rather than just fantasy. As a result, any attempts to travel in time prior to Thorne's development of wormhole theory results in the time traveller entering a fantastic version of reality, rather than the actual past.<ref>Larry Niven. ''Rainbow Mars''. New York: [[Tor Books]], 1999, pp. 45, 366.</ref>
