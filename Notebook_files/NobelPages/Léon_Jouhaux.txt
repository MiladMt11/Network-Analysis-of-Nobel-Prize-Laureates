'''Léon Jouhaux''' (1 July 1879 – 28 April 1954) was a French [[trade union]] leader who received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1951.<ref name="nobel">[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1951/jouhaux/facts/ Nobel Committee information on Jouhaux]</ref>

==Biography==
Jouhaux was born in [[Pantin]], [[Seine-Saint-Denis]], France. Jouhaux's father worked in a match factory in [[Aubervilliers]]. His secondary schooling ended when his father's earnings were stopped by a strike. He gained employment at the factory at age sixteen and immediately became an important part of the union. In 1900, after serving a brief mandatory military sentence in [[French Algeria]], Jouhaux joined a [[strike action|strike]] against the use of the [[white phosphorus]] that [[blindness|blinded]] his father, was dismissed, and worked at a succession of jobs until union influence saw him reinstated.

In 1906, he was elected by the local union as a representative to the [[General Confederation of Labour (France)|General Confederation of Labour]] (CGT), where his abilities saw him quickly rise through the ranks of organized labour. By 1909 he became interim treasurer, and shortly afterwards became secretary-general of the organization, which he held until 1947. His goals as a [[trade union]]ist were the familiar ones of the early [[labour movement]] — the [[eight-hour day]], the right to [[union representative|union representation]] and [[collective bargaining]], and [[paid time off|paid holidays]]. During the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]], the [[Matignon Accords (1936)|1936 Matignon Agreement]], to which he was a signatory, awarded many of these rights to French workers.

In the years before [[World War II]], Jouhaux organised several mass protests, and the organization he led protested against the war. However, once the war started, Jouhaux supported his country and believed that a [[Nazi Germany]] victory would lead to the destruction of [[democracy]] in Europe. During the war, he was arrested and imprisoned in [[Buchenwald concentration camp]].

After the war, Jouhaux split from the CGT to form the social-democrat [[Workers' Force]] (CGT-FO). In 1951, he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace prize]].<ref name="nobel"/>

In an international context, his work was instrumental in the setting up of the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO), and was elected to high positions in international trade union bodies, including the [[International Federation of Trade Unions]] and its postwar kin the [[World Federation of Trade Unions]] until that body split.

On his passing in 1954, Léon Jouhaux was interred in [[Le Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris.

"I would not go so far as to say that the French trade unions attached greater importance to the struggle for peace than the others did; but they certainly seemed to take it more to heart."
