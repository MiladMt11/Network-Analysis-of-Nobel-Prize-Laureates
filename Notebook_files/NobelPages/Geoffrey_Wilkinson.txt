==Education and early life==
Wilkinson was born at Springside, [[Todmorden]], in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. His father, Henry Wilkinson, was a master [[house painter and decorator]]; his mother, Ruth, worked in a local [[cotton mill]]. One of his uncles, an organist and [[Conducting|choirmaster]], had married into a family that owned a small chemical company making [[Magnesium sulfate|Epsom]] and [[Sodium sulfate|Glauber]]'s salts for the [[pharmaceutical industry]]; this is where he first developed an interest in chemistry.

He was educated at the local council primary school and, after winning a County Scholarship in 1932, went to [[Todmorden Grammar School]]. His [[physics]] teacher there, Luke Sutcliffe, had also taught Sir [[John Cockcroft]], who received a Nobel Prize for "splitting the atom". In 1939 he obtained a Royal Scholarship for study at [[Imperial College London]], from where he graduated in 1941, with his PhD awarded in 1946 entitled "Some physico-chemical observations of hydrolysis in the homogeneous vapour phase".<ref>{{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.587112}}</ref><ref name="NobelFoundationBio" /><ref>{{cite web |title=GENEALOGY DATABASE ENTRY - Wikinson, Geoffrey |url=http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/Web_Genealogy/Info/wilkinsong.pdf |website=scs.illinois.edu |last1=Mainz |first1=Vera V. |last2=Girolami |first2=Gregory S. |date=1988}}</ref>

==Career and research==
In 1942 Professor [[Friedrich Paneth]] was recruiting young chemists for the [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] project. Wilkinson joined and was sent out to Canada, where he stayed in [[Montreal]] and later [[Chalk River Laboratories]] until he could leave in 1946. For the next four years he worked with Professor [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] at [[University of California, Berkeley]], mostly on nuclear taxonomy.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/643851/Sir-Geoffrey-Wilkinson |title = Sir Geoffrey Wilkinson &#124; British chemist}}</ref> He then became a Research Associate at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and began to return to his first interest as a student – [[Complex (chemistry)|transition metal complex]]es of [[ligand]]s such as [[carbon monoxide]] and [[olefin]]s.

He was at [[Harvard University]] from September 1951 until he returned to England in December 1955, with a sabbatical break of nine months in [[Copenhagen]]. At Harvard, he still did some nuclear work on excitation functions for [[proton]]s in [[cobalt]], but had already begun to work on olefin complexes.

In June 1955 he was appointed to the chair of Inorganic Chemistry at [[Imperial College London]], and from then on worked almost entirely on the complexes of transition metals.

Wilkinson is well known for his popularisation of the use of [[Wilkinson's catalyst]] RhCl(PPh<sub>3</sub>)<sub>3</sub> in catalytic hydrogenation, and for the discovery of the structure of [[ferrocene]]. Wilkinson's catalyst is used industrially in the [[hydrogenation]] of [[alkenes]] to [[alkanes]].<ref>{{cite journal |first=F.H. |last=Jardine |title=The Contributions of Sir Geoffrey Wilkinson, F.R.S., (1921–1996) to Rhodium Chemistry |journal=Rhodium Express |volume=16 |pages=4–10 |year=1996 |url=http://sites.google.com/site/rhodiumexpress/ |issn=	0869-7876}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Osborn|first= J.

He supervised PhD students and [[postdoctoral researcher]]s including [[John A. Osborn]], [[Alan Davison]]<ref name=davisonphd/><ref name=davison/> and [[Malcolm Green (chemist)|Malcolm Green]].<ref name=greenphd/>

==Awards and honours==
Wilkinson received many awards, including the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel Prize]] for Chemistry in 1973<ref name="NobelFoundationBio">{{cite web | title=Geoffrey Wilkinson - Autobiography | website=nobelprize.org | date=11 October 2012 | url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1973/wilkinson-autobio.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011193653/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1973/wilkinson-autobio.html | archive-date=11 October 2012 | url-status=dead | access-date=20 July 2021}}</ref> for his work on "[[organometallic compound]]s" (with [[Ernst Otto Fischer]]). He is also well known for writing, with his former doctoral student [[F. Albert Cotton]], "Advanced Inorganic Chemistry", often referred to simply as "Cotton and Wilkinson", one of the standard inorganic chemistry textbooks.<ref>{{Cite book

He was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1965|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1965]].<ref name="frs"/> In 1980 he was awarded an honorary doctorate of science from the [[University of Bath]]. Imperial College London named a new hall of residence after him, which opened in October 2009. Wilkinson Hall is named in his honour.<ref>[http://halls.ic.ac.uk/wilkinson Wilkinson Hall at Imperial College London]</ref>

==Personal life==
Wilkinson was married to Lise Schou, a Danish plant physiologist whom he had met at Berkeley. They had two daughters, Anne and Pernille.<ref name="frs"/>
