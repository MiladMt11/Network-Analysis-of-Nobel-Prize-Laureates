== Early life==
Ernst was born in [[Winterthur]], Switzerland on 14 August 1933<ref name=Nobel>{{cite web|title=Richard R. Ernst – Biographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1991/ernst/biographical/|accessdate=8 June 2021|publisher=Nobel Prize}}</ref> to Robert Ernst and Irma Ernst-Brunner.<ref name="Anthes">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/16/science/richard-r-ernst-dead.html/|title=Richard R. Ernst Nobelist Who Paved Way for MRI Dies at 87|last=Anthes|first=Emily|work=New York Times|date=16 June 2021|access-date=18 June 2021}}</ref> He was the oldest of three children of Irma Brunner and Robert Ernst. He grew up in a house built in 1898 by his grandfather, who was a merchant.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1991|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1991/ernst/biographical/|access-date=10 June 2021|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US}}</ref> During his childhood, he was interested in music, playing the [[Cello|violoncello]] and even considering a career as a musical composer. At 13-years old, Ernst stumbled upon a box of chemicals belonging to his late uncle, a metallurgical engineer.<ref>{{Citation|title=Insights from Notable Scientists|date=22 June 2011|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1201/b11013-11|work=Scientific Research as a Career|pages=95–114|publisher=CRC Press|doi=10.1201/b11013-11|isbn=978-0-429-10525-8|access-date=29 March 2021}}</ref> Young Ernst was excited by what he found, and set about trying all conceivable reactions, some of which resulted in explosions that terrified his parents.<ref name=":2" />

== Education ==
He enrolled in the [[ETH Zurich|Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule]] (ETH) in Zurich to study chemistry and received his diploma in 1957 as a “Diplomierter Ingenieur Chemiker<nowiki>''</nowiki>.<ref>https://ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/chab/chab-dept/department/images/Emeriti/richard_ernst/Autobiography2010.pdf</ref> He was disappointed in the course content, so conducted further research and taught himself quantum mechanics and thermodynamics in his spare time.<ref name=":2" /> After a break to complete his military service, Ernst earned his Ph.D. in [[physical chemistry]] in 1962<ref name=ernstphd>{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Richard R.|last=Ernst |title=Kernresonanz-Spektroskopie mit stochastischen Hochfrequenzfeldern |publisher=[[Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich]] |date=1962 |url=http://e-collection.library.ethz.ch/view/eth:33063 |doi=10.3929/ethz-a-000091764}}</ref> from ETH Zurich.<ref>[http://www.chab.ethz.ch/personen/emeritus/rernst Prof. Dr. Richard R.

== Career ==
Ernst entered [[Varian Associates]] as a scientist in 1963 and invented Fourier transform NMR, noise decoupling, and a number of other methods. He returned to ETH Zurich in 1968 and became a lecturer. His career developed to Assistant Professor in 1970, Associate Professor in 1972. Since 1976, Richard R. Ernst was Full Professor of Physical Chemistry.<ref name=":0" />

Ernst led a research group dedicated to magnetic resonance spectroscopy, was the director of the Physical Chemistry Laboratory at the ETH Zurich. He developed two-dimensional NMR and several novel pulse techniques. He retired in 1998. He participated in the development of medical magnetic resonance tomography, as well as the NMR structure determination of [[biopolymer]]s in solution collaborating with Professor [[Kurt Wüthrich]]. He also participated in the study of intra-molecular dynamics.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://chab.ethz.ch/en/the-department/people/emeriti/emeriti-homepages/richard-ernst.html|title=Prof. Dr. Richard R.

In 1991, Ernst was on an aeroplane flying over the Atlantic when he discovered he had been awarded The Nobel Prize in Chemistry. He was invited into the cockpit, where he was given a radio to talk to the Nobel committee. Here they told him he was being honoured "for his contributions to the development of the methodology of high resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy".<ref name=":2" /><ref>"The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1991".

Ernst was member of the World Knowledge Dialogue Scientific Board. He was awarded the [[Marcel Benoist Prize]] in 1986, the [[Wolf Prize]] for Chemistry in 1991,<ref name=Swissinfo>{{cite news|title=Richard Ernst, father of the MRI, dies aged 87|url=https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/richard-ernst--father-of-the-mri--dies-aged-87/46687642|date=8 June 2021|access-date=8 June 2021|publisher=Swissinfo}}</ref> and [[Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize]] of [[Columbia University]] in 1991.<ref name=":1" /><ref>[http://www.cumc.columbia.edu/horwitz/ The Official Site of Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize]</ref> He was also awarded the [[Tadeusz Reichstein|Tadeus Reichstein]] Medal in 2000<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.saphw.ch/en/awards/reichstein-medal|title=Reichstein Medal {{!}} Swiss Academy of Pharmaceutical Sciences SAPhS|website=www.saphw.ch|language=en|access-date=2 April 2017}}</ref> and the [[Order of the Star of Romania]] in 2004.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://legislatie.just.ro/Public/DetaliiDocument/49281 | title=DECRET 18 16/01/2004 - Portal Legislativ}}</ref>  He also held [[Honorary degree|Honorary Doctorates]] from the [[Technical University of Munich]], [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|EPF Lausanne]], [[University of Zurich]], [[University of Antwerp|University Antwerpen]], [[Babeș-Bolyai University|Babes-Bolyai University]], and [[University of Montpellier|University Montpellier]].<ref name=":1" />

The 2009 [[Bel Air Film Festival]] featured the [[world premiere]] of a [[documentary film]] on Ernst ''Science Plus Dharma Equals Social Responsibility''. Produced by [[Carlo Burton]], the film takes place in Ernst's hometown in Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vimooz.com/festivalticker/2009/10/2nd-annual-bel-air-film-festival-announces-line-up-and-honorees/|title=Film Festival Ticker|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111032333/http://www.vimooz.com/festivalticker/2009/10/2nd-annual-bel-air-film-festival-announces-line-up-and-honorees/|archive-date=11 November 2009}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Ernst was married to Magdalena until his death.<ref name=AFP>{{cite news|title=Nobel-winning MRI pioneer Richard Ernst dies|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/nobel-winning-mri-pioneer-richard-ernst-dies|date=8 June 2021|access-date=8 June 2021|newspaper=The Straits Times|location=Singapore|agency=Agence France-Presse}}</ref>  Together, they had three children: Anna Magdalena, Katharina Elisabeth and Hans-Martin Walter.<ref name=Nobel/>
Besides toiling with his work, Ernst also enjoyed music and art, specifically Tibetan scroll art. Using scientific techniques, Ernst would research the pigments on the scrolls to learn about their geographic origin and age.<ref name="Anthes"/>
