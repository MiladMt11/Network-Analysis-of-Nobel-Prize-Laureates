'''Alexander Mikhailovich Prokhorov'''<ref name=nobel/> (born '''Alexander Michael Prochoroff''', {{lang-ru|Алекса&#769;ндр Миха&#769;йлович Про&#769;хоров}}; 11 July 1916&nbsp;– 8 January 2002) was an Australian-born Soviet-Russian [[physicist]] known for his pioneering research on [[laser]]s and [[maser]]s in the [[Soviet Union]] for which he shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1964 with [[Charles Hard Townes]] and [[Nikolay Basov]].

==Early life==
Alexander Michael Prochoroff was born on 11 July 1916 at Russell Road [[Peeramon, Queensland|Peeramon]], [[Queensland]], Australia (now 322 Gadaloff Road, [[Butchers Creek, Queensland|Butchers Creek]], situated about 30km from [[Atherton, Queensland|Atherton]]), to Mikhail Ivanovich Prokhorov and Maria Ivanovna (née Mikhailova), [[Russia]]n revolutionaries who had emigrated from Russia to escape repression by the [[tsar]]ist regime. As a child he attended Butchers Creek School.<ref name=birth>Tablelander (newspaper) 19 July 2016 'Prokharov centenary'</ref> In 1923, after the [[October Revolution]] and the [[Russian Civil War]], the family returned to Russia. In 1934, Prokhorov entered the [[Saint Petersburg State University]] to study physics. He was a member of the [[Komsomol]] from 1930 to 1944. Prokhorov graduated with honors in 1939 and moved to Moscow to work at the [[Lebedev Physical Institute]], in the oscillations laboratory headed by [[academician]] N. D. Papaleksi. His research there was devoted to propagation of radio waves in the [[ionosphere]]. At the onset of [[World War II]] in the Soviet Union, in June 1941, he joined the Red Army. During World War II, Prokhorov fought in the infantry, was wounded twice in battles, and was awarded three medals, including the [[Medal "For Courage" (Russia)|Medal For Courage]] in 1946.<ref name=family/> He was demobilized in 1944 and returned to the Lebedev Institute where, in 1946, he defended his Ph.D. [[thesis]] on "Theory of Stabilization of Frequency of a Tube Oscillator in the Theory of a Small Parameter".<ref name=nobel>{{Nobelprize}} including the Nobel Lecture, 11 December 1964 ''Quantum Electronics''</ref><ref name=bse>[http://bse.sci-lib.com/article093736.html Прохоров Александр Михайлович] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005091809/http://bse.sci-lib.com/article093736.html |date=5 October 2015 }} in [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]] {{in lang|ru}}</ref><ref name=hero/>

==Research==
In 1947, Prokhorov started working on coherent radiation emitted by electrons orbiting in a cyclic [[particle accelerator]] called a [[synchrotron]]. He demonstrated that the emission is mostly concentrated in the [[microwave]] spectral range. His results became the basis of his [[habilitation]] on "Coherent Radiation of Electrons in the Synchrotron Accelerator", defended in 1951. By 1950, Prokhorov was assistant chief of the oscillation laboratory. Around that time, he formed a group of young scientists to work on radiospectroscopy of molecular rotations and vibrations, and later on [[quantum electronics]]. The group focused on a special class of molecules which have three (non-degenerate) moments of inertia. The research was conducted both on experiment and theory. In 1954, Prokhorov became head of the laboratory. Together with [[Nikolay Basov]] he developed theoretical grounds for creation of a molecular oscillator and constructed such an oscillator based on ammonia. They also proposed a method for the production of population inversion using inhomogeneous electric and magnetic fields. Their results were first presented at a national conference in 1952, but not published until 1954–1955;<ref name=nobel/><ref name=hero/>

In 1955, Prokhorov started his research in the field of [[electron paramagnetic resonance]] (EPR). He focused on relaxation times of ions of the [[iron group element]]s in a lattice of [[aluminium oxide]], but also investigated other, "non-optical", topics, such as magnetic phase transitions in [[DPPH]].<ref>A. M. Prokhorov and V.B. Fedorov, Soviet Physics JETP 16 (1963) 1489.</ref> In 1957, while studying [[ruby]], a [[chromium]]-doped variation of aluminium oxide, he came upon the idea of using this material as an active medium of a laser. As a new type of laser resonator, he proposed, in 1958, an "open type" cavity design, which is widely used today. In 1963, together with A. S. Selivanenko, he suggested a laser using two-quantum transitions. For his pioneering work on lasers and masers, in 1964, he received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] shared with [[Nikolay Basov]] and [[Charles Hard Townes]].<ref name=nobel/><ref name=hero/>

In 1959, Prokhorov became a professor at [[Moscow State University]] – the most prestigious university in the Soviet Union; the same year, he was awarded the [[Lenin Prize]]. In 1960, he became a member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] and elected Academician in 1966. In 1967, he was awarded his first [[Order of Lenin]] (he received five of them during life, in 1967, 1969, 1975, 1981 and 1986). In 1968, he became vice-director of the Lebedev Institute and in 1971 took the position of Head of Laboratory of another prestigious Soviet institution, the [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]]. In the same year, he was elected a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref name=bse/> In 1983 he was elected a Member of the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leopoldina.org/en/members/list-of-members/member/4512/|title=List of Members|website=www.leopoldina.org|access-date=4 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004034903/http://www.leopoldina.org/en/members/list-of-members/member/4512/|archive-date=4 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Between 1982 and 1998, Prokhorov served as acting director of the General Physics Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, and after 1998 as honorary director.
