'''Max Ludwig Henning Delbrück''' ({{IPA-de|maks ˈdɛl.bʁʏk|lang|De-Max Delbrück.ogg}}; September 4, 1906 – March 9, 1981) was a [[German–American]] [[biophysicist]] who participated in launching the [[molecular biology]] [[research program]] in the late 1930s.  He stimulated [[physical science|physical scientists]]' interest into [[biology]], especially as to [[basic research]] to physically explain [[genes]], mysterious at the time.  Formed in 1945 and led by Delbrück along with [[Salvador Luria]] and [[Alfred Hershey]], the [[Phage Group]] made substantial headway unraveling important aspects of [[genetics]]. The three shared the 1969 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] "for their discoveries concerning the replication mechanism and the genetic structure of viruses".<ref name=Nobel>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1969 "The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1969"], Nobel Media AB 2013, ''Nobelprize.org'', Web acces November 6, 2013.</ref> He was the first physicist to predict what is now called [[Delbrück scattering]].<ref>{{cite journal

==Early and personal life==
[[File:Max Delbruck.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Delbrück in the early 1940s]]
Delbrück was born in [[Berlin]], [[German Empire]]. His mother was granddaughter of [[Justus von Liebig]], an eminent [[chemist]], while his father [[Hans Delbrück]] was a [[history]] professor at the [[University of Berlin]]. In 1937, Delbrück left Nazi Germany for America—first California, then Tennessee—becoming a [[Citizenship in the United States|US citizen]] in 1945.<ref name=brittanica-x1/> In 1941, he married Mary Bruce. They had four children.

Delbrück's brother Justus, a lawyer, as well as his sister [[Emmi Bonhoeffer]] were active along with his brothers-in-law [[Klaus Bonhoeffer]] and [[Dietrich Bonhoeffer]] in [[German Resistance to Nazism|resistance to Nazism]]. Found guilty by the [[People's Court (Germany)|People's Court]] for roles in the [[20 July plot|July 20, 1944 plot to assassinate Hitler]], Dietrich and Klaus were executed in 1945 by the [[SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt|RSHA]]. Justus died in Soviet custody that same year.

==Education==
Delbrück studied [[astrophysics]], shifting towards [[theoretical physics]], at the [[University of Göttingen]]. After completing his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] there in 1930,<ref>"[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Max-Delbruck Max Delbrück]". ''Encyclopaedia Britannica''. britannica.com. Retrieved January 27, 2019.</ref> he traveled through [[England]], [[Denmark]], and [[Switzerland]]. He met [[Wolfgang Pauli]] and [[Niels Bohr]], who interested him in [[biology]].

==Career and research==
[[File:Freie Universitaet Berlin Otto-Hahn-Bau im Winter 01-2005.jpg|thumb|Delbrück's workplace in Berlin: Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry, now the [[Free University of Berlin]].]]

Delbrück returned to Berlin in 1932 as an assistant to [[Lise Meitner]], who was collaborating with [[Otto Hahn]] on irradiation of [[uranium]] with [[neutrons]].  Delbrück wrote a few papers, including one in 1933 on [[gamma rays]]' scattering by a [[Coulomb]] field's polarization of a vacuum.  Though theoretically tenable, his conclusion was misplaced, whereas [[Hans Bethe]] some 20 years later confirmed the phenomenon and named it "[[Delbrück scattering]]".<ref name=NAS>{{cite journal|pmid=11639973|url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=2201&page=67|year=1992|author1=W. Hayes|title=Max Ludwig Henning Delbrück – September 4, 1906 – March 10, 1981|journal=Biographical Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=62|pages=67–117}}</ref>

In 1935, Delbrück published a collaboration with [[Nikolay Timofeev-Ressovsky]] and [[Karl Zimmer]] the major work, ''Über die Natur der Genmutation und der Genstruktur''. It was considered to be a major advance in understanding the nature of gene mutation and gene structure.<ref>Timofeeff-Ressovky, N. W.,  K. G. Zimmer, and M. Delbrück "Über die Natur der Genmutation und der Genstruktur" ([[Weidmannsche Buchhandlung]], 1935).

It was also an inspirational starting point for [[Erwin Schrödinger| Erwin Schrödinger's]] thinking, a course of lectures in 1943,  and the eventual writing of the book ''What Is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell''.<ref>Erwin Schrödinger ''What Is Life? The Physical Aspect of the Living Cell'' (Cambridge University Press, 1944).</ref>

In 1937, he attained a fellowship from [[Rockefeller Foundation]]—which was launching the [[molecular biology]] [[research program]]—to research [[genetics]] of the fruit fly, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', in [[California Institute of Technology]]'s biology department,<ref name=MDC>[https://archive.today/20120804081324/http://www.mdc-berlin.de/en/news/archive/2006/20060904-mdc_celebrates_centennial_of_max_delbr_ck/index.html "MDC celebrates centennial of Max Delbrück"].

In 1939, with [[Emory Ellis|Emory L. Ellis]]<ref>Ellis E. L., Delbrück M. The growth of bacteriophage. J Gen Physiol. 1939 Jan 20;22(3):365-84. PMID 19873108</ref><ref>Ellis E.L.

Although Delbrück's [[Rockefeller Foundation]] fellowship expired in 1939, the Foundation matched him up with [[Vanderbilt University]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where from 1940 to 1947 he taught [[physics]], yet had his laboratory in the biology department.<ref name=Vanderbilt>[http://www.vanderbilt.edu/delbruck "Max Delbrück at Vanderbilt, 1940–1947"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011134613/http://www.vanderbilt.edu/delbruck/ |date=October 11, 2012 }}, Vanderbilt University, Web access November 6, 2013.</ref>  In 1941, Delbrück met [[Salvador Luria]] of [[Indiana University]] who began visiting Vanderbilt.<ref name=Vanderbilt/>  In 1942, [[Luria–Delbrück experiment|Delbrück and Luria published]] on [[bacteria]]l resistance to [[virus]] infection mediated by random [[mutation]].<ref name=Vanderbilt/>  [[Alfred Hershey]] of [[Washington University]] began visiting in 1943.<ref name=Vanderbilt/> The Luria–Delbrück experiment, also called the Fluctuation Test, demonstrated that Darwin's theory of natural selection acting on random mutations applies to bacteria as well as to more complex organisms. The 1969 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded to both scientists in part for this work. To put this work in its historical perspective, Lamarck in 1801 first presented his theory of Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics, which stated that if an organism changes during life in order to adapt to its environment (for example stretches its neck to reach for tall trees), those changes are passed on to its offspring. He also said that evolution happens according to a predetermined plan. Darwin published his theory of evolution in his 1859 book On the Origin of Species with compelling evidence contradicting Lamarck. Darwin said that evolution is not predetermined but that there are inherent variations in all organisms, and that those variations that confer increased fitness are selected by the environment and passed on to the offspring. In the feud between Lamarck and Darwin, Darwin talked of pre-existing changes, but the nature of these changes was not known and had to await the science of genetics by Gregor Mendel's experiments on pea plants published in 1866. Support for Darwin's theory was provided when Thomas Hunt Morgan discovered that a mutated white-eyed fruit fly among red-eyed flies was able to reproduce true white-eyed offspring. The most elegant and convincing support for Darwin's ideas, however, was provided by the Luria-Delbruck experiment<ref>Luria SE, Delbrück M. Mutations of bacteria from virus sensitivity to virus resistance. Genetics. 1943 Nov;28(6):491-511. doi: 10.1093/genetics/28.6.491.

Stent, and James D. Watson, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory of Quantitative Biology, Cold Spring Harbor, Long Island, New York, pgs. 173-179. ISBN 978-0879698003</ref><ref>Luria SE. A Slot Machine, a Broken Test Tube.  An Autobiography. Harper and Row, New York, 1984. Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Series</ref>, which showed that mutations conferring resistance of the bacterium E. coli to T1 bacteriophage (virus) existed in the population prior to exposure to T1 and were not induced by adding T1. In other words, mutations are random events that occur whether or not they prove to be useful, while selection (for T1 resistance upon challenge with T1 in this case) provides the direction in evolution by retaining those mutations that are advantageous, discarding those that are harmful (T1 sensitivity in this case). This experiment dealt a blow to Lamarckian inheritance and set the stage for tremendous advances in genetics and molecular biology, launching a tsunami of research that eventually led to the discovery of DNA as the hereditary material and to cracking the genetic code.  Of course, by then Avery, along with McCloud (and earlier, McCarty) was well on the way to showing the genetic capability of DNA.

In 1945, Delbrück, Luria, and Hershey set up a course in [[bacteriophage]] genetics at [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]] in [[Long Island, New York]].<ref name=Vanderbilt/>  This [[Phage Group]] spurred [[molecular biology]]'s early development.<ref>J.D. Watson (2012).

He analyzed and defined the conditions for precise measurement of the biological effects. Together with Luria he elaborated the quantitative methods and established the statistical criteria for evaluation which made the subsequent penetrating studies possible. Delbrück's and Luria's forte is perhaps mainly theoretical analysis, whereas Hershey above all is an eminently skillful experimenter. The three of them supplement each other well also in these respects." That year, Delbrück and [[Salvador Luria|Luria]] were also awarded by [[Columbia University]] the [[Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize]].  In late 1947, as Vanderbilt lacked the resources to keep him, Delbrück had returned to Caltech as a professor of biology, and remained there for the rest of his career.<ref name=Vanderbilt/>  Meanwhile, he set up [[University of Cologne]]'s institute for [[molecular genetics]].

==Awards and honours==
In addition to the Nobel Prize, Delbrück was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1967|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1967]].<ref name="frs"/> He was elected an [[EMBO Member]] in 1970.<ref name=membo/> The [[Max Delbruck Prize]], formerly known as the biological physics prize, is awarded by the [[American Physical Society]] and named in his honour. The [[Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association|Max Delbrück Center]], in Berlin, Germany, national research center for molecular medicine of the [[Helmholtz Association]] also bears his name.

==Later life and legacy==
Delbrück helped spur [[physical science|physical scientist]]s' interest in biology.  His inferences on genes' susceptibility to mutation was relied on by physicist [[Erwin Schrödinger]] in his 1944 book ''[[What is Life? (Schrödinger)|What Is Life?]]'',<ref>{{cite journal | author= K. R.

He became interested in the behavioral sciences and spent some unfruitful effort on mold behavior in the 1960s.

Max Delbrück died, at age 74, on the evening of Monday, March 9, 1981, at [[Huntington Memorial Hospital]] in [[Pasadena, California]].  On August 26 to 27, 2006—the year Delbrück would have turned 100—family and friends gathered at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory to reminisce on his life and work.<ref>Kiryn Haslinger.
