'''Allan MacLeod Cormack''' (February 23, 1924 – May 7, 1998) was a [[South African American]] [[physicist]] who won the 1979 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] (along with [[Godfrey Hounsfield]]) for his work on [[X-ray]] [[computed tomography]] (CT).<ref>{{cite web|title=1979: Allan MacLeod Cormack (1924-1998)|url=https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/1979-allan-macleod-cormack-1924-1998|work=[[St John's College, Cambridge]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Oransky|first=Ivan|date=September 2004|title=Sir Godfrey N Hounsfield|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140673604170499|journal=The Lancet|language=en|volume=364|issue=9439|pages=1032|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(04)17049-9|pmid=15455486}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Cormack was born in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa. He attended [[Rondebosch Boys' High School]] in [[Cape Town]], where he was active in the debating and tennis teams.<ref>{{Nobelprize|name=Allan M. Cormack|accessdate=2020-10-11}}</ref> He received his B.Sc. in [[physics]] in 1944 from the [[University of Cape Town]] and his M.Sc. in [[crystallography]] in 1945 from the same institution. He was a doctoral student at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] from 1947–49, and while at Cambridge he met his future wife, Barbara Seavey, an American physics student.

==Career==
After marrying Barbara , he returned to the University of Cape Town in early 1950 to lecture. Following a sabbatical at [[Harvard]] in 1956-57, the couple agreed to move to the United States, and Cormack became a professor at [[Tufts University]] in the fall of 1957. Cormack became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States in 1966. Although he was mainly working on [[particle physics]], Cormack's side interest in x-ray technology led him to develop the theoretical underpinnings of CT scanning. This work was initiated at the University of Cape Town and [[Groote Schuur Hospital]] in early 1956 and continued briefly in mid-1957 after returning from his sabbatical. His results were subsequently published in two papers in the Journal of Applied Physics in 1963 and 1964. These papers generated little interest until [[Godfrey Hounsfield|Hounsfield]] and colleagues built the first CT scanner in 1971, taking Cormack's theoretical calculations into a real application.  For their independent efforts, Cormack and Hounsfield shared the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. It is notable that the two built a very similar type of device without collaboration in different parts of the world [3]. He was member of the [[International Academy of Science, Munich]]. In 1990, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/nms/recip_details.cfm?recip_id=89|title=The President's National Medal of Science: Recipient Details {{!}} NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-11-14}}</ref>

==Death==
Cormack died of cancer in Winchester, Massachusetts at age 74. He was posthumously awarded the [[Order of Mapungubwe]] on the 10 December 2002 for outstanding achievements as a scientist and for co-inventing the CT scanner.
