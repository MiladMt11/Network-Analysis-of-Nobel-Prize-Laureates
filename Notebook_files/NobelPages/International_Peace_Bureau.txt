Its membership consists of 300 organizations in 70 countries.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=IPB - Who we are {{!}} IPB - International Peace Bureau|url=http://www.ipb.org/who-we-are/|access-date=2020-06-22|language=en-US}}</ref> IPB's headquarters is located in [[Berlin|Berlin, Germany]] with offices in [[Barcelona, Spain]], and [[Geneva, Switzerland]]. Prior to 2017, the headquarters was based in Geneva. 

Its main programmes are the '''Global Campaign on Military Spending (GCOMS)''' and ''disarmament for sustainable development'', which focuses both on nuclear and conventional weapons, as well as biological weapons, landmines, and small arms.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Homepage -|url=http://demilitarize.org/|access-date=2020-06-22|website=demilitarize.org|language=en-US}}</ref>

IPB holds Consultative Status with the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC) and associate status with the [[United Nations Department of Global Communications]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=IPB - Who we are {{!}} IPB - International Peace Bureau|url=http://www.ipb.org/who-we-are/|access-date=2020-06-22|language=en-US}}</ref>

IPB was founded under the name '''Permanent International Peace Bureau''' (''Bureau International Permanent de la Paix''). From 1912 onward it used the name '''International Peace Bureau'''. Between 1946 and 1961, it was known under the name '''International Liaison Committee of Organizations for Peace – ILCOP''' (''Comité de liaison international des organisations de paix – CLIOP'').

== Global Campaign on Military Spending ==
The Global Campaign on Military Spending (GCOMS) is a permanent, global, year-round campaign that was created in December 2014 by the IPB to tackle the worldwide issue of excessive military spending.<ref>{{cite web|title=Who We Are|url=http://demilitarize.org/who-we-are/|access-date=November 6, 2018|website=Global Campaign on Military Spendin|publisher=International Peace Bureau}}</ref>

The aim of the campaign is to pressure the world's governments to invest money in the sectors of health, education, employment and climate change rather than military. It also calls for an annual, minimum reallocation of 10% from the military budgets of all states. Finally, it advocates the reduction of arms production and international weapons trade.<ref>{{cite web|title=What We Do|url=http://demilitarize.org/what-we-do/|access-date=November 6, 2018|website=Global Campaign on Military Spendin|publisher=International Peace Bureau}}</ref>

[[File:GDAMS Actions in Halifax, Canada.jpg|thumb|GDAMS Actions in Halifax, Canada]]

The campaign organises the Global Day of Action on Military Spending (GDAMS) to bring public, media and political attention to the costs of military spending and the need to invest in new priorities.<ref>{{cite web|title=GCOMS (Global Campaign on Military Spending)|url=http://www.centredelas.org/en/14-campanyes/3325-gcoms-global-campaign-on-military-spending|access-date=November 6, 2018|website=Centre Delàs|publisher=Centre Delàs}}</ref>

GCOMS is managed from the decentralized [[Barcelona|Barcelona, Spain]] office of IPB in coordination with Centre Delàs of Peace Studies. More than 100 organizations from 35 countries have joined the campaign.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Who we are -|url=http://demilitarize.org/global-campaign-on-military-spending/who-we-are/|access-date=2020-06-22|website=demilitarize.org|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Nuclear Disarmament Activism ==
IPB has been in the forefront of nuclear disarmament activities since 1945, including:

* [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]] (NPT)
* [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]] (CTBT)
* World Court Project
* [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]] (TPNW)

Currently, the IPB is campaigning to encourage the signing and ratification of the TPNW so that it may enter into force.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Nuclear Weapons {{!}} IPB - International Peace Bureau|url=http://www.ipb.org/nuclear-weapons/|access-date=2020-06-22|language=en-US}}</ref>
