==Early life==
Ružička was born in [[Vukovar]], [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]], [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen]], [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] (today in [[Croatia]]). His family of craftsmen and farmers was mostly of [[Croats|Croat]] origin, with a [[Czechs|Czech]] great grandparent, [[Ružička]], and a great grandmother and a great grandfather from [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]].<ref name = Nobel>{{cite book|editor-first = Karl|editor-last = Grandin|chapter = Leopold Ružička|title = Nobel Lectures, Chemistry: 1922-1941|publisher = [[Elsevier Publishing Company]]|location = Amsterdam|year = 1966}}<br />Now available from {{cite web|url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1939/ruzicka-bio.html|title = Leopold Ružička Biography|website = [[nobelprize.org]]|publisher = [[Nobel Foundation]]|year = 1939|access-date = 6 July 2017}}</ref> He lost his father, Stjepan, at the age of four, and his mother, Amalija Sever, took him and his younger brother Stjepan, to live in [[Osijek]].<ref name=frs/>

Ružička attended the classics-program secondary school in Osijek. He changed his original [[idea]] of becoming a priest and switched to studying technical disciplines.<ref name=em90/> [[Chemistry]] was his choice, probably because he hoped to get a position at the newly opened [[sugar refinery]] built in Osijek.<ref name=frs/>

Owing to the excessive hardship of everyday and political life, he left and chose the High Technical School in [[Karlsruhe]] in [[Germany]]. He was a good [[student]] in areas he liked and that he thought would be necessary and beneficial in future, which was [[organic chemistry]]. That is why his [[physical chemistry]] professor, [[Fritz Haber]] ([[Nobel laureate]] in 1918), opposed his ''[[summa cum laude]]'' [[academic degree|degree]]. However, in the course of his studies, Ružička set up excellent cooperation with [[Hermann Staudinger]] (a [[Nobel laureate]] in 1953). Studying within Staudinger's department, he obtained his doctoral degree in 1910, then moving to [[Zurich]] as Staudinger's assistant.

==Career in research==
Ružička's first works originated in the field of chemistry of natural compounds.<ref name=cid>{{Cite web|url=http://chemindigest.com/leopold-ruzicka-1887-1976/|title = Leopold Ruzicka (1887–1976)|date = 26 October 2018}}</ref> He remained in this field of research all his life. He investigated the ingredients of the [[Dalmatia]]n [[insect]] powder [[Pyrethrum]] (from the herb ''[[Tanacetum cinerariifolium]]''), a highly esteemed [[insecticide]] found in [[pyrethrin]]s, which were the focus of his work with Staudinger. Ruzicka later said of this time: "Toward the end of five and a half years of mainly synthetic work on the pyrethrins I had come to the firm conclusion that we were barking up the wrong tree." In this way, he came into contact with the chemistry of [[Terpineol]], a [[fragrant]] oil of vegetable origin, interesting to the [[perfume]] [[Industry (economics)|industry]]. He and Staudinger split company when he started cooperation with the Chuit & Naef Company (later known as [[Firmenich]]) in [[Geneva]].<ref name=em90>Albert Eschenmoser: "Leopold Ruzicka - From the Isoprene Rule to the Question of Life's Origin" CHIMIA 44 (1990)</ref><ref name=frs/>

In 1916–1917, he received the support of the oldest perfume [[manufacturer]] in the [[world]] ''[[Symrise#Haarman & Reimer|Haarman & Reimer]]'', of [[Holzminden]], Germany. He became a Swiss citizen in 1917,<ref name=frs/> and published his [[Habilitation]] in 1918.<ref name=em90/> Fornasir and he isolated [[linalool]] in 1919.<ref name=em90/>

With expertise in the terpene field, he became senior lecturer in 1918, and in 1923, honorary professor at the [[ETH Zurich|ETH]] (Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule) as well the [[University of Zurich|University]] in Zurich. Here, with a group of his doctoral students, he proved the structure of the compounds [[muscone]] and [[civetone]], [[macrocycle|macrocyclic]] ketone scents derived from the [[musk deer]] (''Moschus moschiferus'') and the [[civet]] cat (''Viverra civetta'').<ref name=sell99>{{cite book|title = The Chemistry of Fragrances|editor1-last = Pybus|editor1-first = David H.|editor2-first = Charles S.|editor2-last = Sell|pages = 51–124|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=u_b7-qY2xT8C&pg=PA91|publisher = [[Royal Society of Chemistry|Royal Society of Chemistry Publishing]]|year = 1999|isbn = 9780854045280|edition = 1st|chapter = Ingredients for the Modern Perfumery Industry|first = Charles S.|last = Sell}}</ref>  These were the first [[natural product]]s shown to have rings with more than six atoms, and at the time that Ružička inferred that civetone as having a 17-member ring.<ref>{{cite journal|first = Leopold|last = Ružička|title = Zur Kenntnis des Kohlenstoffringes I.

In 1921, the Geneva perfume manufacturers [[Chuit & Naef]] asked him to collaborate.<ref name=frs/> Working here, Ružička achieved financial independence, but not as big as he had planned, so he left Zurich to start working for the [[Basel]]-based [[Ciba Specialty Chemicals|CIBA]].{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} In 1927, he took over the organic chemistry chair at [[Utrecht University]] in [[Netherlands]]. In Netherlands he remained for three years, and then returned to [[Switzerland]], which was superior in its chemical industry. A synergistic upheaval in both the administration and chemistry departments coincided to make his good fortune.<ref name=frs/>

Ruzicka was first to synthesize [[musk]] at an industrial scale. Firmenech named this product [[Exaltone]]. Other Swiss manufacturers and [[DuPont]] were in competition with them.<ref name="gs15">{{cite journal |last1=Shyndriayeva |first1=Galina |title=Perfume at the Forefront of Macrocyclic Compound Research: From Switzerland to Du Pont |journal=International Workshop on the History of Chemistry |date=2015 |location=Tokyo |url=http://kagakushi.org/iwhc2015/papers/23.ShyndriayevaGalina.pdf}}</ref>

In 1934, Ruzicka synthesized the male hormone [[androsterone]] and also proved "its constitutional and configurational relation to the [[sterols]]." This was followed in 1935 by the partial synthesis of the much more active male hormone [[testosterone]]. Both discoveries led to the pre-eminence of the Swiss industry in the steroid hormone field.<ref name=frs/> At Zurich, at ''ETH'' he became [[professor]] of organic chemistry and started the most brilliant period of his professional career. He widened the area of his [[research]], adding to it the chemistry of higher terpenes and [[steroids]]. After the successful synthesis in 1935 of sex [[hormones]] ([[androsterone]] and [[testosterone]]),<ref name=nytobit/> his [[laboratory]] became the world center of organic chemistry.<ref name="nieschlag19">{{cite journal |doi=10.1530/EJE-19-0071|title=ENDOCRINE HISTORY: The history of discovery, synthesis and development of testosterone for clinical use|year=2019|last1=Nieschlag|first1=Eberhard|last2=Nieschlag|first2=Susan|journal=European Journal of Endocrinology|volume=180|issue=6|pages=R201–R212|pmid=30959485|doi-access=free}}</ref> He was awarded in 1936 an honorary degree from [[Harvard University]].<ref name=nytobit/>

In 1939 he won the [[Nobel prize]] for chemistry with [[Adolf Butenandt]].<ref name = Nobel /> Over the period 1934-1939 he had published 70 papers in the field of medicinally important steroid sex hormones, and filed several dozen patents besides.<ref name=frs/>

In 1940, following the award, he was invited by the [[Croatian Chemical Association]], where he delivered a lecture to an over packed hall of dignitaries. The topic of the lecture was ''From the Dalmatian Insect Powder to Sex Hormones''. In 1940 he became a foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]],<ref name = KNAW-Members>{{cite web|url = http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00002731|title = Leopold Stephan Ruzicka (1887 - 1976)|website = KNAW Past Members|publisher = [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]]|access-date = 4 August 2015|archive-date = 23 September 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150923232350/http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00002731|url-status = live}}</ref> in 1942 he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Society]],<ref name=frs/> and in 1944 he became an international member of the US [[National Academy of Sciences]].<ref name=nas>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/deceased-members/20001250.html|title=Leopold Ruzicka}}</ref> During the [[World War II]], some of his excellent collaborators were lost, but Ružička restructured his laboratory with new, younger and promising people; among them was young scientist and future Nobel Laureate [[Vladimir Prelog]]. With new people and ideas new research areas were opened.

In 1946, Ruzicka and Lardon "established that the fragrance of [[ambergris]] is based on the [[triterpene]] (named) [[ambrein]]".<ref name=ruzicka46>{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/hlca.19460290414|title=Zur Kenntnis der Triterpene.

Following 1950, Ružička returned to chemistry, which had entered a new era of research. Now he turned to the field of [[biochemistry]], the problems of [[evolution]] and genesis of life, particularly to the [[biogenesis]] of terpenes. In 1953, he published his hypothesis, the ''Biogenetic Isoprene Rule'' (that the carbon skeleton of terpenes is composed variously of regularly or irregularly linked [[isoprene]] units), which was the peak of his scientific career.<ref name=ruzicka53>{{cite journal |title = The isoprene rule and the biogenesis of terpenic compounds |first = Leopold |last = Ružička|journal = [[Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences]]|volume = 9|issue = 10|pages = 357–367 |year = 1953 |doi = 10.1007/BF02167631 |pmid = 13116962 |s2cid = 44195550 }}</ref> In 1952, [[Oskar Jeger]] and he supervised a team which isolated [[lanosterol]] and established the link between terpenes and steroids.<ref name=voser52>Voser, W., M.

==Later life, legacy, honours and awards==
Ruzicka was the recipient of eight honorary doctorates and the 1938 [[Marcel Benoist Prize]].<ref name=frs/> He was listed as author on 583 scientific papers.<ref name=frs/> In 1965, he became an honorary member of the [[Polish Chemical Society]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://ptchem.pl/pl/honors/president-of-honor-and-honorary-members-of-ptchem |title=President of honour and honorary members of PTChem |access-date=23 February 2020}}</ref> and he was an honorary member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref name=nytobit/> After the war he acquired a taste for Dutch masterpieces, which he later lodged in the [[Kunsthaus Zürich]] as the Ruzicka collection.<ref name=frs/> He militated against [[nuclear weapons]].<ref name=ethzarc/>

In 1970, Ruzicka delivered to the [[Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings|Nobel Laureate Conferences]] in [[Lindau]] a lecture entitled "Nobel Prizes and the chemistry of life".<ref name=frs/>

In later years, he served as consultant to [[Sandoz A. G.]] of Basel.<ref name=frs/>

Ružička dedicated significant efforts to the problems of [[education]]. He insisted on a better organization of academic education and scientific work in the new [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and established the [[Swiss-Yugoslav Society]]. Ružička became an honorary [[academician]] at the then [[Yugoslav Academy of Sciences and Arts]] in [[Zagreb]].

In 1974 he was awarded the [[Order of the Yugoslav Flag]] with Golden Wreath.<ref name=frs/>

At [[ETH Zurich]], the [[Ruzicka Award|Ružička Award]] was established in 1957 on the occasion of his retirement, for young chemists working in Switzerland.<ref name=em90/>

In his native [[Vukovar]], a museum was opened in his honour in 1977.<ref name=frs/>

Ruzicka's archives are kept at ETH Zurich.<ref name=ethzarc>{{Cite web|url=https://library.ethz.ch/en/locations-and-media/platforms/short-portraits/ruzicka-leopold-1887-1976.html|title = Leopold Ruzicka (1887–1976)}}</ref>

===Personal life===
Ružička married twice: to Anna Hausmann in 1912, and 1951 to Gertrud Acklin.<ref name = Nobel /> From 1929, he lived at Freudenbergstrasse 101 until the last years of his life.<ref name=frs/> He died in [[Mammern]], [[Switzerland]], a village on [[Lake Constance]] at the age of 89.<ref name="nytobit">{{cite news |title=Dr. Leopold Ruzicka Dies M Switzerland at Age 89; Won Nobel in Chemistry |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/09/27/archives/dr-leopold-ruzicka-dies-in-switzerland-at-age-89-won-nobel-in.html |work=New York Times |date=27 September 1976}}</ref>
