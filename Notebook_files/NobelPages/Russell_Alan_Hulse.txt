'''Russell Alan Hulse''' (born November 28, 1950) is an American [[physicist]] and winner of the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], shared with his thesis advisor [[Joseph Hooton Taylor Jr.]], "''for the discovery of a new type of pulsar, a discovery that has opened up new possibilities for the study of gravitation''".

==Biography==
Hulse was born in [[New York City]] and graduated from the [[Bronx High School of Science]] and the [[Cooper Union]]. He received his [[Ph.D.]] in [[physics]] from the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] in 1975.

While working on his Ph.D. dissertation, he was a scholar in 1974 at the [[Arecibo Observatory]] in [[Puerto Rico]] of [[Cornell University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/992/000099695/ |title=Russell A. Hulse's Bio retrieved from Notable Names Database As of April 26, 2015}}</ref> There he worked with Taylor on a large-scale survey for pulsars.  It was this work that led to the discovery of the first [[binary pulsar]].

In 1974, Hulse and Taylor discovered [[PSR B1913+16|binary pulsar PSR B1913]], which is made up of a pulsar and black companion [[star]]. [[Neutron star]] rotation emits impulses that are extremely regular and stable in the [[radio wave]] region and is nearby condensed  material body gravitation (non-detectable in the visible field). Hulse, Taylor, and other colleagues have used this first [[binary star|binary]] [[pulsar]] to make high-precision tests of [[general relativity]], demonstrating the existence of [[gravitational radiation]]. An [[approximation]] of this [[radiant energy]] is described by the formula of the quadrupolar radiation of [[Albert Einstein]] (1918).

In 1979, researchers announced measurements of small acceleration effects of the orbital movements of a pulsar. This was initial proof that the system of these two moving masses emits gravitational waves.

==Later years==

After receiving his Ph.D., Hulse did postdoctoral work at the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]] in [[Green Bank, West Virginia]]. He moved to Princeton, where he has worked for many years at the [[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]]. He has also worked on science education, and in 2003 joined the [[University of Texas at Dallas]] as a [[professor|visiting professor]] of [[physics]] and of [[mathematics]] and [[science]] [[education]].

In 1993, Hulse and Taylor shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for the discovery of the first binary pulsar.

Hulse was elected a [[Fellow of the AAAS|Fellow]] of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in 2003, and is cited in the [[American Men and Women of Science]].

In 2004, Hulse joined [[University of Texas at Dallas]] and became the Founding Director of UT Dallas Science and Engineering Education Center (SEEC).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.utdallas.edu/chairs/profiles/hulse.html|title=Russell A.

In July 2007 Hulse joined the [[Aurora Imaging Technology]] advisory board.
