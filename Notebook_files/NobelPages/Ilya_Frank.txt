'''Ilya Mikhailovich Frank''' ({{lang-ru|Илья́ Миха́йлович Франк}}; 23 October 1908 – 22 June 1990) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] winner of the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1958 jointly with [[Pavel Alekseyevich Cherenkov]] and [[Igor Tamm|Igor Y. Tamm]], also of the Soviet Union. He received the award for his work in explaining the phenomenon of [[Cherenkov effect|Cherenkov radiation]]. He received the Stalin prize in 1946 and 1953 and the USSR state prize in 1971.

==Life and career==
Ilya Frank was born on 23 October 1908 in [[St. Petersburg]]. His father, [[:ru:Франк, Михаил Людвигович|Mikhail Lyudvigovich Frank]], was a talented mathematician descended from a [[Jewish]] family, while his mother Yelizaveta Mikhailovna Gratsianova, was a [[Russian Orthodox]] [[physician]]. His father participated in the student revolutionary movement, and as a result was expelled from [[Moscow University]]. After the [[October Revolution]], he was reinstated and appointed professor. Ilya's uncle, [[Semyon Frank]], a noted Russian philosopher, wasn't as fortunate and was expelled from the USSR in 1922 together with 160 other intellectuals. Ilya had one elder brother, Gleb Mikhailovich Frank, who became an eminent [[biophysicist]] and member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R.]].<ref name="PANbio">{{cite journal

Ilya Frank studied mathematics and [[theoretical physics]] at [[Moscow State University]]. From his second year he worked in the laboratory of [[Sergey Ivanovich Vavilov]], whom he regarded as his mentor. After graduating in 1930, on recommendation of Vavilov, he started working at the State Optical Institute in Leningrad. There he wrote his first publication—about [[luminescence]]— with Vavilov. The work he did there would form the basis of his doctoral dissertation in 1935.<ref name="PANbio"/>

In 1934, Frank moved to the Institute of Physics and Mathematics of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]] (which shortly would be moved to Moscow, where it was transformed into the Institute of Physics). Here he started working on [[nuclear physics]], a new field for him. He became interested in the [[Vavilov–Cherenkov effect|effect]] discovered by [[Pavel Cherenkov]], that charged particles moving through water at high speeds emit light. Together with [[Igor Tamm]], he developed a theoretical explanation: the effect occurs when charged particles travel through an optically transparent medium at speeds greater than the [[refractive index|speed of light in that medium]], causing a [[shock wave]] in the [[electromagnetic field]].<ref name="PANbio"/>  The amount of energy radiated in this process is given by the [[Frank–Tamm formula]].

The discovery and explanation of the effect resulted in the development of new methods for detecting and measuring the velocity of high-speed [[nuclear particle]]s and became of great importance for research in [[nuclear physics]]. [[Cherenkov radiation]] is also widely used in biomedical research for detection of [[radioactive isotopes]]. In 1946, Cherenkov,  Vavilov, Tamm, and Frank were awarded a [[State Stalin Prize|Stalin Prize]] for their discovery, and 1958 Cherenkov, Tamm, and Frank received the [[Nobel Prize in physics]].<ref name="PANbio"/>

In 1944, Frank was appointed professor and became head of a department at the Institute of Physics and of the Nuclear Physics Laboratory (which was later transferred to the Institute of Nuclear Research). Frank's laboratory was involved in the (then secret) study of [[nuclear reactor]]s. In particular, they studied the diffusion and thermalization of [[neutron]]s.<ref name="PANbio"/>

In 1957, Frank also become director of the Laboratory of Neutron Physics at the [[Joint Institute for Nuclear Research]]. The laboratory was based on the neutron fast-pulse reactor (IBR) then under construction at the site. Under Frank's supervision the reactor was used in the development of [[neutron spectroscopy]] techniques.<ref name="PANbio"/>

==Personal life==
Frank married the noted [[historian]], Ella Abramovna Beilikhis, in 1937. Their son, Alexander, was born in the same year, and would continue much of the studies of his father as a physicist.<ref name="PANbio"/>
