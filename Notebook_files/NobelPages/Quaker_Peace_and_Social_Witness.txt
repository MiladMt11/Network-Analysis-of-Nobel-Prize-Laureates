==History==
The roots of QPSW are in the missionary work done under the name of ''Friends Foreign Mission Association'' (1868–1927). With the decline of the missions, the ''Mission Association'' merged with the ''Council for International Service'' (1919–1927) to form the ''Friends Service Council'' (1927–1978). Which was renamed ''Quaker Peace and Service'' (1979–2000), known as ''Quaker Peace & Social Witness'' since 2001.
