==Life==
Georges Charpak was born Jerzy Charpak to [[Jewish]] parents, Anna (Szapiro) and Maurice Charpak, in the village of Dąbrowica in [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] (now [[Dubrovytsia]] in [[Ukraine]]). Charpak's family moved from [[Poland]] to [[Paris]] when he was seven years old, beginning his study of mathematics in 1941 at the Lycée Saint Louis.<ref name="Scientific Information Service ">CERN {{cite book | url =http://library.web.cern.ch/library/Archives/isad/isacharpak.html| title = Scientific Information Service - Archive | publisher = CERN| access-date = 2012-01-29}}</ref> The actor and film director [[André Charpak]] was his brother.

During [[World War II]] Charpak served in the [[French Resistance|resistance]] and was imprisoned by [[Vichy France|Vichy]] authorities in 1943. In 1944 he was deported to the [[Nazis|Nazi]] [[concentration camp]] at [[Dachau concentration camp|Dachau]], where he remained until the camp was liberated in 1945.

After ''[[Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles|classes préparatoires]]'' studies at [[Lycée Saint-Louis]] in Paris and later at [[Citadel of Montpellier|Lycée Joffre]] in Montpellier,<ref>[http://www.lyceejoffre.net/cpge/blog/2010/10/15/georges-charpak-1924-2010/#more-899 "Tribulations d’un immigré d’Europe centrale, Georges Charpak"] on Lycée Joffre website {{in lang|fr}}</ref> he joined in 1945 the Paris-based [[École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris|École des Mines]], one of the most prestigious engineering schools in France. The following year he became a naturalized French citizen. He graduated in 1948, earning the French degree of ''Civil Engineer of Mines'' (''Ingénieur Civil des Mines'' equivalent to a [[Master's degree]]) becoming a pupil in the laboratory of [[Frédéric Joliot-Curie]] at the [[Collège de France]] during 1949,<ref name="Scientific Information Service "/><ref>Georges Charpak  - ''Research on particle imaging detectors'' - 650 pages  ''Volume 6 of World Scientific series in 20th century physics''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wm9FPYS_JxEC&pg=PR7&lpg=PR7&dq=Georg+Charpak+thesis+very+low+energy+emission&source=bl&ots=0v0QVGrxZ6&sig=2HUT9bHVQtQpGWqjyz0Vws4EKPg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=obolT_GbIITI0QXf__XyDg&sqi=2&ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ# World Scientific, 1995] 29 Jan 2012  {{ISBN|981-02-1902-4}}</ref> the year after Curie had directed construction of the first ''atomic pile'' within France.<ref>"Frédéric Joliot - Biography".

In 1959,  he joined the staff of [[CERN]] ([[CERN|European Organization for Nuclear Research]]) in [[Geneva]], where he invented and developed<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/0029-554X(70)90872-4|title = Investigation of some properties of multiwire proportional chambers|journal = Nuclear Instruments and Methods|volume = 88|issue = 1|pages = 149–161|year = 1970|last1 = Bouclier|first1 = R.|last2 = Charpak|first2 = G.|last3 = Dimčovski|first3 = Z.|last4 = Fischer|first4 = G.|last5 = Sauli|first5 = F.|last6 = Coignet|first6 = G.|last7 = Flügge|first7 = G.|bibcode = 1970NucIM..88..149B}}</ref> the [[multiwire proportional chamber]].

In 1980, Georges Charpak became professor-in-residence at École supérieure de physique et de chimie industrielles in Paris ([[ESPCI]]) and held the Joliot-Curie Chair there in 1984.  This is where he developed and demonstrated the powerful applications of the particle detectors he invented, most notably for enabling better health diagnostics. 
He was the co-founder of a number of start-up in the biolab arena, including Molecular Engines Laboratories, Biospace Instruments and SuperSonic Imagine – together with [[Mathias Fink]]. He was elected to the [[French Academy of Sciences]] on 20 May 1985.

Georges Charpak was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1992 "for his invention and development of [[particle detector]]s, in particular the [[multiwire proportional chamber]]", with affiliations to both École supérieure de physique et de chimie industrielles ([[ESPCI]]) and CERN. This was the last time a single person was awarded the physics prize, as of 2020. In 1999, Charpak received the Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Golden Plate Awardees of the American Academy of Achievement |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://achievement.org/our-history/golden-plate-awards/#science-exploration}}</ref>

In France, Charpak was a very strong advocate for [[nuclear power]].  Charpak was a member of the Board of Sponsors of the [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]].<ref>[http://www.thebulletin.org/content/about-us/board-of-sponsors Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists: Board of Sponsors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420084037/http://www.thebulletin.org/content/about-us/board-of-sponsors |date=2009-04-20 }}.

Charpak married Dominique Vidal in 1953. They had three children.<ref>{{cite news|title=Georges Charpak dies at 86; French physicist won Nobel Prize|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/oct/08/local/la-me-georges-charpak-20101008|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=October 8, 2010|first=Thomas H.|last=Maugh II}}</ref> The pediatrician [[Nathalie Charpak]] (born 1955) is his daughter.
