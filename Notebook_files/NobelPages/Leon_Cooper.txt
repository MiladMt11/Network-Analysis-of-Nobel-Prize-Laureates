'''Leon N. Cooper<ref>Many printed materials, including the [[Nobel Prize]] [[website]], have referred to Cooper as "Leon Neil Cooper". However, the middle initial [[N]] does not stand for Neil, or for any other name.

In 1969 Cooper married Kay Allard. They have two children.<ref name="Carey2014">{{cite book|author=Carey, Charles W. |title=American Scientists|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=00r9waSNv1cC&pg=PA66|date=2014|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-0807-0|page=66}}</ref>

He has carried out research at various institutions including the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] and the European Organization for Nuclear Research ([[CERN]]) in [[Geneva]], Switzerland.

Cooper is the author of [http://www.cambridge.org/academic/subjects/physics/history-philosophy-and-foundations-physics/science-and-human-experience-values-culture-and-mind?format=HB Science and Human Experience] – a collection of essays, including previously unpublished material, on issues such as consciousness and the structure of space.
(Cambridge University Press, 2014).

Cooper is the author of an unconventional liberal-arts physics textbook, originally ''An Introduction to the Meaning and Structure of Physics'' (Harper and Row, 1968)<ref>{{cite journal|title=Review of ''An Introduction to the Meaning and Structure of Physics'' by Leon N.
