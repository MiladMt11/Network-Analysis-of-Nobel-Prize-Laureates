==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Ciechanover was born in [[Haifa|Haifa, Israel]] on 1 October 1947.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Irwin-Rose|title=Irwin Rose {{!}} American biochemist|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> He is the son of Bluma (Lubashevsky), a teacher of English, and Yitzhak Ciechanover, an office worker.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/5635/Ciechanover-Aaron-1947.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-02-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621130411/http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/5635/Ciechanover-Aaron-1947.html |archive-date=2013-06-21 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  His mother and father supported the Zionist movement and immigrated to Israel from Poland in the 1920s.

=== Education ===
He earned a master's degree in science in 1971 and graduated from [[Hadassah Medical School]] in [[Jerusalem]] in 1974. He received his doctorate in biochemistry in 1981 from the [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology]] in Haifa before conducting postdoctoral research in the laboratory of [[Harvey Lodish]] at the [[Whitehead Institute]] at [[MIT]] from 1981 to 1984.

=== Recent ===
Ciechanover is currently a Technion Distinguished Research Professor in the [[Ruth and Bruce Rappaport Faculty of Medicine]] and Research Institute at the Technion. He is a member of the [[Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities]], the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences]], and is a foreign associate of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]]. In 2008, he was a visiting Distinguished Chair Professor at [[National Cheng Kung University|NCKU, Taiwan]]. As part of Shenzhen's 13th Five-Year Plan funding research in emerging technologies and opening "Nobel laureate research labs", in 2018 he opened the Ciechanover Institute of Precision and Regenerative Medicine at the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen]] campus.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ciechanover Institute of Precision and Regenerative Medicine Established {{!}} CUHK-Shenzhen|url=https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/en/article/3404|access-date=2021-03-20|website=www.cuhk.edu.cn}}</ref> 

=== Nobel Prize ===
Ciechanover is one of Israel's first [[Nobel Laureates]] in [[Science]], earning his Nobel Prize in 2004 for his work in ubiquitination. He is honored for playing a central role in the history of Israel and in the [[history of the Technion – Israel Institute of Technology]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2004|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2004/ciechanover/facts/|access-date=2021-04-23|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US}}</ref>
