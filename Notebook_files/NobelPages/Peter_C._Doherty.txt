==Early life and education==
Peter Charles Doherty was born in the [[Brisbane]] suburb of [[Sherwood, Queensland|Sherwood]] on 15 October 1940, to Eric Charles Doherty and Linda Doherty (née Byford).<ref>{{cite news |title=Births |url=https://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article40917512 |work=The Courier-Mail |date=21 October 1940 |at=p. 6, col. 1|access-date=2 September 2021}}</ref><ref name=nobel-bio>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1996/doherty-bio.html|title=Peter C.

He obtained his PhD in pathology{{hsp}}<ref>https://www.aai.org/About/History/Notable-Members/Nobel-Laureates/PeterCDoherty</ref> in 1970 from the [[University of Edinburgh]], Scotland,<ref name="phd">{{Cite thesis|degree=PhD|last=Doherty|first=Peter Charles|date=1970|title=Studies in the experimental pathology of louping-ill encephalitis|id={{EThOS|699841}}|hdl=1842/17153|df=dmy-all}} {{free access}}</ref> then returned to Australia to continue his  research at the [[John Curtin School of Medical Research]] within the [[Australian National University]] in [[Canberra]].

==Research and career==
Doherty's research focuses<ref name=gs>{{Google scholar id}}</ref><ref name=scopus>{{Scopus id}}</ref> on the [[immune system]] and his Nobel work described how the body's immune cells protect against viruses. He and Rolf Zinkernagel, the co-recipient of the 1996 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, discovered how [[T cell]]s recognise their target antigens in combination with [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC) proteins.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Immunity scientists win Nobel prize|last=Hawkes|first=Nigel|date=8 October 1996|work=The Times (London)|page=13}}</ref>

Viruses infect host cells and reproduce inside them. Killer T-cells destroy those infected cells so that the viruses cannot reproduce. Zinkernagel and Doherty discovered that, in order for killer T cells to recognise infected cells, they had to recognise two molecules on the surface of the cell – not only the virus antigen, but also a molecule of the [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC). This recognition was done by a T-cell receptor on the surface of the T cell. The MHC was previously identified as being responsible for the rejection of incompatible tissues during transplantation. Zinkernagel and Doherty discovered that the MHC was responsible for the body fighting [[meningitis viruses]] too.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1996/press-release/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1996|access-date=25 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181025081627/https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1996/press-release/|archive-date=25 October 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
