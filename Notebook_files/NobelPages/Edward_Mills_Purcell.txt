'''Edward Mills Purcell''' (August 30, 1912 – March 7, 1997) was an [[United States|American]] physicist who shared  the 1952 [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] for his independent discovery (published 1946) of nuclear magnetic resonance in liquids and in solids.<ref name="frs">{{Cite journal | last1 = Bleaney | first1 = B. | author-link = Brebis Bleaney| doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1999.0029 | title = Edward Mills Purcell. 30 August 1912 -- 7 March 1997: Elected For.Mem.R.S. 1989 | journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 45 | pages = 437–447 | year = 1999 | doi-access = free }}</ref>  [[Nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) has become widely used to study the [[Molecule|molecular structure]] of pure materials and the composition of mixtures. Friends and colleagues knew him as '''Ed Purcell'''.

==Biography==
Born and raised in [[Taylorville, Illinois]], Purcell received his [[Bachelor of Engineering|BSEE]] in [[electrical engineering]] from [[Purdue University]], followed by his M.A. and Ph.D. in physics from [[Harvard University]]. He was a member of the Alpha Xi chapter of the [[Phi Kappa Sigma]] fraternity while at Purdue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greek101.com/lounge/famous.php?org=Phi%20Kappa%20Sigma|title=Famous Phi Kappa Sigma's - Famous Fraternity & Sorority Greeks - Greek 101|work=greek101.com}}</ref> After spending the years of [[World War II]] working at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] Radiation Laboratory on the development of microwave radar, Purcell returned to Harvard to do research.  In December 1946, he discovered [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) with his colleagues [[Robert Pound]] and Henry Torrey.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Purcell | first1 = E. | author-link1 = Edward Mills Purcell| last2 = Torrey | first2 = H. | last3 = Pound | first3 = R. | title = Resonance Absorption by Nuclear Magnetic Moments in a Solid | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.69.37 | journal = Physical Review | volume = 69 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 37–38 | year = 1946 |bibcode = 1946PhRv...69...37P | doi-access = free }}</ref>  NMR provides scientists with an elegant and precise way of determining chemical structure and properties of materials, and is widely used in physics and chemistry.  It also is the basis of [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI), one of the most important medical advances of the 20th century.  For his discovery of NMR, Purcell shared the 1952 Nobel Prize in physics with [[Felix Bloch]] of [[Stanford University]].

Purcell also made contributions to [[astronomy]] as the first to detect radio emissions from neutral galactic hydrogen (the famous [[Hydrogen line|21 cm line]] due to [[hyperfine splitting]]), affording the first views of the spiral arms of the [[Milky Way]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Ewen | first1 = H. I. | last2 = Purcell | first2 = E. M. | author-link2 = Edward Mills Purcell| doi = 10.1038/168356a0 | title = Observation of a Line in the Galactic Radio Spectrum: Radiation from Galactic Hydrogen at 1,420 Mc./sec | journal = Nature | volume = 168 | issue = 4270 | pages = 356 | year = 1951 |bibcode = 1951Natur.168..356E | s2cid = 27595927 }}</ref>  This observation helped launch the field of [[radio astronomy]], and measurements of the 21&nbsp;cm line are still an important technique in modern astronomy.  He has also made  seminal contributions to [[Solid-state physics|solid state physics]], with studies of spin-echo relaxation, nuclear magnetic relaxation, and negative spin temperature (important in the development of the laser).  With [[Norman F. Ramsey]], he was the first to question the [[CP-violation|CP symmetry]] of particle physics.

Purcell was the recipient of many awards for his scientific, educational, and civic work.  He served as science advisor to Presidents [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[John F. Kennedy]], and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].  He was president of the [[American Physical Society]], and a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]], the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].  He was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]] in 1979, and the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory#Jansky Prize|Jansky Lectureship]] before the [[National Radio Astronomy Observatory]]. Purcell was also inducted into his Fraternity's ([[Phi Kappa Sigma]]) Hall of Fame as the first Phi Kap ever to receive a Nobel Prize.

Purcell was the author of the innovative introductory text ''[[Electricity and Magnetism (book)|Electricity and Magnetism]]''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A2rS5vlSFq0C|title=Electricity and Magnetism|isbn=9781107014022|last1=Purcell|first1=Edward M.|last2=Morin|first2=David J.|date=2013-01-21}}</ref> The book, a [[Space race|Sputnik-era]] project funded by an NSF grant, was influential for its [[Relativistic electromagnetism|use of relativity]] in the presentation of the subject at this level. The 1965 edition, now freely available due to a condition of the federal grant, was originally published as a volume of the ''[[Berkeley Physics Course]]''. The book is also in print as a commercial third edition, as Purcell and Morin. Purcell is also remembered by biologists for his famous lecture "Life at Low [[Reynolds number|Reynolds Number]]",<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Purcell | first1 = E. M. | author-link = Edward Mills Purcell| doi = 10.1119/1.10903 | title = Life at low Reynolds number | journal = American Journal of Physics | volume = 45 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–11 | year = 1977 |bibcode = 1977AmJPh..45....3P | url = https://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/226838/1/bussei_el_063101.pdf | hdl = 2433/226838 | hdl-access = free }}</ref> in which he explained forces and effects dominating in limiting flow regimes (often at the micro scale). He also emphasized the time-reversibility of low Reynolds number flows with a principle referred to as the [[Scallop theorem]].
