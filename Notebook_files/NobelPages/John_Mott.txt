'''John Raleigh Mott''' (May 25, 1865 – January 31, 1955) was an evangelist and long-serving leader of the Young Men's Christian Association ([[YMCA]]) and the [[World Student Christian Federation]] (WSCF).  He received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1946 for his work in establishing and strengthening international Protestant [[Christianity|Christian]] student organizations that worked to [[peace movement|promote peace]]. He shared the prize with [[Emily Balch]]. From 1895 until 1920 Mott was the General Secretary of the WSCF. Intimately involved in the formation of the [[World Council of Churches]] in 1948, that body elected him as a lifelong honorary President.  His best-known book, ''The Evangelization of the World in this Generation'', became a missionary slogan in the early 20th century.<ref>Cracknell & White, 233</ref>

==Biography==
Mott was born in [[Livingston Manor, New York]], [[Sullivan County, New York]] on May 25, 1865, and his family moved to [[Postville, Iowa]] in September of the same year. He attended [[Upper Iowa University]], where he studied history and was an award-winning student debater. He transferred to [[Cornell University]], where he received his [[bachelor's degree]] in 1888. He was influenced by [[Arthur Tappan Pierson]] one of the forces behind the [[Student Volunteer Movement|Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions]], which was founded in 1886. 

In 1910, Mott, an [[United Methodist Church|American Methodist]] layperson, presided at the [[1910 World Missionary Conference]], which was an important milestone in the modern [[Protestant]] [[Mission (Christian)|missions movement]] and some say the modern [[Christian ecumenism|ecumenical movement]].

Mott and a colleague were offered free passage on the ''[[Titanic]]'' in 1912 by a [[White Star Line]] official who was interested in their work, but they declined and took the more humble liner the [[SS Lapland|SS ''Lapland'']]. According to a biography by C. Howard Hopkins, upon hearing of the news in [[New York City]], the two men looked at each other and remarked that, "The Good Lord must have more work for us to do."<ref>{{cite web| title= Seven Famous People Who Missed the Titanic | author=Greg Daugherty| publisher=Smithsonian Magazine| url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/Seven-Famous-People-Who-Missed-the-Titanic.html|  date=March 2012}}</ref>

After touring Europe and promoting ecumenism, Mott traveled to Asia where, from October 1912 to May 1913, he held a series of 18 regional and national conferences, including in Ceylon, India, Burma, Malaya, China, Korea and Japan.<ref>A History of the Ecumenical Movement 1517-1848, 2d edition, p. 364</ref>

He also worked with [[Robert Hallowell Gardiner III]] to maintain relations with the Russian Orthodox Church and Archbishop Tikhon after the Russian Revolution.

From 1920 until 1928, Mott served as the WSCF Chairperson. For his labors in both missions and ecumenism, as well as for peace, some historians consider him to be "the most widely traveled and universally trusted Christian leader of his time".<ref>Cracknell & White, 243</ref>

== Personal life and legacy ==
Mott married twice. His first wife was a teacher, Leila Ada White. They married in 1891 and had two sons and two daughters, including [[Irene Mott Bose]], a social worker in India, and wife of Indian Supreme Court justice [[Vivian Bose]]; [[John Livingstone Mott]], who received the [[Kaisar-i-Hind Medal|Kaisar-i‐Hind]] silver medal in 1931, for his work with the [[YMCA]] in India;<ref>{{Cite news|date=1973-07-21|title=John Mott, Headed International Unit|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/07/21/archives/john-mott-headed-international-unit.html|access-date=2021-11-26|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> and [[Frederick Dodge Mott]], who worked in healthcare planning in Canada, and was Canada's representative to the [[World Health Organization]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Houston|first=C.
