'''John Cromwell Mather''' (born August 7, 1946, [[Roanoke, Virginia]]) is an American [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]], [[cosmology|cosmologist]] and [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] laureate for his work on the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|Cosmic Background Explorer Satellite (COBE)]] with [[George Smoot]].

This work helped cement the [[big-bang]] theory of the universe. According to the Nobel Prize committee, "the COBE-project can also be regarded as the starting point for [[cosmology]] as a precision science."<ref name=nobel>{{cite press release| url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2006/press.html | title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2006 | publisher=The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences | date=3 October 2006 | access-date=2006-10-05}}</ref>

Mather is a senior astrophysicist at the [[NASA]] [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] (GSFC) in [[Maryland]] and adjunct professor of physics at the [[University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences]]. In 2007, Mather was listed among [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine's]] 100 Most Influential People in The World. In October, 2012, he was listed again by [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] in a special issue on New Space Discoveries as one of 25 most influential people in space.

Mather is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President [[George W. Bush]] in May 2008, urging him to "reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill" by requesting additional emergency funding for the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]â€™s [[Office of Science]], the [[National Science Foundation]], and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=A Letter from America's Physics Nobel Laureates|url=https://fire.pppl.gov/nobel_bush_fy08_050808.pdf}}</ref>

Mather is also the senior project scientist for the [[James Webb Space Telescope]] (JWST), a space telescope scheduled to be launched to [[Lagrange Point]] L2 in December 2021.

In 2014, Mather delivered an address on the Webb Space Telescope at the second [[Starmus Festival]] in the Canary Islands.
