He was born as '''Hideki Ogawa''' in [[Tokyo]] and grew up in [[Kyoto]] with two older brothers, two older sisters, and two younger brothers.<ref name="Tabibito">{{cite book | last=Yukawa | first = Hideki | title=Tabibito (旅人) = The Traveler | publisher=World Scientific | year=1982 | isbn=9971950103 | pages = 46–47 & 118; 121–123; 10; Foreword; 141 & 163 | doi = 10.1142/0014 | s2cid = 124612924 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/3d27de1e5038c2d4c41135ed6b9e8584b0494246 }}</ref> He read the Confucian ''[[Doctrine of the Mean]]'', and later [[Lao-Tzu]] and [[Zhuang Zhou|Chuang-Tzu]]. His father, for a time, considered sending him to technical college rather than university since he was "not as outstanding a student as his older brothers". However, when his father broached the idea with his middle school principal, the principal praised his "high potential" in mathematics and offered to adopt Ogawa himself in order to keep him on a scholarly career. At that, his father relented.

Ogawa decided against becoming a mathematician when in high school; his teacher marked his exam answer as incorrect when Ogawa proved a theorem but in a different manner than the teacher expected.<ref name="Tabibito"/> He decided against a career in experimental physics in college when he demonstrated clumsiness in glassblowing, a requirement for experiments in [[spectroscopy]].<ref name="Tabibito"/>

In 1929, after receiving his degree from [[Kyoto Imperial University]], he stayed on as a lecturer for four years. After graduation, he was interested in [[theoretical physics]], particularly in the theory of [[elementary particle]]s. In 1932, he married {{nihongo|Sumi Yukawa|[[:ja:湯川スミ|スミ]]}}. In accordance with Japanese customs of the time, since he came from a family with many sons but his father-in-law Genyo had none, he was adopted by Genyo and changed his family name from Ogawa to Yukawa.<ref name="Tabibito"/> The couple had two sons, Harumi and Takaaki. In 1933 he became an assistant professor at [[Osaka University]], at 26 years old.

In 1935 he published his theory of [[meson]]s, which explained the interaction between [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, and was a major influence on research into elementary particles.<ref>{{cite journal |year=1935 |title=On the Interaction of Elementary Particles |url=http://web.ihep.su/dbserv/compas/src/yukawa35/eng.pdf|journal=Proc. Phys.-Math. Soc. Jpn. |volume=17 |issue=48 |author=Yukawa, H. }}</ref> In 1940 he became a professor in [[Kyoto University]]. In 1940 he won the [[Imperial Prize of the Japan Academy]], in 1943 the [[Person of Cultural Merit|Decoration of Cultural Merit]] from the [[Japanese government]]. In 1949 he became a professor at [[Columbia University]], the same year he received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], after the discovery by [[Cecil Frank Powell]], [[Giuseppe Occhialini]] and [[César Lattes]] of Yukawa's predicted [[pion|pi meson]] in 1947. Yukawa also worked on the theory of [[K-capture]], in which a low energy electron is absorbed by the nucleus, after its initial prediction by [[G. C. Wick]].<ref>Segré, Emilio (1987) "K-Electron Capture by Nuclei", pp. 11–12, chapter 3 in ''Discovering Alvarez: selected works of Luis W.

Yukawa became the first chairman of [[Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics]] in 1953. He received a Doctorate, ''[[honoris causa]],'' from the [[University of Paris]] and honorary memberships in the [[Royal Society]],<ref name="frs"/> [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], the [[Indian Academy of Sciences]], the International Academy of Philosophy and Sciences{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, and the [[Pontifical Academy of Sciences|Pontificia Academia Scientiarum]].

He was an editor of ''Progress of Theoretical Physics'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics |author2=Gakkai, Nihon Butsuri |title=Progress of Theoretical Physics |location=Kyoto |publisher=Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics and Physical Society of Japan |year=1946 |url=http://ptp.ipap.jp/journal/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020203114022/http://ptp.ipap.jp/journal/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2002-02-03 |oclc=44519062 |access-date=2008-03-03 }}</ref> and published the books ''Introduction to Quantum Mechanics'' (1946) and ''Introduction to the Theory of Elementary Particles'' (1948).

In 1955, he joined ten other leading scientists and intellectuals in signing the [[Russell–Einstein Manifesto]], calling for [[nuclear disarmament]].

Yukawa retired from Kyoto University in 1970 as a Professor Emeritus. Owing to increasing infirmity, in his final years he appeared in public in a wheelchair. He died at his home in Sakyo-ku, Kyoto, on 8 September 1981 from pneumonia and heart failure, aged&nbsp;74. His tomb is in [[Higashiyama-ku, Kyoto]].

Solo violinist [[Diana Yukawa]] (ダイアナ湯川) is a relative of Hideki Yukawa.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
