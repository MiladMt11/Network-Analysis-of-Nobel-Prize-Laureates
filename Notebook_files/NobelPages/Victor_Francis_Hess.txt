'''Victor Franz Hess''' (24 June 1883{{spaced ndash}}17 December 1964) was an [[Austria]]n-[[United States|American]] [[physicist]], and [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel laureate in physics]], who discovered [[cosmic ray]]s.<ref name=obit/>

== Biography ==
He was born to Vinzenz Hess and Serafine Edle von Grossbauer-Waldstätt, in [[w:de:Schloss Waldstein (Deutschfeistritz)|Waldstein Castle]], near Peggau in [[Duchy of Styria|Styria]], [[Austria]], on 24 June 1883. His father was a royal forester in Prince [[Louis of Oettingen-Wallerstein]]'s service. He attended secondary school at [[Graz]] Gymnasium from 1893 to 1901.<ref name="nobel">{{cite web

From 1901 to 1905, Hess was an undergraduate student at the [[University of Graz]], and continued postgraduate studies in physics until he received his PhD there in 1910. He worked as Assistant under [[Stefan Meyer (physicist)|Stefan Meyer]] at the [[Institute for Radium Research, Vienna|Institute for Radium Research]], Viennese Academy of Sciences, from 1910 to 1920.

In 1920 he married Marie Bertha Warner Breisky.<ref name=obit />

Hess took a leave of absence in 1921 and travelled to the United States, working at the [[United States Radium Corporation]], in [[New Jersey]], and as Consulting Physicist for the [[US Bureau of Mines]], in [[Washington, D.C.]] In 1923, he returned to the University of Graz, and was appointed the Ordinary Professor of Experimental Physics in 1925. The [[University of Innsbruck]] appointed him Professor, and Director Institute of Radiology, in 1931.<ref name="nobel" />

Hess relocated to the United States with his [[Jew]]ish wife in 1938, in order to escape [[Nazi]] persecution. The same year [[Fordham University]] appointed him Professor of Physics, and he later became a naturalized United States citizen in 1944.<ref name=NYTimes>{{cite news

Between 1911 and 1913, Hess undertook the work that won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1936. For many years, scientists had been puzzled by the levels of ionizing radiation measured in the atmosphere. The assumption at the time was that the radiation would decrease as the distance from the earth, the then assumed source of the radiation, increased. The [[electroscope]]s previously used gave an approximate measurement of the radiation, but indicated that at greater altitude in the atmosphere the level of radiation might actually be higher than that on the ground. Hess approached this mystery first by greatly increasing the precision of the measuring equipment, and then by personally taking the equipment aloft in a balloon. He systematically measured the radiation at altitudes up to {{convert|5.3|km|mi|1}} during 1911–1912. The daring flights were made both by day and during the night, at significant risk to himself.<ref name="Angelo"/>

The result of Hess's meticulous work was published in the Proceedings of the Viennese Academy of Sciences, and showed the level of radiation decreased up to an altitude of about {{convert|1|km|mi|1}}, but above that the level increased considerably, with the radiation detected at {{convert|5|km|mi|1}}, being about twice that at sea level.<ref>

Hess's discovery opened the door to many new discoveries in [[Particle physics|particle]] and [[nuclear physics]].<ref name="Angelo"/> In particular, both the [[positron]] and the [[muon]] were first discovered in cosmic rays by [[Carl David Anderson]]. Hess and Anderson shared the 1936 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].
