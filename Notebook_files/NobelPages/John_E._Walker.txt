==Early life and education==
Walker was born in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], [[Yorkshire]], the son of Thomas Ernest Walker, a stonemason, and Elsie Lawton, an amateur musician. He was brought up with his two younger sisters (Judith and Gen) in a rural environment and went to [[Rastrick Grammar School]]. At school, he was a keen sportsman and specialized in physical sciences and mathematics during his final three years there. He received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in Chemistry from [[St Catherine's College, Oxford]].<ref name="Curriculum-Vitae">{{cite web|url=http://www.mrc-mbu.cam.ac.uk/people/walker/|title=John Walker - Curriculum vitae - Mitochondrial Biology Unit|work=cam.ac.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Nobelprize|accessdate=2020-04-29}}</ref> Walker began his study of [[peptide]] antibiotics with [[Edward Abraham]] at Oxford in 1965 and received his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in 1969.<ref name="thesis"/><ref name="Curriculum-Vitae"/> During this period, he became interested in developments in [[molecular biology]].

==Career and research==
From 1969 to 1971, Walker worked at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], and from 1971&ndash;1974 in France. He met [[Fred Sanger]]<ref name=sanger>{{Cite journal

This resulted in an invitation to work at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology of the Medical Research Council, which became a long-term appointment. Among the other staff was [[Francis Crick]], who was well known for his discovery of the molecular structure of [[DNA]]. At first, he analyzed the sequences of [[protein]]s and then uncovered details of the modified genetic code in [[mitochondria]]. In 1978, he decided to apply protein chemical methods to membrane proteins. In this way, Walker characterized the subunit composition of proteins in the mitochondrial membrane and the DNA sequence of the mitochondrial genome.

His landmark crystallographic studies of the F1-ATPase, the catalytic region of the ATP synthase  (done in collaboration with crystallographer Andrew Leslie), from bovine heart mitochondria revealed the three catalytic sites in three different conformations imposed by the position of the asymmetric central stalk. This structure supported the binding change mechanism and rotary catalysis for the ATP synthase (and related enzymes), one of the catalytic mechanisms proposed by Paul Boyer. This work, published in 1994, led to Walker's share of the 1997 Nobel prize for chemistry. Since this structure, Walker and his colleagues have produced most of the crystal structures in the PDB of mitochondrial ATP synthase, including transition state structures and protein with bound inhibitors and antibiotics. Scientists trained in Walker's group at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge or MRC Mitochondrial Biology Unit have gone on to determine crystal bacterial complex I and cryo-EM maps of mitochondrial complex I and vacuolar type ATPases.

===Awards and honours===
Walker was elected an [[EMBO Member]] in 1984.<ref name=membo/> He shared his Nobel Prize with the American chemist [[Paul D. Boyer]] for their elucidation of the enzymatic mechanism underlying the synthesis of [[adenosine triphosphate]]. They also shared the prize with [[Denmark|Danish]] chemist [[Jens C. Skou]] for research unrelated to theirs (Discovery of the [[Na+/K+-ATPase]]). Sir John was knighted in 1999 for services to molecular biology. He is a member of the Advisory Council for the [[Campaign for Science and Engineering]].<ref name="CaSE Advisory Council">{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencecampaign.org.uk/about/who/advisory.htm |title=Advisory Council of the Campaign for Science and Engineering |access-date=2011-02-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828110110/http://www.sciencecampaign.org.uk/about/who/advisory.htm |archive-date=28 August 2010 }}</ref> He was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1995|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1995]].<ref name=frs/> Walker is also a Foreign Associate of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] and an Honorary Fellow of St Catherine's College, Oxford.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mrc-mbu.cam.ac.uk/people/walker/honours-and-awards|title=John Walker - Honours and Awards - Mitochondrial Biology Unit|work=cam.ac.uk}}</ref> He became a foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|author=Anon |url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/foreign-members/4970 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160214204611/https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/foreign-members/4970 |title=J.E.
