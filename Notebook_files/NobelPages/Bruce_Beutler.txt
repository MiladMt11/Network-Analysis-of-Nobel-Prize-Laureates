'''Bruce Alan Beutler''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɔɪ|t|l|ər}} {{respell|BOYT|lər}}; born December 29, 1957) is an American immunologist and geneticist.<ref>http://www.jinfo.org/Nobels_Medicine.html.</ref> Together with [[Jules A. Hoffmann]], he received one-half of the 2011 [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]], for "their discoveries concerning the activation of innate immunity" (the other half went to [[Ralph M. Steinman]] for "his discovery of the dendritic cell and its role in [[adaptive immunity]]").<ref name="Nobel">{{cite press release|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2011/press.html|title=Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2011|publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|date=3 October 2011}}</ref>

Beutler is currently director of the Center for the Genetics of Host Defense at the [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center]] in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]].<ref name="profile">{{Cite journal | last1 = Ravindran | first1 = S. | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1311624110 | title = Profile of Bruce A.

==Education==
Between 1959 and 1977, Beutler lived in Southern California. He received his secondary school education at [[Polytechnic School]] in Pasadena, California. He attended college at the [[University of California, San Diego]], graduating at the age of 18 in 1976. He enrolled in medical school at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1977 and received his M.D. degree in 1981 at the age of 23.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

During his childhood and early adolescent years, Beutler developed a lasting interest in biological science. Some of his formative experiences in biology included studies in the laboratory of his father, and later, in the [[City of Hope National Medical Center|City of Hope]] laboratory of [[Susumu Ohno]], a mammalian geneticist known for his work on evolution, genome structure, and sex differentiation. In addition, he worked in the laboratories of [[Abraham Braude]], an expert in the biology of [[lipopolysaccharide]] (LPS), also known as [[endotoxin]], and [[Patricia G. Spear|Patricia Spear]], an authority on [[Herpes simplex virus]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bundesen|first=L. Q.|date=2004-08-16|title=Biography of Patricia G. Spear|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=101|issue=34|pages=12411–12413|doi=10.1073/pnas.0405440101|pmid=15314223|pmc=515076|issn=0027-8424|doi-access=free}}</ref> Later, Beutler was to perform extensive research on both LPS and herpesviruses, aimed principally at understanding inborn host resistance to infectious diseases, often referred to as [[innate immunity]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Academic positions==
Beutler majored in biology as an undergraduate at the [[University of California, San Diego]], where he graduated in 1976 at the age of 18.  He attended medical school at the University of Chicago.  From 1981 to 1983 Beutler continued his medical training at the [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center]] in Dallas, Texas, as an intern in the Department of Internal Medicine, and as a resident in the Department of Neurology. Between 1983 and 1985 he was a postdoctoral fellow at [[Rockefeller University]] in the laboratory of [[Anthony Cerami]]. He became an assistant professor at Rockefeller University in 1985. He was also an associate physician at the Rockefeller University Hospital between 1984 and 1986.

Beutler returned to Dallas in 1986 as an assistant professor in the Department of Internal Medicine of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, and an assistant investigator at the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]], where he retained a position for the next 14 years. He became an associate professor and an associate investigator with HHMI in 1990, and a professor in 1996.

In 2000, Beutler moved to [[The Scripps Research Institute]] in La Jolla, California, as a professor in the department of immunology. In 2007, he became chairman of the newly created Department of Genetics at Scripps Research. In 2011, Beutler returned to UT Southwestern Medical Center to become director of the Center for the Genetics of Host Defense.

On October 4, 2011, Beutler was named regental professor of the [[University of Texas System]].<ref>http://www.utsouthwestern.edu/newsroom/news-releases/year-2011/internationally-acclaimed-immunologist-to-lead-new-center-at-ut-southwestern.html</ref>

Passive immunization against cachectin/tumor necrosis factor protects mice from lethal effect of endotoxin. Science 229(4716):869-71, 1985</ref> Subsequently, he invented recombinant molecules expressly designed to neutralize TNF, fusing the binding portion of TNF receptor proteins to the heavy chain of an immunoglobulin molecule to force receptor dimerization.<ref>Peppel, K., et al. A tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-IgG heavy chain chimeric protein as a bivalent antagonist of TNF activity. J.Exp.Med. 174(6):1483-9, 1991</ref> These molecules were later used extensively as the drug [[Etanercept]] in the treatment of [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[Crohn's disease]], [[psoriasis]], and other forms of inflammation.

Interested in the mechanism by which LPS activates mammalian immune cells, Beutler used TNF production as a phenotypic endpoint to identify the LPS receptor. Identification of the receptor hinged on the [[positional cloning]] of the mammalian ''Lps'' locus, which had been known since the 1960s as a key genetic determinant of all biological responses to LPS.<ref>Sultzer, B.M. Genetic control of leucocyte responses to endotoxin. Nature 219(5160):1253-4, 1968</ref> Beutler thus discovered the key sensors of microbial infection in mammals, demonstrating that one of the mammalian [[Toll-like receptors]], TLR4, acts as the membrane-spanning component of the mammalian LPS receptor complex.<ref>Poltorak, A., et al. Defective LPS signaling in C3H/HeJ and C57BL/10ScCr mice: mutations in Tlr4 gene. Science 282(5396):2085-8, 1998</ref> The TLRs (of which ten are now known to exist in humans) are now widely known to function in the perception of microbes, each detecting signature molecules that herald infection. These receptors also mediate severe illness, including shock and systemic inflammation as it occurs in the course of an infection. They are central to the pathogenesis of sterile inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as [[systemic lupus erythematosus]].<ref>Christensen, S.R., et al. Toll-like receptor 7 and TLR9 dictate autoantibody specificity and have opposing inflammatory and regulatory roles in a murine model of lupus. Immunity 25(3):417-28, 2006</ref> The research on TLRs won him the Nobel Prize in 2011.[[File:Nobel Prize 2011-Press Conference KI-DSC 7568.jpg|thumb|[[Jules A. Hoffmann]] (background) and Beutler]]The positional cloning of ''Lps'' was completed in 1998. Beutler thereafter continued to apply a forward genetic approach to the analysis of immunity in mammals. In this process, germline mutations that alter immune function are created through a random process using the alkylating agent [[ENU]], detected by their phenotypic effects, and then isolated by positional cloning. His work disclosed numerous essential signaling molecules required for the innate immune response,<ref>Hoebe, K., et al. Identification of Lps2 as a key transducer of MyD88-independent TIR signalling. Nature 424(6950):743-8, 2003</ref><ref>Hoebe, K., et al. CD36 is a sensor of diacylglycerides.

Nature Immunol. 7(2):156-64, 2006</ref> and helped to delineate the biochemistry of innate immunity.

ENU mutagenesis was also used by Beutler and colleagues to study the global response to a defined infectious agent. By screening mutant mice for susceptibility to mouse [[cytomegalovirus]] (MCMV), they identified a large number of genes that make a life-or-death difference during infection, and termed this set of genes the MCMV "resistome".<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Beutler | first1 = B. | last2 = Crozat | first2 = K. | last3 = Koziol | first3 = J.

For example, [[KCNJ8|K<sub>ir</sub>6.1]] [[ATP-sensitive potassium channel]]s in the [[smooth muscle]] of the [[Coronary circulation|coronary arteries]] serve an essential homeostatic role during infection by this microbe, and mutations that affect them cause sudden death during infection.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Croker | first1 = B. | last2 = Crozat | first2 = K. | last3 = Berger | first3 = M. | last4 = Xia | first4 = Y. | last5 = Sovath | first5 = S. | last6 = Schaffer | first6 = L. | last7 = Eleftherianos | first7 = I. | last8 = Imler | first8 = J.
