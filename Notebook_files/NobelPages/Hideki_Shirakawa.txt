{{Nihongo|'''Hideki Shirakawa'''|白川 英樹|Shirakawa Hideki|born August 20, 1936}} is a Japanese [[chemist]], [[engineer]], and [[Professor Emeritus]] at the [[University of Tsukuba]] and [[Zhejiang University]]. He is best known for his discovery of [[conductive polymers]]. He was co-recipient of the 2000 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] jointly with [[Alan MacDiarmid]] and [[Alan Heeger]].

== Early life and education ==
[[File:Hideki Shirakawa and Yoshiro Mori 20001018.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Shirakawa with [[Yoshirō Mori]] (at the [[Prime Minister's Official Residence]] on October 18, 2000)]]
Hideki Shirakawa was born in [[Tokyo, Japan]], in the family of a military doctor. He lived in [[Manchukuo]] and [[Taiwan]] during childhood. Around third grade, he moved to [[Takayama, Gifu]], which is the hometown of his mother.

Shirakawa graduated from [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]] (Tokyo Tech) with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering in 1961, and his doctorate in 1966. Afterward, he obtained the post of assistant in Chemical Resources Laboratory at Tokyo Tech.

== Career ==
[[File:Emperor Akihito Yoshiro Mori and Hideki Shirakawa 20001103.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Emperor Akihito]] conferred the [[Order of Culture]] on Shirakawa (at the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace|Imperial Palace]] on November 3, 2000)]]
While employed as an assistant at [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]] (Tokyo Tech) in Japan, Shirakawa developed [[polyacetylene]], which has a metallic appearance. This result interested [[Alan MacDiarmid]] when MacDiarmid visited Tokyo Tech in 1975.

In 1976, he was invited to work in the laboratory of [[Alan MacDiarmid]] as a [[post-doctoral fellow]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. The two developed the [[electrical conductivity]] of polyacetylene along with American physicist [[Alan Heeger]].<ref name="HMacSh">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1039/C39770000578|title=Synthesis of electrically conducting organic polymers: Halogen derivatives of polyacetylene, (CH) x|year=1977|last1=Shirakawa|first1=Hideki|last2=Louis|first2=Edwin J.|last3=MacDiarmid|first3=Alan G.|last4=Chiang|first4=Chwan K.|last5=Heeger|first5=Alan J.|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Chemical Communications|issue=16|pages=578|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA041866}}</ref><ref name="nob">{{cite web | url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2000/ | title = The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2000: Alan Heeger, Alan G. MacDiarmid, Hideki Shirakawa}}</ref>

In 1977 they discovered that doping with [[iodine]] vapor could enhance the conductivity of polyacetylene. The three scientists were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2000 in recognition of the discovery. With regard to the mechanism of electric conduction, it is strongly believed that nonlinear [[Excited state|excitations]] in the form of [[solitons]] play a role.

In 1979, Shirakawa became an assistant professor in the [[University of Tsukuba]]; three years later, he advanced to a full professor. In 1991 he was appointed as Tsukuba's Chief of Science and Engineering Department of Graduate School (until March, 1993), and as Tsukuba's Chief of Category #3 group (until March, 1997).

== The Nobel Prize ==
Shirakawa awarded the 2000 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] together with [[University of Pennsylvania|UPenn]]'s physics professor [[Alan J. Heeger]] and chemistry professor [[Alan MacDiarmid|Alan G. MacDiarmid]], "for the discovery and development of conductive polymers".<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2000/ The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2000]</ref> He also became the first non-[[National Seven Universities]] graduate of [[List of Japanese Nobel laureates|Japanese Nobel laureates]], and second Japanese [[List of Nobel laureates in Chemistry|chemistry Nobel laureates]].

Over the years, Shirakawa has been expressed that he doesn't want the [[Nobel Prizes]] to receive too much special treatment from mass media (especially the [[Media of Japan|Japanese media]]). He hopes that many vital areas in fields outside the Nobel Prize categories will also become more widely known.<ref>[https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2016/10/16/national/science-health/shirakawa-unhappy-way-japanese-media-reports-nobel-issues/#.WciWsbIjGJA Shirakawa unhappy with way Japanese media reports Nobel issues | The Japan Times]</ref>

== Relatives ==
One of his relatives, [[Hitomi Yoshizawa]], is a member of the singing group [[Morning Musume]] ''Morning Girls''. He is also related to [[Naoko Takahashi]], the women's marathon gold medalist of the [[2000 Summer Olympics]].

== Public issues ==
On 6 December 2013, the [[House of Councillors (Japan)]] approved the bill of the [[State Secrecy Law]]. Shirakawa and physics Nobel laureate [[Toshihide Maskawa]] issued a statement saying that the law:
<blockquote>
"threatens the pacifist principles and fundamental human rights established by the constitution and should be rejected immediately''...(omitted)...''Even in difficult times, protecting the freedom of the press, of thought and expression and of academic research is indispensable.<ref>[http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/12/updated-over-scientists-objections-japan-adopts-state-secrets-law Updated: Over Scientists' Objections, Japan Adopts State Secrets Law | Science | AAAS]</ref>"
