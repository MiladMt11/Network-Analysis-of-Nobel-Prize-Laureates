'''John Hume''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of St. Gregory the Great|KCSG]]}} (18 January 1937{{spnd}}3 August 2020) was an [[Irish Nationalism|Irish nationalist]]<!--Please discuss any change on talkpage--> politician from [[Northern Ireland]], widely regarded as one of the most important figures in the recent political history of Ireland, as one of the architects of the [[Northern Ireland peace process]].

A native of [[Derry]], he was a founding member of the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP), and served as its second leader from 1979 to 2001. He also served as a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP), and a [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of the UK Parliament]] (MP), as well as a member of the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] (MLA).

Hume was co-recipient of the 1998 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] with [[David Trimble, Baron Trimble|David Trimble]], and also received both the [[Gandhi Peace Prize]] and the [[King Center for Nonviolent Social Change|Martin Luther King Award]].  He is the only person to receive the three major peace awards.

In 2012, Pope [[Benedict XVI]] made Hume a Knight Commander of the Papal [[Order of St. Gregory the Great]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-foyle-west-18733621 | work=BBC News | title=John Hume knighted by Pope Benedict | date=6 July 2012 | access-date=20 June 2018 | archive-date=21 October 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181021143154/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-foyle-west-18733621 | url-status=live }}</ref>

==Early life and education==

Hume was born in 1937 in Derry, the son of Anne (née Doherty) and Samuel Hume.<ref>{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=92bJlWbPeKMC&q=John+Hume+Anne+Doherty|title = Who's who in the World|isbn = 9780837911106|author1 = Marquis|year = 1990|access-date = 19 September 2020|archive-date = 23 September 2021|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210923144853/https://books.google.com/books?id=92bJlWbPeKMC&q=John+Hume+Anne+Doherty|url-status = live}}</ref> He had a mostly Irish Catholic background; though his great-grandfather was a Presbyterian immigrant into [[County Donegal]] from Scotland.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ceasefire: It's all just coming together for the fixer: John Hume risked all when he met Sinn Fein.

Among his teachers was the future [[Tomás Cardinal Ó Fiaich]], a future [[Primate of All Ireland]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ta2CAAAAIAAJ&q=%22john+hume%22+teacher+%22%C3%93+Fiaich%22|title=John Hume, Statesman of the Troubles|publisher=Blackstaff Press|year=1984|last=White|first=Barry|page=29|isbn=9780856403279|access-date=19 September 2020|archive-date=23 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210923144852/https://books.google.com/books?id=ta2CAAAAIAAJ&q=%22john+hume%22+teacher+%22%C3%93+Fiaich%22|url-status=live}}</ref>

Hume did not complete his clerical studies but did obtain an M.A. degree in French and history from the college in 1958, and then returned home to his native Derry, where he became a teacher. He was a founding member of the [[Credit Union]] movement in the city and was chair of the [[University for Derry Committee]] in 1965, an unsuccessful fight to have Northern Ireland's second university established in Derry in the mid-1960s.<ref>Gerald McSheffrey, ''Planning Derry: Planning and Politics in Northern Ireland'', p. 110.</ref> 

Hume became the youngest ever President of the [[Irish League of Credit Unions]] at age 27. He served in the role from 1964 to 1968. He once said that "all the things I've been doing, it's the thing I'm proudest of because no movement has done more good for the people of Ireland, north and south, than the credit union movement."<ref>{{cite web|title=John Hume Biography and Interview|website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|date=8 June 2002|url=https://www.achievement.org/achiever/john-hume/#interview|access-date=3 April 2019|archive-date=26 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190226154238/http://www.achievement.org/achiever/john-hume/#interview|url-status=live}}</ref>

Hume became a leading figure in the [[civil rights movements|civil rights movement]] in the late 1960s along with people such as [[Hugh Logue]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NJk7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT44|title=John Hume in America: From Londonderry to DC|publisher=Merrion Press|date=8 November 2017|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Maurice|page=44|isbn=9781911024989|access-date=19 September 2020|archive-date=23 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210923144852/https://books.google.com/books?id=NJk7DwAAQBAJ&pg=PT44|url-status=live}}</ref> Hume was a prominent figure in the Derry Citizens' Action Committee. The DCAC was set up in the wake of 5 October 1968 march through Derry which had caused much attention to be drawn towards the situation in Northern Ireland. The purpose of the DCAC was to make use of the publicity surrounding recent events to bring to light grievances in Derry that had been suppressed by the Unionist Government for years. The DCAC, unlike [[Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association]] (NICRA), was aimed specifically at a local campaign, improving the situation in Derry for everyone, and maintaining a peaceful stance.<ref>{{cite news|title=John Hume of DCAC|url=https://www.rte.ie/archives/exhibitions/1031-civil-rights-movement-1968-9/1036-protests-escalate/319546-john-hume-of-dcac/|access-date=3 August 2020|publisher=Raidió Teilifís Éireann|archive-date=13 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200813084947/https://www.rte.ie/archives/exhibitions/1031-civil-rights-movement-1968-9/1036-protests-escalate/319546-john-hume-of-dcac/|url-status=live}}</ref>  The committee also had a Stewards Association that was there to prevent any violence at marches or sit-downs.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QoAyqf7o0N8C|title=John Hume: A Biography|publisher=HarperCollinsPublishers|year=1998|last=Routledge|first=Paul|isbn=9780006387398|access-date=19 September 2020|archive-date=23 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210923144911/https://books.google.com/books?id=QoAyqf7o0N8C|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Political career==
[[File:President Clinton and SDLP leader John Hume.jpg|thumb|right|Hume with US president [[Bill Clinton]] in 1995]]
Hume became an [[Independent Nationalist]] member of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] in 1969 at the height of the [[civil rights]] campaign. He was elected to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly (1973)|Northern Ireland Assembly]] in 1973, and served as Minister of Commerce in the short-lived power-sharing [[Executive of the 1974 Northern Ireland Assembly|Executive]] in 1974.<ref name=Nobel>{{cite web|title=John Hume – Biographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1998/hume/biographical/|access-date=3 August 2020|publisher=Nobel Prize|archive-date=3 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803095809/https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1998/hume/biographical/|url-status=live}}</ref> He stood unsuccessfully for the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Westminster Parliament]] for the [[Londonderry (UK Parliament constituency)|Londonderry]] constituency in [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974]], and was elected for [[Foyle (UK Parliament constituency)|Foyle]] in [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Parliamentary career for Mr John Hume|url=https://members.parliament.uk/member/649/career|access-date=3 August 2020|publisher=Parliament of the United Kingdom|archive-date=7 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200807020713/https://members.parliament.uk/member/649/career|url-status=live}}</ref>

In October 1971 he joined four Westminster MPs in a 48-hour [[hunger strike]] to protest at the [[internment]] without trial of hundreds of suspected [[Irish republican]]s. State papers that have been released under the 30 year rule that an Irish diplomat eight years later in 1979 believed Hume supported the return of internment.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/breaking-news/uk-ireland/top-diplomat-thought-hume-wanted-return-of-internment-14616414.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120720035516/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/breaking-news/uk-ireland/top-diplomat-thought-hume-wanted-return-of-internment-14616414.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=20 July 2012 |title=Top diplomat thought Hume wanted return of internment }}</ref>

In 1977, Hume challenged a regulation under the [[Civil Authorities (Special Powers) Act (Northern Ireland) 1922]] which allowed any soldier to disperse an assembly of three or more people. The [[Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland]], [[Robert Lynd Erskine Lowry|Lord Lowry]], held that the regulation was ''[[ultra vires]]'' under Section 4 of the [[Government of Ireland Act 1920]] which forbade the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] to make laws in respect of the army.<ref>''Robert Lynd Erskine Lowry; '''ODNB'''''</ref>

A founding member of the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP), he succeeded [[Gerry Fitt]] as its leader in 1979.<ref>{{cite news|title=A mover and shaper who has made history|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/a-mover-and-shaper-who-has-made-history-1.141218|date=11 April 1998|access-date=3 August 2020|newspaper=The Irish Times|location=Dublin|archive-date=30 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201030072940/https://www.irishtimes.com/news/a-mover-and-shaper-who-has-made-history-1.141218|url-status=live}}</ref>  He also served as one of Northern Ireland's three [[Members of the European Parliament]] and served on the faculty of [[Boston College]], from which he received an honorary degree in 1995.<ref name="Boston College">{{cite news|title=John Hume: Vision and legacy|url=https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/bcnews/nation-world-society/international/tribute-to-john-hume.html|date=27 April 2018|access-date=3 August 2020|publisher=Boston College|archive-date=30 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201030072508/https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/bcnews/nation-world-society/international/tribute-to-john-hume.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

The vast majority of [[Unionism (Ireland)|unionists]] rejected the agreement and staged a massive and peaceful public rally in [[Belfast]] City Centre to demonstrate their distaste. Many Republicans and nationalists also rejected it, as they had seen it as not going far enough.<ref>Jonathan Tonge (2002). ''Northern Ireland: Conflict and Change''.</ref> Hume, however, continued dialogue with both governments and Sinn Féin. The "Hume–[[Gerry Adams|Adams]] process" eventually delivered the 1994 IRA ceasefire which ultimately provided the relatively peaceful backdrop against which the [[Good Friday agreement]] was brokered.<ref name="BBC obit"/>

==Reputation==
Hume is credited as being the thinker behind many political developments in [[Northern Ireland]], from the power-sharing [[Sunningdale Agreement]] to the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]] and the [[Belfast Agreement]].{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} He won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1998 alongside the then-leader of the [[Ulster Unionist Party]], [[David Trimble]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1998/summary/|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1998|website=NobelPrize.org|access-date=23 March 2019|archive-date=22 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200522013700/https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1998/summary/|url-status=live}}</ref>

When [[David Trimble]] became [[First Minister and deputy First Minister of Northern Ireland|First Minister]], it was expected that Hume would take the role of Deputy First Minister, being the leader of the second largest party, the SDLP. Instead, this role was handed to [[Seamus Mallon|Séamus Mallon]], also of the SDLP. Some political journalists cited a bad working relationship between Hume and Trimble, despite the two men collecting the Nobel Prize together.<!-- blacklisted website <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.readabstracts.com/Business-international/From-process-to-procession-Calling-John-Hume.html|title=From process to procession.
