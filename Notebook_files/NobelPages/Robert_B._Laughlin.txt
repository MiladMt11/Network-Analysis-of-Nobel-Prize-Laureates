'''Robert Betts Laughlin''' (born November&nbsp;1, 1950) is the Anne T. and [[Robert Bass (businessman)|Robert M. Bass]] Professor of [[Physics]] and [[Applied Physics]] at [[Stanford University]].<ref>[https://physics.stanford.edu/people/robert-laughlin Robert Laughlin – Stanford Physics Faculty]. Stanford.edu. Retrieved on 2012-01-28.</ref> Along with [[Horst L. Störmer]] of [[Columbia University]] and [[Daniel C. Tsui]] of [[Princeton University]], he was awarded a share of the 1998 [[Nobel Prize]] in [[physics]] for their explanation of the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]].

In 1983, Laughlin was first to provide a [[many-body physics|many body]] [[wave function]], now known as the ''[[Laughlin wavefunction]],'' for the [[fractional quantum hall effect]], which was able to correctly explain the fractionalized charge observed in experiments. This state has since been interpreted as the integer quantum Hall effect of the [[composite fermion]].<ref name=Jaincf>{{cite journal |author=J.K.

==Biography==
Laughlin was born in [[Visalia, California]]. He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[mathematics]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1972, and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in physics in 1979 at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT). Between 2004 and 2006 <ref>http://www.koreafocus.or.kr/design2/layout/content_print.asp?group_id=101176</ref>  he served as the president of [[KAIST]] in [[Daejeon]], [[South Korea]].

==View on climate change==
{{excessive quotation|date=August 2021}}
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2021}}
Laughlin's view of climate change is that it may be important, but that the future is impossible to change.

=== The climatic/geologic recovery process ===
"On the scales of time relevant to itself, the earth doesn’t care about any of these governments or their legislation. It doesn’t care whether you turn off your air conditioner, refrigerator, and television set..The earth plans to dissolve the bulk of this carbon dioxide into its oceans in about a millennium, leaving the concentration in the atmosphere slightly higher than today’s. Over tens of millennia after that, or perhaps hundreds, it will then slowly transfer the excess carbon dioxide into its rocks, eventually returning levels in the sea and air to what they were before humans arrived on the scene. The process will take an eternity from the human perspective, but it will be only a brief instant of geologic time".

=== Any effort to slow the rate of [[fossil fuel]] usage ===
"leave[s] the end result exactly the same: all the fossil fuel that used to be in the ground is now in the air, and none is left to burn"

=== The energy future ===
"The geologic record as we know it thus suggests that climate is a profoundly grander thing than energy. Energy procurement is a matter of engineering and keeping the lights on under circumstances that are likely to get more difficult as time progresses. Climate change, by contrast, is a matter of geologic time, something that the earth routinely does on its own without asking anyone’s permission or explaining itself... Far from being responsible for damaging the earth’s climate, civilization might not be able to forestall any of these terrible changes once the earth has decided to make them... The geologic record suggests that climate ought not to concern us too much when we’re gazing into the energy future, not because it’s unimportant, but because it’s beyond our power to control.."<ref>[http://www.theamericanscholar.org/what-the-earth-knows/ "What the Earth Knows" – Robert B.

== Publications ==
[[File:Clinton&1998NobelLaureates.jpg|thumb|300px|Laughlin (right) in the White House together with other 1998 US Nobel Prize Winners and the President [[Bill Clinton]]]]
Laughlin published a book entitled ''[[A Different Universe: Reinventing Physics from the Bottom Down]]'' in 2005. The book argues for [[emergence]] as a replacement for [[reductionism]], in addition to general commentary on hot-topic issues.
