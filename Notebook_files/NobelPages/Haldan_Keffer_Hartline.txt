==Education==
Hartline did his undergraduate studies at [[Lafayette College]] in Easton, Pennsylvania, graduating in 1923. He began his study of retinal electrophysiology as a National Research Council Fellow at [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]], receiving his medical degree in 1927.{{fact|date=March 2016}}

==Career and research==
After attending the universities of [[University of Leipzig|Leipzig]] and [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|Munich]] as an Eldridge Johnson traveling research scholar from the [[University of Pennsylvania]], he returned to the US to take a position in the Eldridge Reeves Johnson Foundation for Medical Physics at Penn, which was under the directorship of [[Detlev Bronk|Detlev W. Bronk]] at that time. In 1940–1941, he was Associate Professor of Physiology at Cornell Medical College in New York City, but returned to Penn and stayed until 1949. Then he became professor of [[biophysics]] and chairman of the department at [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]] in 1949. One of Hartline's graduate students at [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]], [[Paul Greengard]], who also won the Nobel Prize. Hartline joined the staff of [[Rockefeller University]], New York City, in 1953 as professor of neurophysiology.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Hartline investigated the electrical responses of the [[retina]]s of certain [[arthropod]]s, [[vertebrate]]s, and [[mollusk]]s, because their [[visual system]]s are much simpler than those of humans and thus easier to study. He concentrated his studies on the eye of the [[horseshoe crab]] (''[[Atlantic horseshoe crab|Limulus polyphemus]]''). Using minute electrodes, he obtained the first record of the electrical impulses sent by a single [[optic nerve]] fibre when the receptors connected to it are stimulated by light. He found that the [[photoreceptor cell]]s in the eye are interconnected in such a way that when one is stimulated, others [[lateral inhibition|nearby are depressed]], thus enhancing the contrast in light patterns and sharpening the perception of shapes. Hartline thus built up a detailed understanding of the workings of individual photoreceptors and nerve fibres in the retina, and he showed how simple retinal mechanisms constitute vital steps in the integration of visual information.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Awards and honors==
Hartline was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1966|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1966]].<ref name="frs1985"/> He was awarded the  [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]  in 1967.<ref>{{Nobelprize|name=Keffer Hartline|accessdate=2020-10-12}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/hartline-haldan.pdf National Academy of Sciences Biographical Memoir: Haldane Keefer Hartline 1903—1983 A Biographical Memoir by Floyd Ratliff]</ref>

== Personal life ==
Hartline married [[Elizabeth K. Hartline|Elizabeth Kraus Hartline]] in 1936.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Rasmussen|first=Frederick N.|title=Elizabeth K.
