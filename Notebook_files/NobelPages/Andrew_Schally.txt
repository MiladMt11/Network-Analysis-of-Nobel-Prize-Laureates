'''Andrzej Viktor''' "'''Andrew'''" '''Schally''' (born 30 November 1926) is an American endocrinologist<ref name="Brit">Andrew V. Schally, [https://www.britannica.com/biography/Andrew-Schally "Andrew V. Schally"], ''Encyclopædia Britannica''.</ref> of [[Polish Americans|Polish]]<ref name="Brit"/><ref name="Schally"/><ref name="Victor"/> ancestry, who was a corecipient, with [[Roger Guillemin]] and [[Rosalyn Sussman Yalow]], of the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].<ref name="Schally"/> This award recognized his research in the discovery that the hypothalamus controls hormone production and release by the pituitary gland, which controls the regulation of other hormones in the body. <ref>{{Cite web |url=https://mcgillnews.mcgill.ca/s/1762/news/interior.aspx?sid=1762&gid=2&pgid=2319|title = Nobel laureate not one to rest on his laurels}}</ref>Later in life Schally utilized his knowledge of hypothalamic hormones to research possible methods for birth control and cancer treatment. 

==Life and career==
Schally was born in [[Wilno]], [[Second Polish Republic]]<ref name="Brit"/><ref name="Schally"/><ref name="Victor"/> (since 1945 [[Vilnius]], [[USSR]]), as the son of Gen. [[Brigadier]] [[Kazimierz Schally]], who was Chief of the Cabinet of President [[Ignacy Mościcki]] of Poland, and Maria (Łącka).

In September 1939, when Poland was attacked by [[Nazi Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]], Schally escaped with Poland's President [[Ignacy Mościcki]], Prime Minister and the whole cabinet to the neutral Romania, where they were interned.
<blockquote>I was fortunate to survive the holocaust while living among the Jewish-Polish Community in Roumania. I used to speak Polish, Roumanian, Yiddish, Italian and some German and Russian, but I have almost completely forgotten them, and my French in which I used to excel is also now far from fluent.<ref name="Schally">[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1977/schally-autobio.html?print=1 Andrew Schally: Autobiography]</ref></blockquote>

Immediately after the war, in 1945, he moved via Italy and France to the United Kingdom. Schally received his education in Scotland and England. In 1952, he moved to Canada. He received his doctorate in [[endocrinology]] from [[McGill University]] in 1957. That same year he left for a research career in the United States where he has worked principally at [[Tulane University]]. Schally currently conducts research in Endocrinology at the Miami Veteran's Administration Medical Center in Miami, Fl. A Canadian citizen when he left Canada, Schally became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States in 1962. He was affiliated with the [[Baylor College of Medicine]] for some years in Houston, Texas.<ref name="Schally"/>

He developed a new realm of knowledge concerning the brain's control over the body chemistry. Schally explained in his 1977 Nobel Lecture that he, alongside his researchers, dissected 250,000 pig hypothalami in order to isolate 5 mg of the hormone thyrotropin-releasing hormone ([[Thyrotropin-releasing hormone|TRH]]) to determine the molecular structure of the hormone.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Schally|first=Andrew|date=December 8, 1977|title=ASPECTS OF HYPOTHALAMIC REGULATION OF THE PITUITARY GLAND WITH MAJOR EMPHASIS ON ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE CONTROL OF REPRODUCTIVE PROCESSES|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/schally-lecture.pdf|url-status=live|access-date=April 11, 2021|website=The Nobel Prize}}</ref> His work also addressed birth control methods and the effects of [[Growth hormone|growth hormones]] on the body. Together with [[Roger Guillemin]] he described the [[neurohormone]] gonadotropin-releasing hormone ([[GnRH]]) that controls follicle-stimulating hormone [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|(FSH)]] and luteinizing hormone ([[Luteinizing hormone|LH)]], two hormones that are integral parts of reproduction and growth and development.

Schally received an ''honoris causa'' Doctors degree from the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]].

Recognized as a Fellow of the [[Kosciuszko Foundation]] of Eminent Scientists of Polish Origin and Ancestry.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thekf.org/kf/programs/eminentscientists/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2017-09-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509145002/https://www.thekf.org/kf/programs/eminentscientists/ |archive-date=2018-05-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

He was married to Margaret Rachel White (divorced), and Ana Maria de Medeiros-Comaru.<ref name="Victor">{{Cite web | url=http://www.faqs.org/health/bios/19/Andrew-V-Schally.html |title = Andrew V. Schally Biography (1926-)}}</ref>

== Cancer research ==
In 1981 it was demonstrated that GnRH agonistic analogs that Schally had developed between the years of 1972-1978 inhibited the growth of prostate cancer in rats. Alongside Dr. George Tolis, Schally organized the first clinical trial with agonistic analogs of [[Gonadotropin-releasing hormone|GnRH]] for patients with advanced [[prostate cancer]] in 1982. This method is now the preferred method for treatment for advanced prostate carcinoma, about 70% of patients with prostate cancer utilize a GnRH agonist for their primary method of treatment.<ref name=":0" /> The previous method of treatment was based off the research of [[Charles Brenton Huggins|Charles Huggins]], where the most common treatment for advanced prostate cancer was an [[orchiectomy]] or the administration of estrogens.

In 2004 after the death of his wife due to [[thyroid cancer]], Schally reports finding comfort in continuing his research on cancer treatment. According to Schally, his discovered methods of treatment for cancer yield less side affects on the patient due to them being analogs of hypothalamic hormones, in contrast to radiation and [[chemotherapy]].<ref name=":0" />
