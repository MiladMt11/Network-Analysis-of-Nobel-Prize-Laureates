=== The Hague Conference on Private International Law ===
Asser was a leading legal mind in the area of private international law and firmly believed that sound legal frameworks that govern private cross-border relationships would promote peace and stability. In 1893, Asser initiated the convocation of the First Diplomatic Session of the HCCH, the preeminent global organisation in the area of [[private international law]]. The participating States were Austria-Hungary, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, Russia, Spain, and Switzerland. Asser was elected the Session's President, and subsequently re-elected at the Second to Fourth Session which took place in 1894, 1900 and 1904 respectively. Under his leadership, the HCCH developed a number of multilateral treaties, the Hague Conventions, that unified the rules of private international law in the areas of [https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/the-old-conventions/1902-marriage-convention Marriage (1902)], [https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/the-old-conventions/1902-divorce-convention Divorce (1902)], [https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/the-old-conventions/1902-guardianship-convention Guardianship (1902)], [https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/the-old-conventions/1905-civil-procedure-convention Civil Procedure (1905)], [https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/the-old-conventions/1905-effects-of-marriage-convention Effects of Marriage (1905)], and [https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/the-old-conventions/1905-deprivation-of-civil-rights-convention Deprivation of Civil Rights (1905)].

In 1911, Asser received the [[Nobel Prize for Peace]]. In his Award Ceremony Speech on 10 December 1911, Chairman of the Nobel Committee [[Jørgen Løvland|Jørgen Gunnarsson Løvland]] emphasised specifically Asser's work in the field of private international law, and his achievements establishing the HCCH, as reasons for receiving the Nobel Peace Prize, describing Asser as "a successor to or reviver of The Netherlands' pioneer work in international law in the seventeenth century", the [[Hugo Grotius]] of his time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1911/asser-facts.html|title=Tobias Asser - Facts|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-11-03}}</ref>

=== The Hague Peace Conferences ===
He was a delegate of the Netherlands to both Hague Peace Conferences in 1899 and 1907.<ref name="AJILMem" />

=== The Permanent Court of Arbitration ===
In 1902, he sat on the first arbitration panel to hear an international controversy brought by two states under the auspice of the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]], which was established as a result of the [[Hague Peace Conference]] of 1899 (the [[Pious Fund of the Californias]] Case).  He also took a hand in the establishment of what would become [[The Hague Academy of International Law]], though he did not live to see its foundation in 1923.<ref name="AJILMem" />

Asser died on 29 July 1913 in The Hague.
