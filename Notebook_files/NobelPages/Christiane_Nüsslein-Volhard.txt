==Early life and education==
Nüsslein-Volhard was born in [[Magdeburg]] on 20 October 1942, the second of five children to Rolf Volhard, an architect, and Brigitte Haas Volhard, a nursery school teacher.<ref name="WIB">{{Cite web |last=Lara Marks |title=A biography of Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard |url=http://www.whatisbiotechnology.org/index.php/people/summary/Nusslein-Volhard |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327214708/http://www.whatisbiotechnology.org/index.php/people/summary/Nusslein-Volhard |archive-date=2018-03-27 |publication-date=February 2018 }}</ref> She has four siblings: three sisters and one brother.

Her great-grandfather was the chemist [[Jacob Volhard]], her grandfather the known internist [[Franz Volhard]]. She is the aunt of the Nobel laureate in chemistry [[Benjamin List]].<ref name=tagblatt>{{cite news |title=Nobelpreis für Nüsslein-Volhards Neffen |url=https://www.tagblatt.de/Nachrichten/Nobelpreis-fuer-Nuesslein-Volhards-Neffen-519710.html|newspaper=Tagblatt.de |access-date=6 October 2021}}</ref>

After the Abitur in 1962, she briefly considered pursuing medicine, but dropped the idea after doing a month’s nursing course in a hospital. Instead she followed her genuine interest and opted to study biology at [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University]] in Frankfurt.<ref name="WIB"/> In 1964 Nüsslein-Volhard left Frankfurt for the [[University of Tübingen]], to start a new course in biochemistry. She originally wanted to do [[behavioral biology]], "but then somehow I ended up in biochemistry (...) and molecular genetics because at the time this was the most modern aspect, and I was ambitious — I wanted to go where the leaders were. The old-fashioned botanists and zoologists were such dull people— there was nothing interesting there."<ref name="cell press" /> 

She received a diploma in biochemistry in 1969<ref name="WIB"/> and earned a [[PhD]] in 1974 for research into [[Protein–DNA interaction]]s and the binding of [[RNA polymerase]] in ''[[Escherichia coli]]''.<ref name=nusselnphd>{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Christiane |last=Nüsslein-Volhard |title=Zur spezifischen Protein-Nukleinsäure-Wechselwirkung : die Bindung von RNS-Polymerase aus Escherichia coli an die Replikative-Form-DNS des Bakteriophagen fd und die Charakterisierung der Bindungsstellen |publisher=University of Tübingen |date=1974 |oclc=793770536}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1995/nusslein-volhard-lecture.html|title=Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard – Nobel Lecture: The Identification of Genes Controlling Development in Flies and Fishes|website=nobelprize.org}}</ref>

==Career==
In 1975 Nüsslein-Volhard became a postdoctoral researcher in [[Walter Gehring]]´s laboratory at the Biozentrum, the University of Basel, a specialist in the developmental biology of ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' (fruit fly) supported by a long-term fellowship from the [[European Molecular Biology Organization]] (EMBO).
In 1977, she continued in the laboratory of [[Klaus Sander]] at Freiburg University, who was an expert in embryonic patterning.
In 1978, she set up her own lab in the newly founded [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] in Heidelberg with [[Eric Wieschaus]], whom she had met in Basel. Over the next three years they examined about 20,000 mutated fly families, collected about 600 mutants with an altered body pattern and found that out of the about 5,000 essential genes only 120 were essential for early development. In October 1980, they published the mere 15 genes controlling the segmented pattern of the Drosophila larva.<ref name="WIB"/> 

In 1981, Nüsslein-Volhard moved to the [[Friedrich Miescher Laboratory of the Max Planck Society]] in Tübingen. 
From 1984 until her retirement in 2014, she was the Director of the [[Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology]] in Tübingen and also led its Genetics Department. After 1984 she launched work on the developmental biology of vertebrates, using the zebrafish ([[Danio rerio]]) as her research model.<ref name="WIB"/> 

In 2001, she became a member of the ''Nationaler Ethikrat'' (National Ethics Council of Germany) for the [[Ethics|ethical]] assessment of new developments in the [[life sciences]] and their influence on the individual and society. Her primer for the lay-reader, ''Coming to Life: How Genes Drive Development'', was published in April 2006.

In 2004, she started the Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard Foundation (''Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard Stiftung'') which aids promising young female German scientists with children. The foundation's main focus is to facilitate childcare as a supplement to existing stipends and day care.<ref name=":0" />
 
===Research===
{{cleanup|section|reason=copy edit needed, undue weight on Drosophila work, poor referencing|date=October 2021}}
During the late 1970s and early 1980s little was known about the genetic and molecular mechanisms by which multicellular organisms [[developmental biology|develop]] from single cells to morphologically complex forms during [[embryogenesis]]. Nüsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus identified genes involved in embryonic development by a series of  [[genetic screen]]s, generating random [[mutations]] in fruit flies using [[ethyl methanesulfonate]]. Some of these mutations affected genes involved in the development of the embryo. They took advantage of the [[Segmentation (biology)|segmented]] form of ''Drosophila'' larvae to address the logic of the genes controlling development. In normal unmutated ''Drosophila,'' each segment produces bristles called denticles in a band arranged on the side of the segment closer to the head (the [[Anatomical terms of location#Anterior and posterior|anterior]]). They looked at the pattern of segments and denticles in each mutant under the microscope, and were therefore able to work out that particular genes were involved in different processes during development based on their differing mutant phenotypes (such as fewer segments, gaps in the normal segment pattern, and alterations in the patterns of denticles on the segments).<ref>{{cite journal |author=Nüsslein-Volhard C, Wieschaus E |title=Mutations affecting segment number and polarity in Drosophila |journal=Nature |volume=287 |issue=5785 |pages=795–801 |date=October 1980 |pmid=6776413 |doi= 10.1038/287795a0|bibcode=1980Natur.287..795N |s2cid=4337658 }}</ref> Many of these genes were given descriptive names based on the appearance of the mutant larvae, such as [[Hedgehog signaling pathway|''hedgehog'']], ''[[gurken]]'' (German: "cucumbers"), and ''[[Krüppel]]'' ( "cripple"). Later, researchers{{who|date=October 2021}} identified exactly which gene had been affected by each mutation, thereby identifying a [[Drosophila embryogenesis|set of genes crucial for ''Drosophila'' embryogenesis]]. The subsequent study of these mutants and their interactions led to important new insights into early ''Drosophila'' development, especially the mechanisms that underlie the step-wise development of body segments.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

These experiments are not only distinguished by their sheer scale (with the methods available at the time, they involved an enormous workload), but more importantly by their significance for organisms other than fruit flies. It was later found{{when|date=October 2021}} that many of the genes identified had [[Homology (biology)|homologues]] in other species.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}} In particular, the [[homeobox]] genes (coding for [[transcription factors]] critically involved in early body development) are found in all [[metazoan]]s, and usually have similar roles in body [[Segmentation (biology)|segmentation]].{{cn|date=October 2021}}

Her findings led to important realizations about evolution – for example, that [[protostomes]] and [[deuterostomes]] are likely to have had a relatively well-developed common ancestor with a much more complex body plan than had been conventionally thought. Additionally, they greatly increased our understanding of the regulation of [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]], as well as cell fate during development.{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

Nüsslein-Volhard is associated with the discovery of ''[[Toll (gene)|Toll]]'', which led to the identification of [[toll-like receptor]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Toll To Be Paid at the Gateway to the Vessel Wall |journal=Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=1085–1087 |doi=10.1161/01.ATV.0000168894.43759.47 |pmid=15923538 |date=June 2005 |last1=Hansson |first1=G.
