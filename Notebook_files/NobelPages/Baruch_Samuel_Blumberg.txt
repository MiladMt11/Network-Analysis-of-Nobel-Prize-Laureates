(That school also had among its students a contemporary of Blumberg, [[Eric Kandel]], who is another recipient of the Nobel Prize in medicine.) Blumberg then attended Brooklyn's [[James Madison High School (Brooklyn)|James Madison High School]], a school that Blumberg described as having high academic standards, including many teachers with Ph.D.s.<ref>[http://www.webofstories.com/play/baruch.blumberg/1 Early life and school – Baruch Blumberg: Physician], [[Web of Stories]].

Originally entering the graduate program in mathematics at Columbia University, Blumberg switched to medicine and enrolled at Columbia's [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons|College of Physicians and Surgeons]], from which he received his [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] in 1951. He remained at [[Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center]] for the next four years, first as an intern and then as a resident. He then moved to the [[University of Oxford]] and began graduate work in biochemistry at [[Balliol College, Oxford]] and earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|DPhil]] there in 1957. He later became the first American to be [[List of Balliol College people#Masters of Balliol|master]] at [[Balliol College, Oxford]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Barry Blumberg |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18617858 |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |date=28 April 2011 |access-date=30 August 2012}}</ref>

===Scientific career===
[[File:Baruch Samuel Blumberg by Dominic Hart (NASA).jpg|thumb|left|1999 press conference at which Blumberg was introduced as the first director of the NASA Astrobiology Institute]]
Throughout the 1950s, Blumberg traveled the world taking human blood samples, to study the [[genetic variation]]s in human beings, focusing on the question of why some people contract a disease in a given environment, while others do not. In 1964, while studying "yellow jaundice" ([[hepatitis]]), he discovered a [[HBsAg|surface antigen]] for hepatitis B in the blood of an Australian aborigine, hence initially called the 'Australian antigen'.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Blumberg |first=B. S. |year=1964 |title=Polymorphisms of the serum proteins and the development of iso-preciptins in transfused patients |journal=Bull N Y Acad Med |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=377–386 |pmid=14146804 |pmc=1750599 }}</ref> His work later demonstrated that the virus could cause liver cancer.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/07/health/07blumberg.html| work = [[The New York Times]] | date = July 4, 2011| title = Blumberg}}</ref> Blumberg and his team were able to develop a screening test for the hepatitis B virus, to prevent its spread in blood donations, and developed a vaccine. Blumberg later freely distributed his vaccine patent in order to promote its distribution by drug companies. Deployment of the vaccine reduced the infection rate of hepatitis B in children in China from 15% to 1% in 10 years.<ref>{{cite news |work=[[The Economist]] |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18617858?story_id=18617858&CFID=163885233&CFTOKEN=77593797 |title=Obituary: Barry Blumberg |date=30 April 2011 |page=92 }}</ref>

In 1964, Blumberg became a member of the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) of the Lankenau Hospital Research Institute in Philadelphia, known today as the [[Lankenau Institute for Medical Research]] (LIMR), which later joined the [[Fox Chase Cancer Center]] in 1974, and he held the rank of University Professor of Medicine and Anthropology at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] starting in 1977. Concurrently, he was Master of [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol College]] from 1989 to 1994. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1994.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B |url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=6 April 2011}}</ref> From 1999 to 2002, he was also director of the [[NASA Astrobiology Institute]] at the [[Ames Research Center]] in Moffett Field, California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/1999/99-061.txt |title=Nobel Prize Winner To Lead NASA Astrobiology Institute ''NASA'' |access-date=2011-04-07| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110417032917/http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/1999/99-061.txt| archive-date= 17 April 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewnews.html?id=446 |title="Astrobiology at T+5 Years" ''Ad Astra Magazine/NSS'' |publisher=Spaceref.com |date=2002-05-09 |access-date=2011-04-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal

Beginning in 2005, Blumberg also served as the president of the [[American Philosophical Society]].

In October 2010, Blumberg participated in the [[USA Science and Engineering Festival]]'s Lunch with a Laureate program, in which middle and high school students of the Greater Washington D.C., Northern Virginia and Maryland area got to engage in an informal conversation with a Nobel Prize–winning scientist over a brown-bag lunch.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usasciencefestival.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=43&Itemid=76&limitstart=15 |title=USA Science and Engineering Festival – Affiliate Events |publisher=[[USA Science and Engineering Festival]] |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130416015020/http://www.usasciencefestival.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=43&Itemid=76&limitstart=15 |archive-date=April 16, 2013 |url-status=live |access-date=February 23, 2013 }}</ref>

In an interview with ''The New York Times'' in 2002 he stated that "[Saving lives] is what drew me to medicine. There is, in Jewish thought, this idea that if you save a single life, you save the whole world".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/07/health/07blumberg.html?_r=1&pagewanted=2|title=Baruch Blumberg, Who Discovered and Tackled Hepatitis B, Dies at 85|work=The New York Times|date=6 April 2011|access-date=7 April 2011|first=H.

In discussing the factors that influenced his life, Blumberg always gave credit to the mental discipline of the Jewish [[Talmud]], and as often as possible, he attended weekly Talmud discussion classes until his death.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.seti.org/page.aspx?pid=1593 |title=SETI Institute |publisher=Seti.org |access-date=2011-04-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517062141/http://www.seti.org/page.aspx?pid=1593 |archive-date=2011-05-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2011, the [[Library of Congress]] and [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) announced the establishment of the Baruch S. Blumberg NASA/Library of Congress Chair in Astrobiology, a research position housed within the library's [[John W. Kluge Center]], which explores the effects of [[astrobiology]] research on society. The chair was named for Blumberg in recognition of his service to the Library of Congress Scholars Council, and his commitment to "research and dialogue between disciplines."<ref>{{cite news
