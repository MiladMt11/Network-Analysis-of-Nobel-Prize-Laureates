===Black hole at the Galactic Center (Sgr A*)===
{{main|Sagittarius A*}}
By imaging the [[Galactic Center]] at [[infrared]] wavelengths, Ghez and her colleagues have been able to peer through heavy dust that blocks visible light, to reveal images of the center of the Milky Way. Thanks to the 10-meter aperture of the [[W. M. Keck Observatory|W.M. Keck Telescope]] and the use of [[adaptive optics]] to correct for the turbulence of the atmosphere, these images of the Galactic Center are at very high spatial resolution and have made it possible to follow the orbits of stars around the black hole Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). The partial orbits of many stars orbiting the black hole at the Galactic Center have been observed.  One of the stars, [[S2 (star)|S2]], has made a complete [[elliptical orbit]] since detailed observations began in 1995.  Several decades more will be required to completely document the orbits of some of these stars. These measurements may provide a test of the theory of [[general relativity]]. In October 2012, a second star, [[S0-102]], was identified by her team at UCLA, orbiting the Galactic Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/ucla-astronomers-discover-star-239172.aspx|title=UCLA astronomers discover star racing around black hole at center of our galaxy|first=Stuart|last=Wolpert|website=UCLA Newsroom|access-date=October 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140315054143/http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/ucla-astronomers-discover-star-239172.aspx|archive-date=March 15, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Using [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|Kepler's third law]], Ghez's team used the orbital motion to show that the mass of Sgr A* is 4.1±0.6&nbsp;million [[solar mass]]es.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Measuring Distance and Properties of the Milky Way's Central Supermassive Black Hole with Stellar Orbits|first1=A.
