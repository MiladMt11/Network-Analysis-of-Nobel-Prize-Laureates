'''Selman Abraham Waksman''' (July 22, 1888 – August 16, 1973) was a Russian Empire-born Jewish-American inventor, [[biochemist]] and [[microbiologist]] whose research into the [[decomposition]] of [[organism]]s that live in [[soil]] enabled the discovery of [[streptomycin]] and several other [[antibiotic]]s. A professor of biochemistry and microbiology at [[Rutgers University]] for four decades, he discovered a number of antibiotics (and introduced the modern sense of that word to name them), and he introduced procedures that have led to the development of many others. The proceeds earned from the licensing of his patents funded a foundation for microbiological research, which established the [[Waksman Institute of Microbiology]] located on the Rutgers University [[Busch Campus]] in [[Piscataway, New Jersey]] (USA). In 1952, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Physiology]] or [[Medicine]] for "ingenious, systematic and successful studies of the soil microbes that led to the discovery of streptomycin." Waksman and his foundation later were sued by [[Albert Schatz (scientist)|Albert Schatz]], one of his PhD students and first discoverer of streptomycin, for minimizing Schatz's role in the discovery of streptomycin.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kingston|first=William|date=2004-07-01|title=Streptomycin, Schatz v.

In 2005, Selman Waksman was granted an [[ACS National Historical Chemical Landmarks|ACS National Historical Chemical Landmark]] in recognition of the significant work of his lab in isolating more than 15 antibiotics, including streptomycin, which was the first effective treatment for [[tuberculosis]].<ref>{{cite web | title = Selman Waksman and Antibiotics | work = National Historic Chemical Landmarks | publisher = [[American Chemical Society]] | url = http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/selmanwaksman.html | access-date = 2014-02-21 }}</ref>

Waksman attended [[Rutgers University|Rutgers College]] (now Rutgers University), where he graduated in 1915 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] in agriculture. He continued his studies at Rutgers, receiving a [[Master of Science]] the following year. During his graduate study, he worked under [[J. G. Lipman]] at the [[School of Environmental and Biological Sciences (Rutgers University)|New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station]] at Rutgers performing research in soil bacteriology. Waksman spent some months in 1915-1916 at the. [[United States Department of Agriculture]] in [[Washington, DC]] under Dr [[Charles Thom]], studying soil fungi.<ref name="Ryan_1993">{{cite book | last = Ryan | first = Frank | year = 1993 | title = The forgotten plague: how the battle against tuberculosis was won—and lost | publisher = Little, Brown | location = Boston | isbn = 978-0316763806 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/forgottenplagueh00ryan }}</ref>{{rp|44–48}} He was then appointed as a research fellow at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], where he was awarded his [[doctor of philosophy]] in biochemistry in 1918.

Later he joined the faculty at [[Rutgers University]] in the Department of Biochemistry and Microbiology. At Rutgers, Waksman's team discovered several antibiotics, including [[actinomycin]], [[clavacin]], streptothricin, streptomycin, grisein, [[neomycin]], fradicin, [[candicidin]], candidin. Two of these, streptomycin and neomycin, have found extensive application in the treatment of infectious disease. Streptomycin was the first [[antibiotic]] that could be used to cure the disease tuberculosis. Waksman is credited with coining the term antibiotics, to describe [[antibacterial]]s derived from other living organisms, for example [[penicillin]], though the term was used by the French dermatologist [[François Henri Hallopeau]], in 1871 to describe a substance opposed to the development of life.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} Waksman took credit for Albert Schatz’s discovery of the first effective drug against gram negative bacteria.{{Citation needed|date=July 2021}} 

In addition to his task at Rutgers, Waksman organized a division of Marine Bacteriology at the [[Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution]] in 1931.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1952/waksman-bio.html|title=Selman A. Waksman - Biographical|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=November 8, 2019}}</ref> He was appointed as a marine bacteriologist there and served until 1942. He was elected a trustee at WHOI and finally a Life Trustee.

Waksman acquired many awards and honours, including the Nobel Prize in 1952; the Star of the Rising Sun allotted on him by the emperor of Japan, and the rank of ''Commandeur'' in the French [[Légion d'honneur]].<ref name="foundationhistory"/><ref>[<!--http://waksman.rutgers.edu/Waks/Waksman/DrWaksman.html-->{{cite web|url=http://waksman.rutgers.edu/Waks/Waksman/DrWaksman.html |title=Dr. Selman Waksman |publisher=The Waksman Institute at Rutgers website (No further authorship information available) |access-date=January 17, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418134324/http://waksman.rutgers.edu/Waks/Waksman/DrWaksman.html |archive-date=April 18, 2008 }}</ref>

Selman Waksman died on August 16, 1973, at a Hyannis, Mass. Hospital and was interred at the Woods Hole Village Cemetery in [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]]. His tombstone is inscribed "Selman Abraham Waksman: Scientist", with his dates of birth and death, and the term "The earth will unlock and fetch ahead salvation" in [[Hebrew]] and English, from {{bible|Isaiah|45:8}}.<ref name="foundationhistory"/><ref>This verse differs from the [[King James Version]], "Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the LORD have created it."</ref>

==Research==
===Streptomycin===
{{main article|Streptomycin}}
Waksman had been studying the [[Streptomyces]] family of organism since his college student days and had, for a time, been studying the organism ''[[Streptomyces griseus]]''. Streptomycin was isolated from ''S. griseus'' and found effective against [[tuberculosis]] by one of Waksman's graduate students, [[Albert Schatz (scientist)|Albert Schatz]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/2/63042d06-83c2-11e1-82ca-00144feab49a.html#axzz1s0Q17zi3 |title=Germ warfare |date=April 14, 2012 |publisher=[[Financial Times]] |author=Andrew Jack}}</ref>

====Controversy====
{{see also|Albert Schatz (scientist)#Streptomycin controversy}}
The details and credit for the discovery of streptomycin and its usefulness as an antibiotic were strongly contested by Schatz, eventually leading to litigation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.scc.rutgers.edu/njh/SciANDTech/Waksman/schatz.htm |title=The Schatz v.

Systematic experiments to test several strains of antibiotics against several different disease organisms were under way in Waksman's laboratory at the time. Their classic approach was to explore a complete matrix with rows consisting of antibiotics and columns consisting of different diseases. The bacteria which produced the antibiotic streptomycin were discovered by Schatz in the farmland outside his lab, and tested by him.<ref name=NYT/> Waksman, however, eventually came to claim sole credit for the discovery.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Neomycin===
{{Main article|Neomycin}}
Neomycin is derived from actinomycetes and was discovered by Waksman and Hubert A. Lechevalier, one of Waksman's graduate students. The discovery was published in the journal ''Science''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Waksman|first1=S. A.|last2=Lechevalier|first2=H.
