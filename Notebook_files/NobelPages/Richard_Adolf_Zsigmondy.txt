'''Richard Adolf Zsigmondy''' ({{lang-hu|Zsigmondy Richárd Adolf}}; 1 April 1865 – 23 September 1929) was an ethnic [[Hungarians in Austria|Hungarian]] [[chemist]] from [[Austria]]. He was known for his research in [[colloids]], for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in chemistry]] in 1925. The crater [[Zsigmondy (crater)|Zsigmondy]] on the Moon is named in his honour.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Zsigmondy was born in [[Vienna]], [[Austrian Empire]], to a [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] gentry family. His mother Irma Szakmáry, a poet born in [[Martonvásár]], and his father, [[Adolf Zsigmondy]] Sr., a scientist from [[Pressburg]] (Pozsony, today's [[Bratislava]]) who invented several surgical instruments for use in dentistry. Zsigmondy family members were Lutherans. They originated from Johannes ({{lang-hu|János}}) Sigmondi (1686–1746, [[Bártfa]],  [[Kingdom of Hungary]]) and included teachers, priests and Hungarian freedom-fighters. Richard was raised by his mother after his father's early death in 1880, and received a comprehensive education. He enjoyed hobbies such as [[climbing]] and [[mountaineering]] with his siblings. His elder brothers, [[Otto Zsigmondy|Otto]] (a dentist) and [[Emil Zsigmondy|Emil]] (a physician), were well-known mountain climbers; his younger brother, [[Karl Zsigmondy]], became a notable mathematician in Vienna. In high school Richard developed an interest in natural science, especially in chemistry and physics, and experimented in his home laboratory.

He began his academic career at the [[University of Vienna]] Medical Faculty, but soon moved to the [[Technical University of Vienna]], and later to the [[University of Munich]], to study chemistry under [[Wilhelm von Miller]] (1848–1899). In Munich he conducted research on [[indene]] and received his PhD in 1889.<ref>{{cite journal | title= Zur Synthese von Indenderivaten | author=    Miller, W.

===Career===
[[Image:ColloidalGold aq.png|100px|thumb|left|Aqueous [[colloidal gold]].]]
Zsigmondy left organic chemistry to join the physics group of [[August Kundt]] at the [[University of Berlin]], and completed his [[habilitation]] at the [[University of Graz]] in 1893. Because of his knowledge about glass and its colouring, in 1897 the [[Schott Glass]] factory offered him a job which he accepted. He invented the '''Jenaer Milchglas''' and conducted some research on the red [[Cranberry glass|Ruby glass]].

Zsigmondy left Schott Glass in 1900, but remained in Jena as private lecturer to conduct his research. Together with the optical instrument manufacturer Zeiss, he developed the slit [[ultramicroscope]]. His scientific career continued in 1908 at the [[University of Göttingen]], where he stayed for the rest of his professional career as professor of inorganic chemistry. In 1925, Zsigmondy received the [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]] for his work on colloids and the methods he used, such as the [[ultramicroscope]].

Before Zsigmondy finished his PhD thesis in organic chemistry, he published research on colouring glass with silver salts and dissolved silver particles, which he recovered by dissolving the glass in hydrofluoric acid.

During his stay in Graz, Zsigmondy accomplished his most notable research work, on the chemistry of [[colloid]]s. The exact mechanism which yields the red colour of the [[Cranberry glass|Cranberry]] or [[Ruby glass]] was a result of his studies of colloids.<ref>{{cite journal | title= Ueber wässrige Lösungen metallischen Goldes | author=Zsigmondy, R. | journal=Justus Liebig's Annalen der Chemie | volume=301 | issue=1 | pages=29–54 | year=1898 | doi=10.1002/jlac.18983010104| url=https://zenodo.org/record/1427499 }}</ref>
In later years he worked on gold [[hydrosol]]s and used them to characterize protein solutions. While in Jena he developed the slit [[ultramicroscope]] together with Henry Siedentopf. After moving to Göttingen, Zsigmondy improved his optical equipment for the observation of finest nanoparticles suspended in liquid solution. As a result, he introduced the immersion ultramicroscope in 1912.<ref>{{cite journal | title= The Invention of Immersion Ultramicroscopy in 1912—The Birth of Nanotechnology? | author=Mappes, T. | journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition | volume=51 | issue=45 | pages=11208–11212 | year=2012 | doi=10.1002/anie.201204688 | pmid=23065955}}</ref>

===Private life===

In 1903 Zsigmondy married Laura Luise Müller, with whom he had two daughters, Annemarie and Käthe. He died a few years after retirement in 1929 in [[Göttingen, Germany]].

He was a cousin of the architect [[Frigyes Schulek]], whose mother was Auguszta Zsigmondy. He is also related to the violinist [[Dénes Zsigmondy]].
