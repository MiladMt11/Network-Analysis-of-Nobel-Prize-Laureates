Houghton joined [[G. D. Searle & Company]] before moving to [[Chiron Corporation]] in 1982. It was at Chiron that Houghton together with colleagues [[Qui-Lim Choo]] and [[George Kuo]], and [[Daniel W. Bradley]] from the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], first discovered evidence for HCV.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Houghton|first1=M|title=The long and winding road leading to the identification of the hepatitis C virus.|journal=J.

Houghton was co-author of a series of seminal studies published in 1989 and 1990 that identified hepatitis C antibodies in blood, particularly among patients at higher risk of contracting the disease, including those who had received blood transfusions.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kuo|first1=G|last2=Choo|first2=Q-L|last3=Alter|first3=HJ|last4=Gitnick|first4=GI|last5=Redeker|first5=AG|last6=Purcell|first6=RH|last7=Miyamura|first7=T|last8=Dienstag|first8=JL|last9=Alter|first9=MJ|last10=Stevens|first10=CE|last11=Tegtmeier|first11=GE|last12=Bonino|first12=F|last13=Colombo|first13=M|last14=Lee|first14=W-S|last15=Kuo|first15=C|last16=Berger|first16=K|last17=Shuster|first17=JR|last18=Overby|first18=LR|last19=Bradley|first19=DW|last20=Houghton|first20=M|title=An assay for circulating antibodies to a major etiologic virus of human non-A, non-B hepatitis.|journal=Science|date=1989|volume=244|issue=4902|pages=362–364|doi=10.1126/science.2496467|pmid=2496467|bibcode=1989Sci...244..362K}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Esteban|first1=JI|last2=Viladomiu|first2=L|last3=Bonzalez|first3=A|last4=Roget|first4=M|last5=Genesca|first5=J|last6=Guardia|first6=J|last7=Esteban|first7=R|last8=Lopez-Talavera|first8=JC|last9=Hernandez|first9=JM|last10=Vargas|first10=V|last11=Buti|first11=M|last12=Kuo|first12=G|last13=Choo|first13=Q-L|last14=Houghton|first14=M|title=Hepatitis C virus antibodies among risk groups in Spain.|journal=Lancet|date=1989|volume=334|issue=8658|pages=294–297|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(89)90485-6|pmid=2569102|s2cid=23825621}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Van Der Poel|first1=CL|last2=Ressink|first2=HW|last3=Lelie|first3=PN|last4=Leentvaar-Kuypers|first4=A|last5=Choo|first5=Q-L|last6=Kuo|first6=G|last7=Houghton|first7=M|title=Anti-hepatitis C antibodies and non-A, non-B post-transfusion hepatitis in the Netherlands.|journal=Lancet|date=1989|volume=334|issue=8658|pages=297–298|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(89)90486-8|pmid=2569103|s2cid=25211687}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Alter |first1=HJ |last2=Purcell |first2=RH |last3=Shih |first3=JW |last4=Melpolder |first4=JC |last5=Houghton |first5=M |last6=Choo |first6=Q-L|last7=Kuo |first7=G |title=Detection of antibody to hepatitis C virus in prospectively followed transfusion recipients with acute and chronic non-A, non-B hepatitis |journal=N.
