'''Oliver Smithies''' (23 June 1925 – 10 January 2017) was a British-American [[geneticist]] and [[physical biochemistry|physical biochemist]].

==Early life and education==
Smithies was born in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], [[West Yorkshire]], England, to William Smithies and his wife Doris, née Sykes. His father sold life insurance policies and his mother taught English at [[Calderdale College|Halifax Technical College]]. He had a twin brother and a younger sister. He attended a primary school in the nearby village of [[Copley, West Yorkshire|Copley]] and then went to [[Heath Grammar School]] in Halifax.<ref name=Nobel_bio>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2007/smithies-bio.html |title=Oliver Smithies - Biographical |work=Nobelprize.org |publisher=Nobel Media |year=2014 |access-date=13 January 2017 }}</ref> He said that his love of science came from an early fascination with radios and [[telescopes]].<ref name="nytimes1">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/09/science/09nobel.html|title=3 Win Nobel in Medicine for Gene Technology |access-date=10 October 2007 |work=The New York Times| first=Lawrence K.| last=Altman| date=9 October 2007}}</ref>

He attended [[Balliol College, Oxford]] on a [[Brackenbury Scholarship]], initially reading [[medicine]]. He studied [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]], winning a prize in anatomy, and graduated with a [[British degree classification#First-class honours|first-class]] [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in animal physiology, including [[biochemistry]], in 1946. Inspired by tutorials from [[Alexander George Ogston|Alexander G. Ogston]] on applying [[physical chemistry]] to biological systems, Smithies then switched away from medicine to earn a second bachelor's degree in chemistry.<ref name=Nobel_bio /><ref name="nytimes1"/><ref name="nytimes2">{{cite news |url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE7DC163BF934A25753C1A963958260 |title= Scientist at Work: Oliver Smithies; Sprinting Along for Five Decades |access-date=10 October 2007 |work=The New York Times |first=Gina |last=Kolata |date=17 October 1995}}</ref> He published his first research paper, co-written with Ogston, in 1948.<ref name=Nobel_bio /> In 1951, he received a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|Master of Arts]] degree and a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in biochemistry under Ogston's supervision; his thesis was entitled "Physico-chemical properties of solutions of proteins".<ref name=UCLA_oral_history /><ref name=dphil>{{cite thesis |degree=DPhil |first=Oliver|last=Smithies |title=Physico-chemical properties of solutions of proteins |publisher=University of Oxford |date=1951 |id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.672736}}|url=https://copac.jisc.ac.uk/id/38735184?style=html|website=jisc.ac.uk}}</ref>

==Career==
[[File:George W. Bush meets with the American 2007 Nobel Award recipients-20071126.jpg|thumb|right|Oliver Smithies (second on the left)]]
Smithies was awarded a [[Commonwealth Fund]] fellowship to take up a post-doctoral position in the United States, in the laboratory of J. W. Williams at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]'s Department of Chemistry.<ref name=Nobel_bio /> A problem with acquiring a U.S. visa, due to a condition of the Commonwealth Fund fellowship, then forced him to leave the U.S. From 1953 to 1960, he worked as an associate research faculty member, under [[insulin]] researcher David A. Scott, in the [[Connaught Medical Research Laboratory]] at the [[University of Toronto]] in Canada.<ref name=Nobel_bio /><ref name="nytimes1"/> He learned [[medical genetics]] from Norma Ford Walker at the [[The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto|Hospital for Sick Children]] in Toronto.<ref name=Coffman_AnnuRevPhysiol>{{cite journal |title=A Conversation with Oliver Smithies |authors=Oliver Smithies, Tom Coffman |journal=[[Annual Reviews (publisher)|Annual Review of Physiology]] |year=2015 |volume=77 |pages=1–11 |doi=10.1146/annurev-physiol-021014-071806|pmid=25668016 }}</ref>

In 1960, Smithies returned to the University of Wisconsin–Madison, where he worked in the Department of Genetics until 1988 as, successively, assistant, associate and Leon J. Cole and Hilldale Professor of Genetics and Medical Genetics.<ref name="nytimes1"/> Subsequently, he was the Excellence Professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].<ref name="massryprize">{{cite web|url = http://www.unc.edu/news/archives/aug02/smithies082802.htm |title = Smithies wins top award from Massry Foundation |access-date=10 October 2007 |publisher=University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill News Service }}</ref> He continued to work in his lab there daily into his eighties.<ref name="Williams2011" /><ref name=Derewicz_Endeavors>{{cite journal| url=http://smithies.lib.unc.edu/biography/ |title=Life at the Bench |author=Mark Derewicz |journal=Endeavors |date=1 January 2008 |access-date=13 January 2017 }}</ref> He co-authored a total of more than 350 research papers and reviews, dating from 1948 to 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://smithies.lib.unc.edu/bibliography/ |title=Bibliography |work=Dr. Oliver Smithies Research Archive |publisher=University of North Carolina |access-date=13 January 2017 }}</ref>

==Research==
Smithies developed the technique of [[gel electrophoresis]] using a [[starch]] matrix, as a sideline of (unproductive) research into an insulin precursor molecule, at the University of Toronto.<ref name=Nobel_bio /><ref name=unc/> This improved the ability to resolve proteins by electrophoresis.<ref name="Williams2011" /> He was assisted technically in his later electrophoresis work by Otto Hiller. He used starch electrophoresis to reveal differences between normal human [[plasma protein]]s, and in collaboration with Norma Ford Walker, showed that the variation was inherited, which stimulated his interest in [[genetics]].<ref name=Nobel_bio />

While at the University of Wisconsin in the 1980s, Smithies developed [[gene targeting]] in mice, a method of replacing single mouse genes using [[homologous recombination]]. [[Mario Capecchi]] also developed the technique independently.<ref name="massryprize"/><ref name=unc/> This research is the basis of methods used worldwide to investigate the role of particular genes in a wide range of human diseases including [[cancer]], [[cystic fibrosis]] and [[diabetes]].<ref>{{citation |url=https://royalsociety.org/people/oliver-smithies-12306/ |title=Oliver Smithies: Biography |publisher=[[Royal Society]] |access-date=13 January 2017 }}</ref> In 2002, Smithies worked with his wife, [[Nobuyo Maeda]], studying [[high blood pressure]] using genetically altered mice.<ref name="massryprize"/>

==Awards and honors==
Smithies won the 2001 [[Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research]], jointly with [[Martin Evans]] ([[Cardiff University]]) and [[Mario Capecchi]] ([[University of Utah]]), for their work on homologous recombination.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/library/2001b_cit.shtml|title = 2001 Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research|access-date=1 October 2007|publisher=Lasker Foundation|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930181605/http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/library/2001b_cit.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 30 September 2007}}</ref> He received the [[Wolf Prize in Medicine]], with Capecchi and [[Ralph L.
