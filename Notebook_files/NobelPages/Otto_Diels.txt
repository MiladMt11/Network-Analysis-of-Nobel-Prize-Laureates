'''Otto Paul Hermann Diels''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɔto ˈdiːls|-|De-Otto Diels.ogg}}; 23 January 1876 &ndash; 7 March 1954) was a [[German people|German]] [[chemist]]. His most notable work was done with [[Kurt Alder]] on the [[Diels–Alder reaction]], a method for [[diene]] synthesis.<ref name=nobel>{{Nobelprize|accessdate=2020-04-29}}</ref>   The pair was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1950 for their work.  Their method of synthesizing cyclic organic compounds proved valuable for the manufacture of synthetic rubber and plastic.<ref name=brittanica>{{cite web|title=Otto Paul Hermann Diels|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/162657/Otto-Paul-Hermann-Diels|access-date=2013-12-07|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref>  He completed his education at the [[University of Berlin]], where he later worked.  Diels was employed at the [[University of Kiel]] when he completed his Nobel Prize–winning work, and remained there until he retired in 1945.  Diels was married, with five children.  He died in 1954.

==Early life==
Diels was born on 23 January 1876 in [[Hamburg, Germany]], and moved with his family to [[Berlin]] when he was two years old.<ref name=nobel />  He studied in Berlin at [[Joachimsthalsches Gymnasium]] before attending the [[University of Berlin]] starting in 1895.  While at university, Diels studied [[chemistry]] under [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]], eventually graduating in 1899.<ref name=nobel />

==Professional career==

Immediately after graduating from the University of Berlin, he was offered a position with the Institute of Chemistry at the school.  He advanced quickly through the ranks at the school, eventually ending up as Department Head in 1913.<ref name=nobel />  He remained at the University of Berlin until 1915, when he accepted a position at the [[University of Kiel]], where he remained until his retirement in 1945.  It was during his time at Kiel, where he worked with [[Kurt Alder]] developing the [[Diels–Alder reaction]], for which they were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1950.<ref name=nobel />  His work with Alder developed a synthetic method which allows the synthesis of unsaturated cyclic compounds.<ref name=nobel />  This work was important in the production of synthetic rubber and plastic compounds.<ref name = brittanica />

==Personal life==
Diels married Paula Geyer in 1909.  The couple had five children together, three sons and two daughters.  Two of his sons were [[killed in action]] during [[World War II]].  In his free time, Diels enjoyed reading, music and traveling.  He died on 7 March 1954.<ref name=nobel />
