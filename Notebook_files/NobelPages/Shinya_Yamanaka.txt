{{Nihongo|'''Shinya Yamanaka'''|山中 伸弥|Yamanaka Shin'ya|extra=born September 4, 1962}} is a Japanese [[stem cell]] researcher, winner of the [[Nobel Prize]].<ref name="stem1"/><ref name="stem2"/><ref name="stem3"/> He serves as the director of Center for iPS Cell ([[induced Pluripotent Stem Cell]]) Research and Application and a professor at the Institute for Frontier Medical Sciences at [[Kyoto University]]; as a senior investigator at the [[UCSF]]-affiliated [[Gladstone Institutes]] in San Francisco, California; and as a professor of anatomy at [[University of California, San Francisco]] (UCSF). Yamanaka is also a past president of the [[International Society for Stem Cell Research]] (ISSCR).

He received the 2010 [[BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award]] in the biomedicine category, the 2011 [[Wolf Prize in Medicine]] with [[Rudolf Jaenisch]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wolffund.org.il/index.php?dir=site&page=winners&cs=275|title=Shinya Yamanaka Winner of Wolf Prize in Medicine – 2011|publisher=[[Wolf Foundation]]}}</ref> and the 2012 [[Millennium Technology Prize]] together with [[Linus Torvalds]]. In 2012, he and [[John Gurdon]] were awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] for the discovery that mature cells can be converted to [[stem cells]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2012/press.html|publisher=Nobel Media AB|date=8 October 2012|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine – 2012 Press Release}}</ref> In 2013, he was awarded the $3 million [[Breakthrough Prize in Life Sciences]] for his work.

== Education ==
Yamanaka was born in [[Higashiōsaka, Osaka|Higashiōsaka]], Japan, in 1962. After graduating from Tennōji High School attached to [[Osaka Kyoiku University]],<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://english.kyodonews.jp/photos/2012/10/186903.html | title=Login - Kyodo News}}</ref> he received his [[Medical Doctor|M.D.]] degree at [[Kobe University]] in 1987 and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree at [[Osaka City University#Graduate schools|Osaka City University Graduate School]] in 1993. After this, he went through a residency in orthopedic surgery at National Osaka Hospital and a [[postdoctoral]] fellowship at the [[J. David Gladstone Institutes]] of [[Cardiovascular Disease]], San Francisco.

Afterwards he worked at the Gladstone Institutes in San Francisco, US, and [[Nara Institute of Science and Technology]] in Japan. Yamanaka is currently a professor at [[Kyoto University]], where he directs its Center for iPS Research and Application. He is also a senior investigator at the Gladstone Institutes as well as the director of the Center for iPS Cell Research and Application.<ref>[http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2012/press.html "The 2012 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine - Press Release"]. Nobelprize.org. Nobel Media AB 2013. Web. 28 Nov 2013.</ref>

== Professional career ==
Between 1987 and 1989, Yamanaka was a [[residency (medicine)|resident]] in orthopedic surgery at the National Osaka Hospital. His first operation was to remove a benign tumor from his friend Shuichi Hirata, a task he could not complete after one hour when a skilled surgeon would have taken ten minutes or so. Some [[Senpai and kōhai|seniors]] referred to him as "Jamanaka", a pun on the Japanese word for obstacle.<ref name="ajw.asahi.com">[[Asahi Shimbun]] [http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201210090063 After failure as a surgeon, Yamanaka rises to stem cell glory October 9, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012002427/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/behind_news/social_affairs/AJ201210090063 |date=October 12, 2012 }}</ref>

From 1993 to 1996, he was at the [[Gladstone Institutes|Gladstone Institute]] of Cardiovascular Disease. Between 1996 and 1999, he was an assistant professor at Osaka City University Medical School, but found himself mostly looking after mice in the laboratory, not doing actual research.<ref name="ajw.asahi.com"/>

His wife advised him to become a practicing doctor, but instead he applied for a position at the [[Nara Institute of Science and Technology]]. He stated that he could and would clarify the characteristics of embryonic stem cells, and this can-do attitude won him the job. From 1999–2003, he was an [[associate professor]] there, and started the research that would later win him the 2012 Nobel Prize. He became a full professor and remained at the institute in that position from 2003–2005. Between 2004 and 2010, Yamanaka was a professor at the Institute for Frontier Medical Sciences.<ref>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210081040/http://www.frontier.kyoto-u.ac.jp/rc02/kyojuE.html| archive-date= February 10, 2008| url= http://www.frontier.kyoto-u.ac.jp/rc02/kyojuE.html |title=Shinya Yamanaka MD., PhD|work=Kyoto University}}</ref> Currently, Yamanaka is the director and a professor at the Center for iPS Cell Research and Application at [[Kyoto University]].

In 2006, he and his team generated [[induced pluripotent stem cell]]s (iPS cells) from adult mouse [[fibroblast]]s.<ref name="stem1"/> iPS cells closely resemble [[embryonic stem cell]]s, the ''in vitro'' equivalent of the part of the [[blastocyst]] (the embryo a few days after fertilization) which grows to become the embryo proper. They could show that his iPS cells were [[pluripotent]], i.e. capable of generating all cell lineages of the body. Later he and his team generated iPS cells from human adult fibroblasts,<ref name="stem2"/> again as the first group to do so.
A key difference from previous attempts by the field was his team's use of multiple [[transcription factor]]s, instead of [[transfection|transfecting]] one transcription factor per experiment<!-- from lecture by José Silva -->. They started with 24 transcription factors known to be important in the early embryo, but could in the end reduce it to 4 transcription factors – [[Sox2]], [[Oct4]], [[Klf4]] and [[c-Myc]].<ref name="stem1"/>

== Yamanaka's Nobel Prize–winning research in iPS cells ==
The '''2012 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine''' was awarded jointly to Sir John B. Gurdon and Shinya Yamanaka "for the discovery that mature cells can be reprogrammed to become [[pluripotent]]."<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2012/The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2012].

=== Historical Background leading up to Yamanaka's research ===
The prevalent view during the early 20th century was that mature cells were permanently locked into the differentiated state and cannot return to a fully immature, pluripotent stem cell state. It was thought that cellular differentiation can only be a unidirectional process. Therefore, non-differentiated egg/early embryo cells can only develop into specialized cells. However, stem cells with limited potency (adult stem cells) remain in bone marrow, intestine, skin etc. to act as a source of cell replacement.<ref>[http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2012/advanced.html "The 2012 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine - Advanced Information"]. Nobelprize.org. Nobel Media AB 2013. Web. 29 Nov 2013.</ref>

The fact that differentiated cell types had specific patterns of proteins suggested irreversible epigenetic modifications or genetic alterations to be the cause of unidirectional cell differentiation. So, cells progressively become more restricted in the differentiation potential and eventually lose pluripotency.<ref>[http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2012/popular.html "The 2012 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine - Popular Information"]. Nobelprize.org. Nobel Media AB 2013. Web. 28 Nov 2013.</ref>

In 1962, [[John Gurdon|John B. Gurdon]] demonstrated that the nucleus from a differentiated frog intestinal epithelial cell can generate a fully functional tadpole via transplantation to an enucleated egg. Gurdon used [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]] (SCNT) as a method to understand reprogramming and how cells change in specialization. He concluded that differentiated somatic cell nuclei had the potential to revert to pluripotency. This was a paradigm shift at the time. It showed that a differentiated cell nucleus has retained the capacity to successfully revert to an undifferentiated state, with the potential to restart development (pluripotent capacity).

However, the question still remained whether an intact differentiated cell could be fully reprogrammed to become pluripotent.

=== Yamanaka's research ===
Shinya Yamanaka proved that introduction of a small set of transcription factors into a differentiated cell was sufficient to revert the cell to a pluripotent state. 
Yamanaka focused on factors that are important for maintaining pluripotency in embryonic stem (ES) cells. This was the first time an intact differentiated somatic cell could be reprogrammed to become pluripotent. 

Knowing that transcription factors were involved in the maintenance of the pluripotent state, he selected a set of 24 ES cell transcriptional factors as candidates to reinstate pluripotency in somatic cells. First, he collected the 24 candidate factors. When all 24 genes encoding these transcription factors were introduced into skin fibroblasts, few actually generated colonies that were remarkably similar to ES cells.
Secondly, further experiments were conducted with smaller numbers of transcription factors added to identify the key factors, through a very simple and yet sensitive assay system.
Lastly, he identified the four key genes. They found that 4 transcriptional factors (Myc, Oct3/4, Sox2 and Klf4) were sufficient to convert mouse embryonic or adult fibroblasts to pluripotent stem cells (capable of producing teratomas ''in vivo'' and contributing to chimeric mice).

These pluripotent cells are called iPS (induced pluripotent stem) cells; they appeared with very low frequency. iPS cells can be selected by inserting the b-geo gene into the Fbx15 locus. The Fbx15 promoter is active in pluripotent stem cells which induce b-geo expression, which in turn gives rise to G418 resistance; this resistance helps us identify the iPS cells in culture.

Moreover, in 2007, Yamanaka and his colleagues found iPS cells with germline transmission (via selecting for Oct4 or Nanog gene). Also in 2007, they were the first to produce human iPS cells.

Some issues that current methods of induced pluripotency face are the very low production rate of iPS cells and the fact that the 4 transcriptional factors are shown to be oncogenic.

In July 2014, a scandal regarding the research of [[Haruko Obokata]] was connected to Yamanaka. She could not find the lab notes from the period in question<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/07/world/asia/academic-scandal-shakes-japan.html |title = Academic Scandal Shakes Japan|newspaper = The New York Times|date = July 6, 2014}}</ref> and was made to apologise.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2014/04/28/japanese-nobel-winner-latest-to-apologize-over-stem-cell-research/ |title = Japanese Nobel Winner Latest to Apologize over Stem-Cell Research|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|date = April 28, 2014|last1 = Landers|first1 = Peter}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/banyan/2014/07/regenerative-medicine |title = Bad science|newspaper = The Economist|date = July 10, 2014}}</ref>

=== Further research and future prospects ===
Since the original discovery by Yamanaka, much further research has been done in this field, and many improvements have been made to the technology. Improvements made to Yamanaka's research as well as future prospects of his findings are as follows:

1. The delivery mechanism of pluripotency factors has been improved. At first retroviral vectors, that integrate randomly in the genome and cause deregulation of genes that contribute to tumor formation, were used. However, now, non-integrating viruses, stabilised RNAs or proteins, or episomal plasmids (integration-free delivery mechanism) are used.

2. Transcription factors required for inducing pluripotency in different cell types have been identified (e.g. neural stem cells).

3. Small substitutive molecules were identified, that can substitute for the function of the transcription factors.

4. [[Transdifferentiation]] experiments were carried out. They tried to change the cell fate without proceeding through a pluripotent state. They were able to systematically identify genes that carry out transdifferentiation using combinations of transcription factors that induce cell fate switches. They found trandifferentiation within germ layer and between germ layers, e.g., 
exocrine cells to endocrine cells, fibroblast cells to myoblast cells, fibroblast cells to cardiomyocyte cells, fibroblast cells to neurons

5. [[Cell replacement therapy]] with iPS cells is a possibility. Stem cells can replace diseased or lost cells in degenerative disorders and they are less prone to immune rejection. However, there is a danger that it may introduce mutations or other genomic abnormalities that render it unsuitable for cell therapy. So, there are still many challenges, but it is a very exciting and promising research area. Further work is required to guarantee safety for patients.

6. Can medically use iPS cells from patients with genetic and other disorders to gain insights into the disease process.
	- Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Rett syndrome, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), α1-antitrypsin deficiency, familial hypercholesterolemia and glycogen storage disease type 1A. 
	- For cardiovascular disease, Timothy syndrome, LEOPARD syndrome, type 1 and 2 long QT syndrome
	- Alzheimer’s, Spinocerebellar ataxia, Huntington’s etc.

7. iPS cells provide screening platforms for development and validation of therapeutic compounds. For example, kinetin was a novel compound found in iPS cells from familial dysautonomia and beta blockers & ion channel blockers for long QT syndrome were identified with iPS cells.

Yamanaka's research has “opened a new door and the world's scientists have set forth on a long journey of exploration, hoping to find our cells’ true potential.”<ref>{{cite journal|last=Danielsson|first=Ola|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2012|date=December 2012|page=7|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2012/popular-medicineprize2012.pdf}}</ref>

In 2013, iPS cells were used to generate a human vascularized and functional liver in mice in Japan. Multiple stem cells were used to differentiate the component parts of the liver, which then self-organized into the complex structure. When placed into a mouse host, the liver vessels connected to the hosts vessels and performed normal liver functions, including breaking down of drugs and liver secretions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Takebe|first1=Takanori|last2=Sekine|first2=Keisuke|last3=Enomura|first3=Masahiro|last4=Koike|first4=Hiroyuki|last5=Kimura|first5=Masaki|last6=Ogaeri|first6=Takunori|last7=Zhang|first7=Ran-Ran|last8=Ueno|first8=Yasuharu|last9=Zheng|first9=Yun-Wen|date=2013-07-25|title=Vascularized and functional human liver from an iPSC-derived organ bud transplant|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=499|issue=7459|pages=481–484|doi=10.1038/nature12271|pmid=23823721|bibcode=2013Natur.499..481T|s2cid=4423004|issn=0028-0836}}</ref>
