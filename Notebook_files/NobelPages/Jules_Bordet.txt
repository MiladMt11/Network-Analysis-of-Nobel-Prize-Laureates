'''Jules Jean Baptiste Vincent Bordet''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ɔːr|ˈ|d|eɪ}}; 13 June 1870 – 6 April 1961) was a Belgian [[immunologist]] and [[microbiologist]]. The [[Genus|bacterial genus]] ''[[Bordetella]]'' is named after him. The [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] was awarded to him in 1919 for his discoveries relating to immunity.

==Education and early life==
Bordet was born at [[Soignies]], [[Belgium]].  He graduated as Doctor of Medicine from the [[Free University of Brussels (1834–1969)|Free University of Brussels]] in 1892 and began his work at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in [[Paris]] in 1894, in the laboratory of [[Elie Metchnikoff]], who had just discovered [[phagocytosis]] of bacteria by [[white blood cell]]s, an expression of cellular immunity.

==Career==
In 1895 Bordet made his discovery that the bacteriolytic effect of acquired specific [[antibody]] is significantly enhanced ''in vivo'' by the presence of innate serum components which he termed alexine (but which are now known as [[Complement system|complement]]). Four years later, in 1899, he described a similar destructive process involving complement, "[[hemolysis]]", in which foreign red blood cells are ruptured or "lysed" following exposure to immune serum. In 1900, he left Paris to found the [[Pasteur Institute]] in [[Brussels]] but continued to work extensively on the mechanisms involved in the action of complement. These studies became the basis for complement-fixation testing methods that enabled the development of serological tests for [[syphilis]] (specifically, the development of the [[Wassermann test]] by [[August Paul von Wassermann|August von Wassermann]]). The same technique is used today in serologic testing for countless other diseases.

With [[Octave Gengou]], he isolated ''[[Bordetella pertussis]]'' in pure culture in 1906 and posited it as the cause of [[pertussis|whooping cough]]. He became Professor of [[Bacteriology]] at the Université Libre de Bruxelles in 1907.

==Awards and honours==
In March 1916, he was elected a Foreign Member of the [[Royal Society]]<ref name="frs">{{Cite journal | last1 = Oakley | first1 = C.

This theory collapsed in 1941 with the publication by Ruska of the first electron microscope pictures of bacteriophages.<ref>Hausler, Thomas (2007) ''Viruses Vs.

Bordet died in 1961 and was interred in the [[Ixelles Cemetery]] in Brussels.
