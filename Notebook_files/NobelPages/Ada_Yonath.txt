==Scientific career==
[[File:Ada Yonath Weizmann Institute of Science.jpg|thumb|Ada Yonath at the [[Weizmann Institute of Science]]]]
Yonath accepted postdoctoral positions at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] (1969) and [[MIT]] (1970). While a postdoc at MIT she spent some time in the lab of subsequent 1976 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|chemistry Nobel Prize]] winner [[William Lipscomb|William N. Lipscomb, Jr.]] of [[Harvard University]] where she was inspired to pursue very large structures.<ref name=CEN_Nov_2009/>

In 1970, she established what was for nearly a decade the only [[protein]] crystallography laboratory in Israel. Then, from 1979 to 1984 she was a group leader with [[Heinz-Günter Wittmann]] at the [[Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics]] in Berlin. She was visiting professor at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1977–78.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.uchicago.edu/news.php?asset_id=1729|title=New chemistry Nobelist was UChicago visiting prof, conducted research at Argonne|author=anonymous|work=uchicago.edu|access-date=2017-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610040216/http://news.uchicago.edu/news.php?asset_id=1729|archive-date=2010-06-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> She headed a [[Max-Planck Institute]] Research Unit at [[DESY]] in [[Hamburg]], Germany (1986–2004) in parallel to her research activities at the Weizmann Institute.

Yonath focuses on the mechanisms underlying [[protein biosynthesis]], by ribosomal crystallography, a research line she pioneered over twenty years ago despite considerable skepticism of the international scientific community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2009/speedread.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2009 – Speed Read|work=nobelprize.org}}</ref> Ribosomes translate [[RNA]] into protein and because they have slightly different structures in microbes, when compared to [[eukaryote]]s, such as human cells, they are often a target for antibiotics. In 2000 and 2001, she determined the complete high-resolution structures of both ribosomal subunits and discovered within the otherwise asymmetric ribosome, the universal symmetrical region that provides the framework and navigates the process of polypeptide polymerization. Consequently, she showed that the ribosome is a [[ribozyme]] that places its substrates in [[stereochemistry]] suitable for [[peptide bond]] formation and for substrate-mediated [[catalysis]]. In 1993 she visualized the path taken by the nascent proteins, namely the ribosomal tunnel, and recently revealed the dynamics elements enabling its involvement in elongation arrest, gating, intra-cellular regulation and nascent chain trafficking into their folding space.

Additionally, Yonath elucidated the modes of action of over twenty different [[antibiotic]]s targeting the ribosome, illuminated mechanisms of [[drug resistance]] and [[drug synergy|synergism]], deciphered the structural basis for antibiotic selectivity and showed how it plays a key role in clinical usefulness and therapeutic effectiveness, thus paving the way for structure-based [[drug design]].

For enabling ribosomal crystallography Yonath introduced a novel technique, [[cryo bio-crystallography]], which became routine in structural biology and allowed intricate projects otherwise considered formidable.<ref name="Hope">{{cite journal | last1=Hope | first1=H. | last2=Frolow | first2=F. | last3=von Böhlen | first3=K. | last4=Makowski | first4=I. | last5=Kratky | first5=C. | last6=Halfon | first6=Y. | last7=Danz | first7=H. | last8=Webster | first8=P. | last9=Bartels | first9=K.
