== Military career ==

At the age of 14, in early 1991,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Endeshaw |first1=Dawit |title=The rise of Abiy "Abiyot" Ahmed |url=https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/article/rise-abiy-abiyot-ahmed |access-date=25 March 2019 |newspaper=The Reporter |date=31 March 2018 |quote=For some time the EPRDF, was in talks with the OLF; in fact, the later was part of the then transitional government. OLF was, at the time, very popular in Oromia region. However, the peaceful talks failed to bear fruit as things turn to become violent. That was when alternative forces like the Oromo People's Democratic Organization (OPDO) came to the fore.<br /> According to people who witnessed that critical period, the OLF had strong support in Agaro like most parts of Oromia region (No statistical evidence exists to support this claim).<br /> It was at that time that Abiy's family was directly affected by the political transition in the country. Abiy's father and his eldest son, Kedir Ahmed, were arrested for some time.<br /> Unfortunately, Kedir was killed during that time in what was believed to be a politically motivated assassination, according to people close to the family.<br /> By the time, Agaro, which now has a population of, 41,085, was believed to be a stronghold of the OLF.<br /> "I think losing his brother at that age was a turning point in Abiy's life," Miftah Hudin Aba Jebel, a childhood friend of Abiy, told The Reporter. "I mean we were young and I remember one night Abiy asking me to join the struggle," he recalls. "To be honest, it was difficult for me to understand what he was saying."<br /> According to multiple sources, Abiy joined the struggle during early 1991, just a few months before the downfall of the military regime, almost at the age of 15.<br /> "By the time we were teenagers; Abiy, another young man by the name Komitas, who was a driver for Abadula Gemeda at the time, and myself joined the OPDO," Getish Mamo, the then member of OPDO's music band called Bifttu Oromia, told The Reporter. "We were also close with Abadula Gemeda." Abadula was one of the founders of the OPDO and current speaker of the House of People's Representatives.<br /> Abiy, at the time, was working as a radio operator, according to Getish.}}</ref> he joined the armed struggle against the [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia|regime]] of [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]] after the death of his oldest brother. He was a child soldier, affiliated to the [[Oromo Democratic Party]] (ODP), which at that time was a tiny organization of only around 200 fighters in the large coalition army of about 100,000 fighters that resulted in the regime's fall later that year.<ref name="prelude" /><ref name="abiyot" /><ref name=":0">{{cite web |website=ZeHabesha TV |title=Dr Abiy Ahmed interview with Amhara TV |date=21 November 2017 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRTTnLIwghQ |access-date=25 March 2019 |via=YouTube |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401171617/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRTTnLIwghQ |archive-date=1 April 2019 }}</ref> As there were only so few ODP fighters in an army with its core of about 90,000 [[Tigrayans]], Abiy quickly had to learn the [[Tigrinya language]].

After the fall of the Derg, he took formal military training from Assefa Brigade in [[Welega Province|West Wollega]] and was stationed there.

== Political career ==

=== Member of Parliament ===

Abiy started his political career as a member of the [[Oromo Democratic Party]] (ODP).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.opdo.org.et/About%20Us.htm |title=About Us |website=Oromo Democratic Party |access-date=19 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317114901/http://www.opdo.org.et/About%20Us.htm |archive-date=17 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The ODP has been the ruling party in [[Oromia Region]] since 1991 and also one of four coalition parties of the ruling coalition in Ethiopia, the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF). He became a member of the central committee of ODP and congress member of the Executive Committee of the EPRDF in quick succession.<ref name="prelude" /> In the 2010 national election, Abiy represented the [[Districts of Ethiopia|district]] of [[Agaro]] and became an elected member of the [[House of Peoples' Representatives]], the lower chamber of the Ethiopian [[Federal Parliamentary Assembly]]. Before and during his time of parliamentary service, there were several religious clashes among Muslims and Christians in [[Jimma Zone]]. Some of these confrontations turned violent and resulted in the loss of life and property. Abiy, as an elected member of parliament took a proactive role in working with several religious institutions and elders to bring about reconciliation in the zone. He helped set up a forum entitled "Religious Forum for Peace"'','' an outcome of the need to devise a sustainable resolution mechanism to restore peaceful Muslim-Christian community interaction in the region.<ref name="cve" />

In 2014, during his time in parliament, Abiy became the director-general of a new and in 2011 founded Government Research Institute called [[Science and Technology Information Center (Ethiopia)|Science and Technology Information Center (STIC)]].<ref name="abiyot" /><ref name=":3">{{Cite web |url=http://www.stic.gov.et/about-us |title=About STIC |website=Stic.gov.et |access-date=18 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219210734/http://www.stic.gov.et/about-us |archive-date=19 February 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The following year, Abiy became an executive member of ODP.

=== Rise to power ===

Starting from 2015, Abiy became one of the central figures in the violent fight against illegal [[land grabbing]] activities in Oromia Region and especially around [[Addis Ababa]]. Although the Addis Ababa Master Plan at the heart of the land-grabbing plans was stopped in 2016, the disputes continued for some time resulting in injuries and deaths.<ref name="aamp">{{cite web |url=http://p.dw.com/p/2vBBQ |title=Ethiopia: Who is new Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali? |date=29 March 2018 |website=Deutsche Welle |access-date=1 April 2018}}</ref> It was this fight against land-grabbing, that finally boosted Abiy Ahmed's political career, brought him into the spotlight and allowed him to climb the political ladder.<ref name="prelude" />

In October 2015, Abiy became the Ethiopian [[Ministry of Science and Technology, Ethiopia|Minister of Science and Technology (MoST)]], a post which he left after only 12 months. From October 2016 on, Abiy served as Deputy President of [[Oromia Region]] as part of the team of Oromia Region's president [[Lemma Megersa]] while staying a member of the Ethiopian Federal House of Peoples' Representatives.<ref name=":4" /><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.ena.gov.et/en/index.php/economy/item/3082-oromia-committed-to-support-domestic-investors-chief-administrator-lemma-megersa |title=Oromia Committed to Support Domestic Investors: Chief Administrator Lemma Megersa |website=ena.gov.et |access-date=18 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220033125/http://www.ena.gov.et/en/index.php/economy/item/3082-oromia-committed-to-support-domestic-investors-chief-administrator-lemma-megersa |archive-date=20 February 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Abiy Ahmed also became the head of the Oromia Urban Development and Planning Office. In this role, Abiy was expected to be the major driving force behind Oromia Economic Revolution, Oromia Land and Investment reform, youth employment as well as resistance to widespread land grabbing in Oromia region.<ref>{{cite web |title=ኦሮሚያ፣ የ"ኢኮኖሚ አብዮት" |trans-title=Oromia, the "Economy Revolution" |date=10 March 2017 |url=http://www.dw.com/am/%E1%8A%A6%E1%88%AE%E1%88%9A%E1%8B%AB-%E1%8B%A8%E1%8A%A2%E1%8A%AE%E1%8A%96%E1%88%9A-%E1%8A%A0%E1%89%A5%E1%8B%AE%E1%89%B5/a-37875280 |website=[[Deutsche Welle]] |language=am |access-date=19 February 2018}}</ref> As one of his duties in office, he took care of the one million displaced [[Oromo people]] displaced from the [[Somali Region]] from the 2017 unrest.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41278618 |title=What is behind clashes in Ethiopia's Oromia and Somali regions? |date=18 September 2017 |website=BBC News |access-date=19 February 2018 }}</ref>

As head of the ODP Secretariat from October 2017, Abiy facilitated the formation of a new alliance between the [[Oromo people|Oromo]] and [[Amhara people|Amhara]] groups, which together constitute two-thirds of the Ethiopian population.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/118697174971952/videos/614501718724826/ |title=Amhara Mass Media Agency |website=Facebook.com |access-date=19 February 2018}}</ref>

In early 2018, many political observers considered Abiy and Lemma Megersa as the most popular politicians within the Oromo community, as well as other Ethiopian communities.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theeastafrican.co.ke/news/Ethiopia-new-prime-minister/2558-4308896-5gwocw/index.html |title=Who will become Ethiopia's new prime minister and how? |date=17 February 2018 |newspaper=[[The East African]] |access-date=19 February 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/ethiopias-state-emergency-20-180219112158956.html |title=Ethiopia's state of emergency 2.0 |last=Allo |first=Awol K. |website=Al Jazeera |access-date=20 February 2018}}</ref> This came after several years of unrest in Ethiopia.

Until early 2018, Abiy continued to serve as head of the ODP secretariat and of the Oromia Housing and Urban Development Office and as Deputy President of Oromia Region. He left all these posts after his election as the leader of the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thereporterethiopia.com/article/movers-and-shakers |title=Movers and Shakers!!! |first=Dawit |last=Endeshaw |date=4 November 2017 |newspaper=The Reporter |access-date=20 February 2018}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite news |url=http://www.ethpress.gov.et/herald/index.php/technology/item/8472-exciting-opportunity-for-investors-in-oromia-state |title=Exciting opportunity for investors in Oromia State |newspaper=[[Ethiopian Herald]] |access-date=19 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180220033118/http://www.ethpress.gov.et/herald/index.php/technology/item/8472-exciting-opportunity-for-investors-in-oromia-state |archive-date=20 February 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== EPRDF leadership election ===

Following three years of protest and unrest, on 15 February 2018 the Ethiopian Prime Minister, [[Hailemariam Desalegn]], announced his resignation – which included his resignation from the post of EPRDF chairman.
With the EPRDF's large majority in Parliament, its EPRDF chairman was all but assured of becoming the next Prime Minister. The EPRDF chairman, on the other hand, is one of the heads of the four parties that make up the ruling coalition: [[Oromo Democratic Party]] (ODP), [[Amhara Democratic Party]] (ADP), [[Southern Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement]] (SEPDM) and [[Tigray People's Liberation Front]] (TPLF).<ref>{{cite news |title=Abiy Ahmed elected as chairman of Ethiopia's ruling coalition |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/abiy-ahmed-elected-chairman-ethiopia-ruling-coalition-180327201015850.html |access-date=11 October 2019 |work=www.aljazeera.com |date=28 March 2018}}</ref>

Hailemariam's resignation triggered the first ever contested leadership election among EPRDF coalition members to replace him. A lot of political observers made Lemma Megersa (the ODP chairman) and Abiy Ahmed the front-runners to become the Leader of the ruling coalition and eventually [[Prime Minister of Ethiopia]]. Despite being the clear favorite for the general public, Lemma Megersa was not a member of the national parliament, a requirement to become Prime Minister as required by the Ethiopian constitution. Therefore, Lemma Megersa was excluded from the leadership race.<ref name="Cameroun">{{cite web |title=Ethiopia: Dr. Abiy Ahmed tipped to become next PM |url=https://www.journalducameroun.com/en/ethiopia-dr-abiy-ahmed-tipped-to-become-next-pm/ |website=Journal du Cameroun |date=23 February 2018}}</ref> On 22 February 2018, Lemma Megersa's party, ODP, called for an emergency executive committee meeting and replaced him as Chairman of ODP with Abiy Ahmed, who was a member of parliament. Some observers saw that as a strategic move by the ODP to retain its leadership role within the coalition and to promote Abiy Ahmed to become Prime Minister.<ref name="EritreaHub" />

On 1 March 2018, the 180 EPRDF executive committee members started their meeting to elect the leader of the party. Each of the four parties sent in 45 members. The contest for the leadership was among Abiy Ahmed of ODP, [[Demeke Mekonnen]], the Deputy Prime Minister and ADP leader, [[Shiferaw Shigute]] as Chairman of SEPDM and [[Debretsion Gebremichael]] as the Leader of TPLF. Despite being the overwhelming favorite by the majority of Ethiopians, Abiy Ahmed faced major opposition from TPLF and SEPDM members during the leadership discussions.<ref>{{cite news |title=Seven people who could be Ethiopia's next leader |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-43414557 |access-date=11 October 2019 |work=BBC News |date=16 March 2018}}</ref>

On 27 March 2018, a few hours before the beginning of the leadership elections, Demeke Mekonnen, who had been seen as the major opponent to Abiy Ahmed, dropped out of the race. Many observers saw this as an endorsement of Abiy Ahmed. Demeke was then approved as Deputy Prime Minister for another term. Following Demeke's exit, Abiy Ahmed received a presumably unanimous vote from both the ADP and ODP executive members, with 18 additional votes in a secret ballot coming from elsewhere. By midnight, Abiy Ahmed was declared Chairman of the ruling coalition in Ethiopia, the EPRDF, and was considered as the Prime Minister Designate of Ethiopia by receiving 108 votes while Shiferaw Shigute received 58 and Debretsion Gebremichael received 2 votes.<ref name="chair" /> On 2 April 2018, Abiy Ahmed was elected as Prime Minister of Ethiopia by the House of Representatives and sworn in.<ref name="16th" />

== Prime Minister of Ethiopia ==

On 2 April 2018, Abiy was confirmed and sworn in by the Ethiopian parliament as [[Prime Minister of Ethiopia]]. During his acceptance speech, he promised political reform; to promote the unity of Ethiopia and unity among the peoples of Ethiopia; to reach out to the Eritrean government to resolve the ongoing Eritrean–Ethiopian border conflict after the [[Eritrean–Ethiopian War]] and to also reach out to the political opposition inside and outside of Ethiopia. His acceptance speech sparked optimism and received an overwhelmingly positive reaction from the Ethiopian public including the opposition groups inside and outside Ethiopia. Following his speech, his popularity and support across the country reached a historical high and some political observers argued that Abiy was overwhelmingly more popular than the ruling party coalition, the EPRDF.<ref name="chair" />

On 30 May 2018, it was announced the ruling party would amend the country's "draconian" anti-terrorism law, widely perceived as a tool of political repression. On 1 June 2018, Abiy announced the government would seek to end the state of emergency two months in advance of the expiration its six-month tenure, citing an improved domestic situation. On 4 June 2018, Parliament approved the necessary legislation, ending the state of emergency.<ref name="end_of_SOE" /> In his first briefing to the [[House of Peoples' Representatives]] in June 2018, Abiy countered criticism of his government's release of convicted "terrorists" which according to the opposition is just a name the [[EPRDF]] gives you if you are a part or even meet the "opposition".

During the national celebration on 20 June 2018, the president of Eritrea, [[Isaias Afwerki]], accepted the peace initiative put forward by Abiy and suggested that he would send a delegation to Addis Ababa.

===== Calls to revoke Nobel Peace Prize =====

In a speech to assembled Ethiopian ambassadors in January 2019, Abiy Ahmed made a prescient remark regarding sexual violence in war.

Alluding to the role of soldiers during the battle of Adua in 1896 and later, during the Eritrean war, Abiy said: “This hasn't been researched, but it's obvious. From the battle of Adwa during the time of Menelik, to the later wars, many people from central Ethiopia – Oromos, Amharas – have been going to Tigray to fight. They were there for the war with Eritrea, and there's been a military presence in Tigray for the 30 years since. So, if you're wondering what the proportion of Oromo in Tigray is, leave it for DNA to find out.

When he ordered the army’s assault on the breakaway Tigray region in November, he blocked the internet, shut out aid agencies and banned journalists.

[[File:Abiy Ahmed parade 2019.jpg|thumb|Abiy with military commanders in February 2019]]
In June 2018, Abiy, speaking to senior commanders of the [[Ethiopian National Defense Force]] (ENDF) declared his intention to carry out reforms of the military to strengthen its effectiveness and professionalism, with the view of limiting its role in politics. This followed renewed calls both within Ethiopia and from international human rights groups, namely [[Amnesty International]], to dissolve highly controversial regional militias such as the [[Liyyu]] force.<ref name="military_reform">{{cite web |last1=Mumbere |first1=Daniel |title=Ethiopia PM wants a more professional army, equipped for modern warfare |url=http://www.africanews.com/2018/06/02/ethiopia-pm-wants-a-more-professional-army-equipped-for-modern-warfare// |access-date=5 June 2018 |website=Africa News |date=2 June 2018}}</ref> This move is considered likely to face resistance from [[TPLF]] hardliners, who occupy much of the military high command.<ref name="rally_PM">{{cite web |last1=Woldegiorgis |first1=Dawit |title=Let Us Rally Around PM Abiy Ahmed for a Peaceful Transition |url=https://ecadforum.com/2018/05/31/ethiopia-let-us-rally-around-pm-abiy-ahmed-for-a-peaceful-transition/ |access-date=5 June 2018 |website=ECAD Forum |date=31 May 2018}}</ref>

=== Grenade attack ===

A large peaceful demonstration was organized in Addis Ababa at [[Meskel Square]] on 23 June 2018 to show support for the new prime minister. Just after Abiy had finished addressing the crowd a grenade was thrown and landed just 17 metres away from where he and other top officials were sitting. Two people were killed and over 165 were injured. Following the attack, 9 police officials were detained, including the deputy police commissioner, Girma Kassa, who was fired immediately. Questions were asked as to how a police car carrying attackers got so close to the prime minister and soon after the car was set alight destroying evidence. After the attack the prime minister addressed the nation on national TV unhurt by the blast and describing it as an "unsuccessful attempt by forces who do not want to see Ethiopia united". On the same day the prime minister made an unannounced visit to the Black Lion general hospital to meet victims of the attack.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ahmed |first1=Hadra |title=Explosion Hits Rally for Ethiopian Leader |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/23/world/africa/ethiopia-explosion-abiy.html |access-date=23 June 2018 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=23 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/06/ethiopia-pm-abiy-ahmed-killed-addis-ababa-blast-rally-180623075418193.html |title=Ethiopia: Grenade attack caused blast at rally for PM Abiy Ahmed |date=23 June 2018 |website=Al Jazeera |access-date=24 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-44586187 |title=Lethal grenade attack at Ethiopia rally |date=23 June 2018 |website=BBC News |access-date=24 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-politics/twenty-people-in-court-in-ethiopia-following-grenade-attack-idUSKBN1JL0V8 |title=Twenty people in court in Ethiopia following grenade attack |date=25 June 2018 |website=Reuters| access-date=27 June 2018}}</ref>

=== Political party reform ===

On 21 November 2019, upon approval of [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front|EPRDF ruling coalition]], a new party, [[Prosperity Party]], is formed via merging of three of the four parties that made up the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF) and other five affiliate parties. The parties include the [[Oromo Democratic Party]] (ODP), the [[Southern Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement]] (SEPDM), the [[Amhara Democratic Party]] (ADP), the [[Hareri National League|Harari National League]] (HNL), the [[Ethiopian Somali People's Democratic Party|Ethiopian Somali Peoples Democratic Party]] (ESPDP), the [[Afar National Democratic Party]] (ANDP), the Gambella Peoples Unity Party&nbsp;(GPUP), and the Benishangul Gumuz Peoples Democratic Party (BGPDP). The programs and bylaws of the newly merged party were first approved by the executive committee of EPRDF. Abiy believes that "Prosperity Party is committed to strengthening & applying a true Federal system which recognizes the diversity and contributions of all Ethiopians".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-politics-idUSKBN1XV24H|title=Ethiopia's ruling coalition agrees to form single party ahead of 2020 vote|date=21 November 2019|work=Reuters|access-date=2 January 2020}}</ref>

In early November 2020, an [[Tigray War|armed conflict]] began after [[4 November Northern Command attacks|4 November Northern Command Attacks]] by TPLF security forces, prompting the ENDF to engage in war. The ENDF is supported by [[Eritrean Defence Forces|Eritrean Defence Force]], [[Amhara Region|Amhara]] and [[Afar Region]] special force with other regional forces, while TPLF was aided by Tigray Special Force and [[Tigray Defense Force]].<ref name="france24_ref_1">{{cite web|url=https://www.france24.com/en/africa/20201205-ethiopia-we-are-in-our-homeland-the-invaders-are-attacking-us-says-tigray-s-gebremichael |title=Ethiopia: 'We are in our homeland, the invaders are attacking us,' says Tigray's Gebremichael| quote=As fighting continues "in many parts" of Ethiopia's Tigra, according to the United Nations, Tigray's regional president Debretsion Gebremichael told FRANCE 24 that the northern region would continue fighting as long as federal "invaders" are on Tigrayan soil. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed announced military operations in the northern region of Tigray a month ago, saying they targeted the leaders of its ruling party, the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). Gebremichael believes neighbouring Eritrea is playing a key role in the conflict. "They already have 16 divisions in Tigray. They are fighting on the side of the federal army... They have a united front against us. Wherever you go, they are there." "We are in our homeland, the invaders are attacking us, by air or by artillery fire." Gebremichael also claimed that Eritrean forces had taken part in mass lootings, a report denied by both Eritrea and Ethiopia. “They have taken laboratory equipment, computers, books. They have gone to one factory of medicine," Gebremichael told FRANCE 24's Nicolas Germain. The month-long conflict has claimed thousands of lives, according to the International Crisis Group (ICG), and tens of thousands of refugees have streamed across the border into Sudan. The UN has been warning of a possible humanitarian catastrophe within Tigray, though a communications blackout has made it difficult to assess conditions on the ground. |website=[[France 24]] |date=15 December 2020}}</ref><ref name="Reuters">{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-conflict/ethiopia-sends-army-into-tigray-region-heavy-fighting-reported-idUSKBN27K0ZS?il=0|title=Ethiopia sends army into Tigray region, heavy fighting reported|work=Reuters|date=4 November 2020 |last1=Paravicini|first1=Giulia|last2=Endeshaw|first2=Dawit|access-date=4 November 2020|archive-date=19 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201119083250/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-conflict/ethiopia-sends-army-into-tigray-region-heavy-fighting-reported-idUSKBN27K0ZS?il=0|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Reutersnews">{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/ethiopia-conflict-eritrea/exclusive-u-s-thinks-eritrea-has-joined-ethiopian-war-diplomats-say-idUSKBN28I1OX|title=Exclusive: U.S. thinks Eritrea has joined Ethiopian war, diplomats say|work=Reuters|date=8 December 2020}}</ref><ref name="Reutersnews2">{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/ethiopia-conflict-eritrea-usa-exclusive/exclusive-u-s-says-reports-of-eritrean-troops-in-ethiopias-tigray-are-credible-idUSKBN28L05Q|title=Exclusive: U.S. says reports of Eritrean troops in Ethiopia's Tigray are 'credible'|website=[[Reuters]]|quote=The United States believes reports of Eritrean military involvement in the conflict in Ethiopia's Tigray region are “credible,” a State Department spokesperson told Reuters on Thursday, despite denials by both nations.

About 2.3 million children are cut off from desperately needed aid and humanitarian assistance, said the United Nations. The Ethiopian federal government has made strict control of access to the Tigray region (since the start of the conflict), and the UN said it is frustrated that talks with the Ethiopian government have not yet brought humanitarian access. These include, "food, including ready-to-use therapeutic food for the treatment of child malnutrition, medicines, water, fuel and other essentials that are running low" said [[UNICEF]].<ref name="UNICEF_1">{{cite web|url=https://www.unicef.org/press-releases/millions-children-tigray-remain-out-reach-despite-access-agreement-unicef |title=Millions of children in Tigray remain out of reach, despite access agreement – UNICEF| quote=Some 2.3 million children in Tigray, Ethiopia, remain cut off from humanitarian assistance amid continuing violence since the beginning of November.We are extremely concerned that the longer access to them is delayed, the worse their situation will become as supplies of food, including ready-to-use therapeutic food for the treatment of child malnutrition, medicines, water, fuel and other essentials run low.

We have information that refugee camps will run out of food by the end of this week," said Germany's UN ambassador Christoph Heusgen after the meeting. "We have information that refugees are prevented from fleeing to Sudan... There are also reports that Eritrean soldiers appear to control some movement of refugees in the Eritrean border region.

According to diplomats, China and African members of the Security Council – South Africa, Niger and Tunisia – opposed the publication of a statement on Tigray requested by Germany, Estonia and the Dominican Republic.

Within this Guerrilla conflict, civilians will inevitably be caught in the crossfire as fighting will likely be most prominent in civilian areas. Before further potential violence ensues, both the TPLF and Ethiopian government should recognize that the protection of civilians in this conflict is paramount and employ necessary measures to ensure civilian safety, including stopping indiscriminate bombardments, putting military facilities near civilian areas and targeting civilian facilities. Both sides should also grant unobstructed access to humanitarian organizations that can provide aid and supplies for those in need and restore communication channels to ensure transparency by both groups.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Chatterjee |first1=Pallavi |title=Premature laurels, precarious commitment: The unfortunate trend of Nobel Peace Prize laureates who violate peace itself |url=https://www.humanrightspulse.com/mastercontentblog/premature-laurels-precarious-commitment-the-unfortunate-trend-of-nobel-peace-prize-laureates-who-violate-peace-itself |website=Human Rights Pulse |access-date=12 April 2021 |date=15 January 2021 |quote=It is unfortunate that the mainstay of political leaders is to balance out multiple, often conflicting, interests of different, often conflicting, stakeholders.
