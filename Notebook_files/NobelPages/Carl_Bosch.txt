==Biography==

===Early years===
Carl Bosch was born in [[Cologne]], Germany, to a successful gas and plumbing supplier.<ref name="hager">{{Cite book|title = The alchemy of air|last = Hager|first = Thomas|publisher = Harmony Books|year = 2008|isbn = 978-0-307-35178-4|location = New York|oclc = 191318130}}</ref>  His father was [[Carl Friedrich Alexander Bosch]] (1843–1904) and his uncle was [[Robert Bosch]], who pioneered the development of the [[spark plug]] and founded the multinational company [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]]. Carl, trying to decide between a career in metallurgy or chemistry, studied at the ''Königlich [[Technische Hochschule]] [[Charlottenburg]]'' (now the [[Technical University of Berlin]]) and the [[University of Leipzig]] from 1892 to 1898. {{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

===Career===
[[Image:IGFarbenGoetterrat.jpg|thumb|300px|Painting by [[Hermann Groeber]]: ''Der Aufsichtsrat der 1925 gegründeten I.G. Farben AG'', Carl Bosch and [[Carl Duisberg]] (in front sitting), [[Edmund ter Meer]] (third person from right with newspaper)]]
Carl Bosch attended the University of Leipzig, and this is where he studied under [[Johannes Wislicenus]],<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Carl-Bosch|title=Carl Bosch {{!}} German chemist|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-12-09|language=en}}</ref> and he obtained his doctorate in 1898 for research in organic chemistry. After he left in 1899 he took an entry-level job at [[BASF]], then Germany's largest chemical and dye firm. From 1909 until 1913 he transformed [[Fritz Haber]]'s tabletop demonstration of a method to fix nitrogen using [[high-pressure chemistry]] through the [[Haber–Bosch process]] to produce synthetic nitrate, a process that has countless industrial applications for making a near-infinite variety of industrial compounds, consumer goods, and commercial products. His primary contribution was to expand the scale of the process, enabling the industrial production of vast quantities of synthetic nitrate. To do this, he had to construct a plant and equipment that would function effectively under high gas pressures and high temperatures. {{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

Bosch was also responsible for finding a more practical catalyst than the [[osmium]] and [[uranium]] being used by Haber. As Osmium was a very limited resource, and uranium very expensive.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bosch |first1=Carl |title=The development of the chemical high pressure method during the establishment of the new ammonia industry |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/bosch-lecture.pdf |access-date=17 November 2019}}</ref>

There were many more obstacles as well, such as designing large compressors and safe high-pressure furnaces.  A means was needed to provide pure hydrogen gas in quantity as the [[feedstock]]. Also, cheap and safe means had to be developed to clean and process the product [[ammonia]]. The first full-scale Haber–Bosch plant was erected in Oppau, Germany, now part of [[Ludwigshafen]].  With the process complete he was able to synthesize large amounts of ammonia, which was available for the industrial and agricultural fields. In fact, this production has increased the agricultural yields throughout the world.<ref name="hager"/> This work won him the Nobel prize for Chemistry in 1931.<ref name="Nobel Prize Bio" />

After [[World War I]] Bosch extended high-pressure techniques to the production of [[synthetic fuel]] via the [[Bergius process]] and [[methanol]]. In 1925 Bosch helped found [[IG Farben]], and was the first head of the company. From 1935, Bosch was chairman of the board of directors.

He received the [[Siemens-Ring]] in 1924 for his contributions to applied research and his support of basic research. In 1931 he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] together with [[Friedrich Bergius]] for the introduction of high pressure chemistry. Today the Haber–Bosch process produces 100 million tons of nitrogen fertilizer every year.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title = Carl Bosch (German chemist)|encyclopedia = Encyclopædia Britannica |url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/74581/Carl-Bosch|access-date = 2013-12-15<!-- archived June 2013 at https://archive.today/20130628202349/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/74581/Carl-Bosch -->}}</ref>

==Personal life==

Bosch married Else Schilback in 1902. Carl and Else had a son and a daughter together. Bosch, a critic of many Nazi policies, was gradually relieved of his high positions after Hitler became chancellor, and fell into depression and alcoholism.<ref name=hager/> He died in [[Heidelberg]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2019}}

==Legacy==
The Haber–Bosch Process today consumes more than one percent of humanity's energy production and is responsible for feeding roughly one-third of its population.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Enriching the earth|last = Smil|first = Vaclav|publisher = MIT Press|year = 2001|location = Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc = 61678151}}</ref> On average, one-half of the nitrogen in a human body comes from synthetically fixed sources, the product of a Haber–Bosch plant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00dzl8p|title=Fixing the Nitrogen Fix, Can Chemistry Save The World?, Discovery - BBC World Service|website=BBC|access-date=2016-08-27}}</ref> Bosch was an ardent collector of insects, minerals, and gems.

Carl Bosch along with Fritz Haber were voted the world's most influential chemical engineers of all time by members of the Institution of Chemical Engineers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icheme.org/media_centre/news/2011/haber%20and%20bosch%20named%20top%20chemical%20engineers.aspx |title=Haber and Bosch named top chemical engineers |publisher=Institution of Chemical Engineers |date=2011-02-21 |access-date=2013-12-15<!-- archived June 2012 at https://archive.today/20120629061631/http://www.icheme.org/media_centre/news/2011/haber%20and%20bosch%20named%20top%20chemical%20engineers.aspx%23.T-1IOKgo_KA --> |website=IChemE.org |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005012711/http://www.icheme.org/media_centre/news/2011/haber%20and%20bosch%20named%20top%20chemical%20engineers.aspx |archive-date=2013-10-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The [[Haber–Bosch process]], quite possibly the best-known chemical process in the world, which captures nitrogen from the air and converts it to ammonia, has its hand in the process of the [[Green Revolution]] that has been feeding the increasing population of the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcetoday.com/chemical%20engineers%20who%20changed%20the%20world.aspx |title=Chemical engineers who changed the world |at=2010 Entries: Feed the world |date=March 2010 |publisher=Institution of Chemical Engineers |website=tce today |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320142112/http://www.tcetoday.com/chemical%20engineers%20who%20changed%20the%20world.aspx |archive-date=2011-03-20 }}</ref>

Bosch also won numerous awards including an honorary doctorate from [[Karlsruhe University of Applied Sciences|Hochschule Karlsruhe]] (1918), the Liebig Memorial Medal of the Association of German Chemists along with the Bunsen Medal of the German Bunsen Society, the Siemens Ring, and the Golden Grashof Memorial medal of the VDI. In 1931 he was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry for the contribution to the invention of chemical high pressure methods.  He also received the Exner medal from the Austrian Trade Association and the Carl Lueg Memorial Medal.  Bosch also enjoyed his membership of various German and foreign scientific academics, and his chairmanship of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society of which he became the President in 1937.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://humantouchofchemistry.com/carl-bosch.htm |title=Famous Scientists - Carl Bosch |publisher=Tata Chemicals |access-date=2013-12-15 |website=The Human Touch of Chemistry<!-- archived June 2013 at https://archive.today/20130629114601/http://humantouchofchemistry.com/carl-bosch.htm --> |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130629114601/http://humantouchofchemistry.com/carl-bosch.htm |archive-date=2013-06-29 }}</ref>
