'''Alfred Kastler''' ({{IPA-fr|kastlɛʁ|lang}}; 3 May 1902 – 7 January 1984) was a [[French people|French]] [[physicist]], and [[Nobel Prize for Physics|Nobel Prize laureate]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Happer, William|author-link=William Happer|title=Obituary: Alfred Kastler|journal=Physics Today|date=May 1984|volume=37|issue=5|pages=101–102|url=http://www.physicstoday.org/resource/1/phtoad/v37/i5/p101_s1?bypassSSO=1|doi=10.1063/1.2916219|bibcode=1984PhT....37e.101H}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==Biography==
Kastler was born in [[Guebwiller]] ([[Alsace-Lorraine|Alsace]], [[German Empire]]) and later attended the [[Lycée]] Bartholdi in [[Colmar, Alsace]], and [[École Normale Supérieure]] in Paris in 1921. After his studies, in 1926 he began teaching [[physics]] at the Lycée of [[Mulhouse]], and then taught at the [[University of Bordeaux]], where he was a university professor until 1941. Georges Bruhat asked him to come back to the École Normale Supérieure, where he finally obtained a chair in 1952.

Collaborating with [[Jean Brossel]], he researched [[quantum mechanics]], the interaction between [[light]] and [[atom]]s, and [[spectroscopy]]. Kastler, working on combination of [[optical resonator|optical resonance]] and [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|magnetic resonance]], developed the technique of "[[optical pumping]]". Those works led to the completion of the theory of [[laser]]s and [[maser]]s.

He won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1966 "for the discovery and development of optical methods for studying Hertzian resonances in atoms".

He was president of the board of the Institut d'optique théorique et appliquée and served as the first chairman of the [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) [[Action Against Hunger]].

Kastler also wrote poetry (in [[German language|German]]). In 1971 he published ''Europe, ma patrie: Deutsche Lieder eines französischen Europäers'' (i.e. ''Europe, my fatherland: German songs of a French European'').

In 1978 he became foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00001214 |title=A.H.F.

In 1979, Kastler was awarded the [[Wilhelm Exner Medal]].<ref>Editor, ÖGV. (2015). Wilhelm Exner Medal. Austrian Trade Association. ÖGV. Austria.</ref>

Professor Kastler spent most of his research career at the Ecole Normale Supérieure in Paris where he started after the war with his student, Jean Brossel a small research group on spectroscopy.

Over the forty years that followed, this group has trained many of young physicists and had a significant impact on the development of the science of [[atomic physics]] in [[France]]. The Laboratoire de Spectroscopie hertzienne  has then been renamed [[Laboratoire Kastler-Brossel]] in 1994 and has got a part of its laboratory in [[Université Pierre et Marie Curie]]  mainly at the [[École Normale Supérieure]].

Professor Kastler died on 7 January 1984, in [[Bandol]], France.<ref>{{cite news |title=Dr. Alfred Kastler, 81, Nobel Prize-Winner, Dies |first=Walter |last=Sullivan |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/01/08/obituaries/dr-alfred-kastler-81-nobel-prize-winner-dies.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=8 January 1984 |access-date=2010-11-06 }}</ref>
