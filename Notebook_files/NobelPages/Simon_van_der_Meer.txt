'''Simon van der Meer''' (24 November 1925{{spaced ndash}}4 March 2011) was a Dutch [[Accelerator physics|particle accelerator physicist]] who shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1984 with [[Carlo Rubbia]] for contributions to the [[CERN]] project which led to the discovery of the [[W and Z bosons|W and Z particles]], the two fundamental communicators of the weak interaction.<ref name="nobelcitation">

==Biography==
One of four children, Simon van der Meer was born and grew up in [[The Hague]], the Netherlands, in a family of teachers.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/science-obituaries/8371741/Simon-van-der-Meer.html|title=Obituary: Simon Van der Meer|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|date=9 March 2011|access-date=10 March 2011}}</ref> He was educated at the city's [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]], graduating in 1943 during the German occupation of the Netherlands.  He studied Technical Physics at the [[Delft University of Technology]], and received an [[engineer's degree]] in 1952. After working for [[Philips Natuurkundig Laboratorium|Philips Research]] in [[Eindhoven]] on high-voltage equipment for electron microscopy for a few years, he joined [[CERN]] in 1956 where he stayed until his retirement in 1990.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Telegdi|first1=Val|title=Simon van der Meer retires|journal=CERN Courier|date=January 1991|volume=31|issue=1|pages=14–15|url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/1731850}}</ref><ref>{{Nobelprize|accessed=27 April 2020</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Caspers|first1=Fritz|last2=Koziol|first2=Heribert|last3=Mohl|first3=Dieter|title=Simon van der Meer: a quiet giant of engineering and physics|journal=CERN Courier|date=June 2011|volume=51|issue=5|pages=24–27|url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/1734665}}</ref>

Van der Meer was a relative of Nobel Prize winner [[Tjalling Koopmans]] – they were [[first cousins once removed#1stOnceRem|first cousins once removed]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.familyaffairs.nl/UK/FamousData/Koopmans.html |title=Ancestors of Tjalling Koopmans |date=2010 |publisher=Family Affairs |access-date=18 March 2017 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Tussen observatie en participatie: twee eeuwen gereformeerde en antirevolutionaire wereld in ontwikkelingsperspectief|language=nl |author=D.Th.

==Work at CERN==
In the 1950s, Van der Meer designed magnets for the 28 GeV [[Proton Synchrotron]] (PS)<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chohan|first1=Vinod C|title=Simon van der Meer (1925-2011): A modest genius of accelerator science|journal=Rev. Accel. Sci. Technol.|date=2011|volume=4|issue=1|pages=279–291|doi=10.1142/S1793626811000550|bibcode=2011rast.book..279C}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Chohan|first1=Vinod|title=Simon van der Meer and his legacy to CERN and particle accelerators|date=2012|publisher=CERN|location=Geneva|pages=28|url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/1499428?ln=en|isbn=9789290833833|series=CERN Yellow Reports: Monographs|author1-link=Vinod Chohan}}</ref> In 1961, he invented a pulsed focusing device, known as the ‘van der Meer horn’. Such devices are necessary for long-base-line neutrino facilities and are used even today.

That was followed in the 1960s by the design of a small storage ring for a physics experiment studying the anomalous magnetic moment of the [[muon]]. Soon after and in the following decade, Van der Meer did some very innovative work on the regulation and control of powersupplies for the [[Intersecting Storage Rings]] (ISR) and, later, the [[Super Proton Synchrotron|SPS]].

Van der Meer's ISR Collider days in the 1970s led to his technique for luminosity calibration of colliding beams, first used at the ISR and still used today at the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]], as well as in other colliders.

The Nobel Prize committee recognised van der Meer's idea of [[stochastic cooling]] and its application at CERN in the late 1970s and 1980s, specifically in the [[Antiproton Accumulator]], which supplied [[antiproton]]s to the [[Proton-Antiproton Collider]].

During his work at the ISR, van der Meer developed a technique using steering magnets to vertically displace the two colliding beams with respect to each other; this permitted the evaluation of the effective beam height, leading to an evaluation of the beam luminosity at an intersection point. The famous ‘van der Meer scans’ are indispensable even today in the LHC experiments; without these, the precision of the calibration of the luminosity at the intersection points in the Collider would be much lower.

For the new [[Super Proton Synchrotron|SPS]] machine constructed in the early seventies, he proposed that the generation of the reference voltages for the bending and quadrupole supplies should be based on measurements of the field along the cycle, and gave an outline of the correction algorithms. His proposal resulted in the first ever computer-controlled closed-loop system for a geographically distributed system, as the 7&nbsp;km circumference SPS was; this was a no simple feat for the early 1970s. Measurements of the main magnet currents were introduced only later, when the SPS had to run as a storage ring for the SPS p–pbar collider.

Van der Meer's accelerator knowledge and computer programming meant he developed very sophisticated applications and tools to control the antiproton source accelerators as well as the transfer of antiprotons to the SPS Collider for Nobel-winning discoveries. The AA and AC pbar source complex machines remained from 1987 to 1996 the most highly automated set of machines in CERN's repertoire of accelerators.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chohan|first1=Vinod|last2=Van der Meer|first2=Simon|title=Aspects of automation and applications in the CERN antiproton source|journal=CERN|volume=293|issue=1–2|date=December 1989|pages=98|url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/204708?ln=en|bibcode=1990NIMPA.293...98C|doi=10.1016/0168-9002(90)91408-4|author1-link=Vinod Chohan}}</ref>

==Nobel prize==
Van der Meer invented the technique of [[stochastic cooling]] of particle beams.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1984/press.html Nobel Press Release]. Nobelprize.org (17 October 1984). Retrieved on 3 April 2014.</ref> His technique was used to accumulate intense beams of [[antiproton]]s for head-on collision with counter-rotating [[proton]] beams at 540 GeV centre-of-mass energy or 270 GeV per beam in the [[Super Proton Synchrotron]] at [[CERN]]. Such collisions produced [[W and Z bosons]] which could be detected for the first time in 1983 by the [[UA1 experiment]], led by [[Carlo Rubbia]]. The W and Z bosons had been theoretically predicted some years earlier, and their experimental discovery was considered a significant success for CERN. Van der Meer and Rubbia shared the 1984 [[Nobel Prize]] for their decisive contributions to the project.<ref>''[[The Economist]]'', "[http://www.economist.com/node/18385864?story_id=18385864 Simon van der Meer]", 19 March 2011, p. 96.</ref> <br>

Van der Meer and [[Ernest Lawrence]] are the only two accelerator physicists who have won the Nobel prize.

Apart from his Nobel Prize Van der Meer also became a member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1984.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00009290 |title=Simon van der Meer (1925 - 2011) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |access-date=24 January 2016}}</ref>
