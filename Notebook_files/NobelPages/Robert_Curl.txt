== Early life and education ==
Born in [[Alice, Texas]], United States, Curl was the son of a [[Methodist]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name="Carey">{{cite book|last1=Carey|first1=Charles W.

Curl received a [[Bachelor of Science]] from [[Rice University|Rice Institute]] (now Rice University) in 1954.<ref name=":0" />  He was attracted to the reputation of both the school's academics and football team, and the fact that at the time it charged no tuition.<ref name=":4" />  He earned his [[doctorate]] in chemistry from the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1957.<ref name=":0">[http://www.nndb.com/people/798/000100498/ Robert F. Curl, Jr<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> At Berkeley, he worked in the laboratory of [[Kenneth Pitzer]], then dean of the College of Chemistry, with whom he would become a lifelong collaborator.  Curl's graduate research involved performing [[infrared spectroscopy]] to determine the [[bond angle]] of [[disiloxane]].<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":4" />

==Scientific career==
Curl was a postdoctoral fellow at [[Harvard University]] with [[Edgar Bright Wilson|E. B. Wilson]], where he used [[microwave spectroscopy]] to study the [[bond rotation barrier]]s of molecules.<ref name=":4" />  After that, he joined the faculty of Rice University in 1958.<ref name=":1" /> He inherited the equipment and graduate students of [[George Bird (scientist)|George Bird]], a professor who was leaving for a job at [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]].<ref name=":2" />  Curl's early research involved the microwave spectroscopy of [[chlorine dioxide]].<ref name=":4" />  His research program included both experiment and theory, mainly focused on detection and analysis of [[free radical]]s using microwave spectroscopy and tunable lasers.  He used these observations to develop the theory of their [[fine structure]] and [[hyperfine structure]], as well as information about their structure and the kinetics of their reactions.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url = http://chemistry.rice.edu/FacultyDetail.aspx?RiceID=589|title = Robert F.

== Nobel Prize ==
Curl's research at Rice involved the fields of infrared and microwave spectroscopy.<ref name=":1" />  Curl's research inspired Richard Smalley to come to Rice in 1976 with the intention of collaborating with Curl.<ref name=":6">{{cite web|title=Richard E. Smalley, Robert F. Curl, Jr., and Harold W. Kroto|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/richard-smalley-robert-curl-harold-kroto|website=Science History Institute |access-date=21 March 2018|date=June 2016}}</ref>  In 1985, Curl was contacted by Harold Kroto, who wanted to use a laser beam apparatus built by Smalley to simulate and study the formation of [[Polyyne|carbon chains]] in [[red giant]] stars. Smalley and Curl had previously used this apparatus to study [[semiconductor]]s such as [[silicon]] and [[germanium]].<ref name=":1" /> They were initially reluctant to interrupt their experiments on these semiconductor materials to use their apparatus for Kroto's experiments on carbon, but eventually gave in.<ref name=":6" />

They indeed found the long carbon chains they were looking for, but also found an unexpected product that had 60 carbon atoms.<ref name=":6" />  Over the course of 11 days, the team studied and determined its structure and named it [[buckminsterfullerene]] after noting its similarity to the [[geodesic dome]]s for which the architect [[Buckminster Fuller]] was known.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Robert F.

Heath]] and [[Sean C. O'Brien]] deserve equal recognition in the work to Smalley and Kroto.<ref name=":4" />  The existence of this type of molecule had earlier been theorized by others, but Curl and his colleagues were at the time unaware of this.  Later experiments confirmed their proposed structure, and the team moved on to synthesize [[endohedral fullerene]]s that had a metal atom inside the hollow carbon shell.<ref name=":7" /><ref name="NobelBio">{{cite web|title=Robert F.

Kroto, J. R. Heath, S. C. O’Brien,  and R. E. Smalley, was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society, presented to Rice University in 2015.<ref name="Award"/><ref name="Breakthrough"/> The discovery of fullerenes was recognized in 2010 by the designation of a [[National Historic Chemical Landmarks|National Historic Chemical Landmark]] by the [[American Chemical Society]] at the Richard E. Smalley Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology at Rice University in Houston, Texas.<ref name="ChemLandmark"/>

After winning the Nobel Prize in 1996, Curl took a quieter path than Smalley, who became an outspoken advocate of nanotechnology, and Kroto, who used his fame to further his interest in science education, saying, "After winning a Nobel, you can either become a scientific pontificator, or you can have some idea for a new science project and you can use your newfound notoriety to get the resources to do it. Or you can say, 'Well, I enjoy what I was doing, and I want to keep doing that.'"<ref name=":2" />

== Later research ==
Curl's later research interests involved [[physical chemistry]], developing [[DNA]] genotyping and sequencing instrumentation, and creating [[Photoacoustic spectroscopy|photoacoustic]] sensors for [[trace gas]]es using [[quantum cascade laser]]s.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/146968/Robert-F-Curl-Jr|title = Robert F.
