'''Vincent du Vigneaud''' (May 18, 1901 – December 11, 1978) was an American [[biochemist]]. He was recipient of the 1955 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] "for his work on biochemically important sulphur compounds, especially for the first synthesis of a polypeptide hormone,"<ref name = 1955Nobel>{{cite web|title = The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1955|website = Nobelprize.org|url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1955/index.html|access-date = 17 November 2016|publisher = [[Nobel Media AB]]}}</ref> a reference to his work on the [[peptide hormone]] [[oxytocin]].<ref name = oxytocinTS>{{cite journal|title = The Synthesis of Oxytocin|last1 = du Vigneaud|first1 = Vincent|author-link1 = Vincent du Vigneaud|last2 = Ressler|first2 = Charlotte|last3 = Swan|first3 = John M.|last4 = Roberts|first4 = Carleton W.|last5 = Katsoyannis|first5 = Panayotis G.|journal = [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]]|volume = 76|issue = 12|pages = 3115–3121|year = 1954|doi = 10.1021/ja01641a004}}</ref>

==Biography==
Vincent du Vigneaud was born in [[Chicago]] in 1901 and graduated from [[Schurz High School]] in 1918. He began studying chemistry at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], where he was influenced by lectures of [[Carl Shipp Marvel]]. After receiving his [[Master of Science|MS]] in 1924 he joined [[DuPont]].

He married Zella Zon Ford on June 12, 1924. Restarting his academic career in 1925, du Vigneaud joined the group of [[John R. Murlin]] at the [[University of Rochester]] for his PhD [[thesis]]. He graduated in 1927 with his work ''The Sulfur of Insulin''.

After a post-doctoral position with [[John Jacob Abel]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]] Medical School (1927–1928), he traveled to Europe as National Research Council Fellow in 1928-1929, where he worked with [[Max Bergmann]] and [[Leonidas Zervas]] at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Leather Research]] in [[Dresden]], and with [[George Barger]] at the [[University of Edinburgh Medical School]]. He then returned to the [[University of Illinois]] as a professor.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hofmann|first=Klaus|title=Vincent du Vigneaud|url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/du-vigneaud-vincent.pdf|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|access-date=20 September 2012}}</ref>

In 1932 he started working at the [[George Washington University]] Medical School in [[Washington, D.C.]]  and in 1938 at the [[Cornell Medical College]] in New York City, where he stayed until his [[emeritus|emeritation]] in 1967. Following retirement, he held a position at [[Cornell University]] in [[Ithaca, New York]].

In 1974 du Vigneaud suffered from a stroke which prevented him from resuming his academic career. He died in 1978, one year after his wife's death in 1977.

==Career==
His career was characterized by an interest in sulfur-containing peptides, proteins, and especially [[peptide hormone]]s. Even before his Nobel-Prize-winning work<ref name = 1955Nobel /> on elucidating and synthesizing [[oxytocin]]<ref name = oxytocinTS /> and [[vasopressin]] via manipulating the [[AVP gene]], he had established a reputation from his research on [[insulin]], [[biotin]], [[transmethylation]], and [[penicillin]].<ref>{{Cite news |pmid=17554806 |last=Ragnarsson |first=Ulf |publication-date=Jul 2007 |year=2007 |title=The Nobel trail of Vincent du Vigneaud |volume=13 |issue=7 |pages=431–3 |doi=10.1002/psc.864 |journal=[[Journal of Peptide Science]]}}</ref>

He also carried out a series of structure-activity relationships for oxytocin and vasopressin, perhaps the first of their type for peptides. That work culminated in the publication of a book entitled ''A Trail of Research in Sulphur Chemistry and Metabolism and Related Field''.

==Legacy==
He joined [[Alpha Chi Sigma]] while at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] in 1930.
