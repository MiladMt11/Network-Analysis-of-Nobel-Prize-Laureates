'''Rosalyn Sussman Yalow''' (July 19, 1921 – May 30, 2011) was an American [[medical physics|medical physicist]], and a co-winner of the 1977 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] (together with [[Roger Guillemin]] and [[Andrew Schally]]) for development of the [[radioimmunoassay]] technique. She was the second woman (after [[Gerty Cori]]), and the first American-born woman, to be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8553122/Rosalyn-Yalow.html Obituary in ''The Telegraph'']</ref><ref name="Bonolis">{{cite web |last1=Bonolis |first1=Luisa |title=Research Profile – Rosalyn Yalow |url=https://www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org/research-profile/laureate-yalow |website=Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings |access-date=31 August 2018}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Childhood===
Rosalyn Sussman Yalow was born in the Bronx, New York, the daughter of Clara (née Zipper) and Simon Sussman, and was raised in a Jewish household. She went to [[Walton High School (Bronx)]], [[New York City]]. After high school, she attended the all-female, tuition-free [[Hunter College]], where her mother hoped she would learn to become a teacher. Instead, Yalow decided to study physics.{{Quote box|width=30%|quote=I was excited about achieving a career in physics. My family, being more practical, thought the most desirable position for me would be as an elementary school teacher.|source=Rosalyn Yalow<ref name="autobiography">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1977/yalow-autobio.html|title=Autobiography|last=Yalow|first=Rosalyn|year=1977|publisher=Nobelprize.org|access-date=October 2, 2012}}</ref>}}

===College===
Yalow knew how to type, and was able to get a part-time position as a secretary to Dr. [[Rudolf Schoenheimer]], a leading biochemist at [[Columbia University]]'s College of Physicians and Surgeons. She did not believe that any respectable graduate school would admit and financially support a woman, so she took another job as a secretary to [[Michael Heidelberger]], another biochemist at Columbia, who hired her on the condition that she studied [[stenography]]. She graduated from [[Hunter College]] in January 1941.<ref name="autobiography" />

A few years later, she received an offer to be a teaching assistant in physics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. She received this offer partially because [[World War II]] had just begun and many men went off to fight, and the University opted to offer women education and jobs to avoid being shut down. At the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], she was the only woman among the department's 400 members, and the first since 1917.<ref name="straus1999">{{cite book |last1=Straus |first1=Eugene |title=Rosalyn Yalow, Nobel Laureate: Her Life and Work in Medicine |date=1999 |publisher=Perseus Books |location=Cambridge, MA |isbn=978-0738202631 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/rosalynyalownobe00stra_0 }}</ref>{{rp|109}} Yalow earned her [[Ph.D.]] in 1945.  The next summer, she took two tuition-free physics courses under government auspices at [[New York University]].<ref name="kahn2012">{{cite journal |last1=Kahn |first1=C.

===Marriage and children===
She married fellow student Aaron Yalow, the son of a rabbi, in June 1943. They had two children, Benjamin and Elanna Yalow,  and kept a [[kosher]] home. Yalow did not believe in "balancing her career with her home life" and instead incorporated her home life wherever she could in her work life.<ref name="straus1999"/>{{rp|109}} However, she viewed the traditional roles of a homemaker as a priority, and devoted herself to traditional duties associated with motherhood and being a wife.
[[File:Rosalyn Sussman Yalow Postcard.jpg|thumb|right|A postcard honoring Rosalyn Sussman Yalow.]]
Throughout her career, she tended to shun feminist organizations, but still advocated for including more [[women in science]].<ref name="kahn2012"/> While she believed the reason she had certain opportunities in physics was because of the war, she thought that the reason that the number of women in this field decreased after the war due to a lack of interest. Yalow saw the feminist movement as a challenge to her traditional beliefs and thought that it encouraged women not to fulfill their duties to become mothers and wives.<ref name="straus1999"/>{{rp|109}}

==Scientific career==
The month after graduating from [[Hunter College]] in January 1941, Rosalyn Sussman Yalow was offered a position as a teaching assistant in the physics department of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. Gaining acceptance to the physics graduate program in the College of Engineering at the University of Illinois was one of the many hurdles she had to overcome as a woman in her field. Powerful male figures controlled opportunities for training, recognition, promotion, and many aspects of development in the field of science, and especially physics.

When Yalow entered the university in September 1941, she was the only woman in the faculty, which comprised 400 professors and teaching assistants. She was the first woman since 1917 to attend or teach at this engineering college.<ref name="anderson2017">{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=Rebecca J. |title=Breaking Barriers: The Life and Work of Rosalyn Yalow |journal=The Pharmacologist |date=September 2017 |volume=59 |issue=3 |pages=152–163 |url=https://www.aspet.org/docs/default-source/uploadedfiles/publications/v59_n3_9_2017_web.pdf}}</ref> Yalow credited her position at the prestigious graduate school to the shortage of male candidates during World War II. Being surrounded by gifted men made her aware of a wider world in science. They recognized her talent, they encouraged her, and they supported her. They were in a position to help her succeed.<ref name="straus1999"/>

Yalow felt that other women in her field did not like her because of her ambition. Other women saw her curiosity as abandoning the only acceptable path for a woman in science at the time, becoming a high school science teacher, but Yalow wanted to be a physicist.<ref name="straus1999"/> During her time at the University of Illinois, she took extra undergraduate courses to increase her knowledge because she wanted to do original experimental research in addition to her regular teaching duties.<ref name="world2003">{{cite web |title=Rosalyn Sussman Yalow |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/people/medicine/medicine-biographies/rosalyn-sussman-yalow |website=World of Microbiology and Immunology |language=en |date=2003}}</ref>

For years Yalow faced criticism from women at work but she never quit nor turned her back on other young women, if she believed they had the potential to become real scientists. She never became an advocate for women's organizations in the field of science.<ref name="world2003"/> She was even quoted as saying, "It bothers me that there are now organizations for women in science, which means they think they have to be treated differently from the men. I don't approve."<ref name="straus1999"/>{{rp|81}} Although girls and young women found a role model in her after she won her Nobel, Yalow was not a champion for improving women's treatment or representation in science.<ref name="straus1999"/>{{rp|76}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://massivesci.com/articles/science-hero-rosalyn-sussman-yalow-facts-insulin-diabetes-blood-radioimmunoassay/|title=Meet Rosalyn Sussman Yalow, the first American-born woman to win a Nobel Prize, who let doctors see into your blood|last=Harrod|first=Jordan|website=[[Massive Science]]|access-date=2019-06-20}}</ref>

Yalow's first job after teaching and taking classes at the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana graduate school was as an assistant electrical engineer at Federal Telecommunications Laboratory. She again found herself to be the only woman employee.<ref name="straus1999"/> In 1946, she returned to [[Hunter College]] to teach physics and consequently influenced many women, most notably a young [[Mildred Dresselhaus]]: Yalow was responsible for steering the future "Queen of Carbon Science" away from primary school teaching and into a research career.<ref name="Vega">{{cite web |title=Mildred Dresselhaus - Science Video |url=http://www.vega.org.uk/video/programme/20 |website=Vega Science Trust |access-date=31 August 2018}}</ref><ref name="Anderson">{{cite news |last1=Anderson |first1=Mark |title=Mildred Dresselhaus: The Queen of Carbon |url=https://spectrum.ieee.org/geek-life/profiles/mildred-dresselhaus-the-queen-of-carbon |access-date=31 August 2018 |work=IEEE Spectrum |date=April 28, 2015}}</ref> She remained a [[physics]] lecturer from 1946 to 1950, although by 1947, she began her long association with the [[Veterans Administration]] by becoming a consultant to the [[James J. Peters VA Medical Center|Bronx Veteran's Administration Hospital]].<ref name="howes2011">{{cite journal |last1=Howes |first1=Ruth H.|author-link=Ruth Howes |title=Rosalyn Sussman Yalow (1921–2011) |journal=Physics & Society |date=October 2011 |volume=40 |issue=4 |url=https://www.aps.org/units/fps/newsletters/201110/howes.cfm |language=en}}</ref>

The Veteran's Administration wanted to establish research programs to explore medical uses of radioactive substances.<ref name="anderson2017"/> By 1950, Yalow had equipped a [[radioisotope]] laboratory at the Bronx VA Hospital and decided to leave teaching to finally devote her attention to full-time research. There she collaborated with [[Solomon Berson]] to develop [[radioimmunoassay]],<ref name="straus1999"/> a radioisotope tracing technique that allows the measurement of tiny quantities of various biological substances in human blood as well as a multitude of other aqueous fluids. Originally used to study insulin levels in diabetes mellitus, the technique has since been applied to hundreds of other substances – including [[hormones]], [[vitamins]] and [[enzymes]] – all which had been present in quantities or concentrations that were previously too small to detect.<ref name="anderson2017"/> Without the contributions of Yalow to the work of accurate hormone measurement, it was impossible to diagnose various hormone-related conditions and endocrine diseases like type 1 diabetes.<ref name=unn>{{cite journal |last1=Unnikrishnan |title=The Other Insulin Story of 1921 |journal=Indian Journal of Endocrinology and Metabolism |year=2011 |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=147–148 |doi=10.4103/2230-8210.83394 |pmid=21897888 |pmc=3156531 }}</ref>

Despite its huge commercial potential, Yalow and Berson refused to patent the method. In 1968, Yalow was appointed as a research professor in the Department of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital, where she later became the Solomon Berson Distinguished Professor at Large.<ref name="howes2011"/> Yalow also had a passion for the next generation of researchers. She acted as a mentor figure to scientists from around the world, many of whom came to share her passion for investigative endocrinology research. One of these mentees, Dr. [[Narayana Panicker Kochupillai]], went on to become a leading endocrinology researcher in India, studying thyroid hormones and iodine deficiency. In this way, Yalow's legacy in endocrinology was carried on. A fitting title for Rosalyn Yalow may well be "the Mother of Endocrinology."<ref name=unn/>

The following year she became the first female recipient and first nuclear physicist of the [[Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research]]. Established by Albert and Mary Lasker in 1945, the award is intended to celebrate scientists who have made fundamental biological discoveries and clinical advances that improve human health.<ref>Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, "The Lasker Awards," Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, accessed May 14, 2018, http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards-overview/.</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award|url=http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/1976_b_description.htm|publisher=Lasker Foundation}}</ref>

In 1977, Yalow was the sixth individual woman (seventh overall, considering [[Marie Curie]]'s two wins), and first American-born woman, to win the [[Nobel Prize]] in a scientific field. She was also the second woman in the world to win in the physiology or medicine category (the first was [[Gerty Cori]]). Yalow was honored for her role in devising the [[radioimmunoassay]] technique, along with [[Roger Guillemin]] and [[Andrew V. Schally]] for their research in another field.<ref name="Bonolis"/> By measuring substances in the human body, the screening of the blood of donors for such diseases as hepatitis was made possible.<ref name="america.gov">{{cite web|url=http://www.america.gov/st/diversity-english/2008/April/20080427135047eaifas0.9798045.html|title=Rosalyn Sussman Yalow Nobel Prize winner for physiology or medicine|publisher=america.gov|access-date=June 19, 2010}}</ref> Radioimmunoassay can be used to measure a multitude of substances found in tiny quantities in fluids within and outside of organisms (such as viruses, drugs and hormones).
