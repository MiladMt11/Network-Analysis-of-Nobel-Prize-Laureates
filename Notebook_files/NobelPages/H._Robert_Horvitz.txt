'''Howard Robert Horvitz''' (born May 8, 1947) is an [[United States|American]] [[biologist]] best known for his research on the [[nematode]] worm ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'',<ref>{{cite web|first=H.

Sulston]], whose "seminal discoveries concerning the genetic regulation of organ development and programmed cell death" were "important for medical research and have shed new light on the pathogenesis of many diseases".<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2002/press-release/ Nobelprize pressrelease]</ref>

==Education and early life==
Horvitz was born in Chicago, Illinois to Jewish parents,<ref name="Haaretz-article"/> the son of Mary R. (Savit), a school teacher, and Oscar Freedom Horvitz, a GAO accountant. He majored in mathematics at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], where he joined [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]] and spent his summers working for IBM, at first wiring panels for accounting machines and then in his final summer helping to develop IBM's [[Conversational Programming System]].<ref name="Nobelprize"/>

During his senior year, Horvitz took his first courses in biology and was encouraged by his professors to continue to study biology in graduate school, despite his limited coursework in the field. After he completed his undergraduate studies in 1968, he enrolled in graduate studies in biology at [[Harvard University]], where he studied [[Enterobacteria phage T4|T4]]-induced modifications of ''E. coli'' [[RNA polymerase]] under the direction of [[Walter Gilbert]] and [[James Watson]]. He completed his PhD in 1974.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = H. Robert Horvitz - Biographical|url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2002/horvitz-bio.html|website = www.nobelprize.org|access-date = 2016-01-26}}</ref>

==Career==
In 1974, Horvitz took a postdoctoral position at the [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]] (LMB) in Cambridge, England, where he worked with his future Nobel prize co-winners [[Sydney Brenner]] and [[John Sulston]] on the genetics and cell lineage of ''C. elegans''. In 1978, Horvitz was offered a faculty position at MIT, where he is currently Professor of Biology and a member of the [[McGovern Institute for Brain Research]]. He is also an Investigator of the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]].

Horvitz serves as the chair of the board of trustees for [[Society for Science & the Public]] and is a member of the [[USA Science and Engineering Festival]]'s Advisory Board.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usasciencefestival.org/about/advisors |title=USA Science and Engineering Festival - Advisors |publisher=Usasciencefestival.org |access-date=2013-04-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421005310/http://www.usasciencefestival.org/about/advisors/ |archive-date=2010-04-21 }}</ref>

== Research ==
At LMB, Horvitz worked with Sulston to track every non-gonadal cell division that occurred during larval development, and published a complete description of these lineages in 1977.<ref name="Nobelprize"/><ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://hobertlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/Sulston_1977.pdf|title = Post-embryonic Cell Lineages of the Nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans|last1 = Sulston|first1 = J.E.|date = 1977|journal = Developmental Biology|access-date = 26 January 2016|last2 = Horvitz|first2 = H.R.|volume = 56|issue = 1|pages = 110–156|doi=10.1016/0012-1606(77)90158-0|pmid=838129}}</ref> Later, in cooperation with Sulston and Martin Chalfie, Horvitz began investigations first characterizing several cell lineage mutants<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Isolation and genetic characterization of cell-lineage mutants of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans|journal = Genetics|date = 1980-10-01|issn = 0016-6731|pmc = 1214309|pmid = 7262539|pages = 435–454|volume = 96|issue = 2|first1 = H.

Robert|last2 = Horvitz}}</ref> and then seeking genes that controlled cell lineage or that controlled specific linages. In 1981, they identified and characterized the gene ''[[Lin-4 microRNA precursor|lin-4]]'', a "[[Heterochrony|heterochronic]]" mutant that changes the timeline of cell fates.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Mutations that lead to reiterations in the cell lineages of C. elegans|journal = Cell|date = 1981-04-01|issn = 0092-8674|pmid = 7237544|pages = 59–69|volume = 24|issue = 1|first1 = M.|last1 = Chalfie|first2 = H.

In his early work at MIT, Horvitz continued his work on cell lineage and cell fate, using ''C. elegans'' to investigate whether there was a genetic program controlling cell death, or [[apoptosis]]. In 1986, he identified the first "death genes", ''ced-3'' and ''ced-4''. He showed that functional ''ced-3'' and ''ced-4'' genes were a prerequisite for cell death to be executed.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Genetic control of programmed cell death in the nematode C. elegans|journal = Cell|date = 1986-03-28|pages = 817–829|volume = 44|issue = 6|doi = 10.1016/0092-8674(86)90004-8|first1 = Hilary M.|last1 = Ellis|first2 = H. Robert|last2 = Horvitz|pmid=3955651|s2cid = 44031839}}</ref> He went on to show that another gene, ''ced-9'', protects against cell death by interacting with ''ced-4'' and ''ced-3'', as well as identifying a number of genes that direct how a dead cell is eliminated. Horvitz showed that the human genome contains a ''ced-3''-like gene.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Mechanisms and Functions of Cell Death|journal = Annual Review of Cell Biology|date = 1991-01-01|pmid = 1809356|pages = 663–698|volume = 7|issue = 1|doi = 10.1146/annurev.cb.07.110191.003311|first1 = Ronald E.|last1 = Ellis|first2 = Junying|last2 = Yuan|first3 = H.

Horvitz's later research continued to use ''C. elegans'' to analyze the genetic control of animal development and behavior, as well as to link discoveries in the nematode to human diseases, particularly cancer and neurodegenerative diseases such as [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS). He made further advancements in defining the molecular pathway of programmed cell death, and has identified several key components, including: EGL-1, a protein which activates apoptosis by inhibiting CED-9;<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The C. elegans protein EGL-1 is required for programmed cell death and interacts with the Bcl-2-like protein CED-9|journal = Cell|date = 1998-05-15|issn = 0092-8674|pmid = 9604928|pages = 519–529|volume = 93|issue = 4|first1 = B.|last1 = Conradt|first2 = H.
