==Education and early life==
George Emil Palade was born on November 19, 1912 in [[Iași]], [[Romania]]; his father was a professor of philosophy at the [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza University|University of Iași]] and his mother was a high school teacher. Palade received his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] in 1940 from the [[Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy|Carol Davila School of Medicine]] in [[Bucharest]].

==Career and research==
[[File:RO033-16.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Palade on a 2016 Romanian stamp]]
Palade was a member of the faculty at Carol Davila University until 1946, when he went to the United States<ref name="nobelprize.org"/> to do [[postdoctoral research]]. While assisting [[Robert Chambers (biologist)|Robert Chambers]] in the Biology Laboratory of [[New York University]], he met Professor [[Albert Claude]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1974/palade-autobio.html|title=George E.

Palade – Autobiography |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=2008-10-07 |access-date=2011-04-03}}</ref>

In 1952, Palade became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States. He worked at the Rockefeller Institute (1958–1973), and was a professor at [[Yale University]] Medical School (1973–1990), and [[University of California, San Diego]] (1990–2008). At UCSD, Palade was Professor of Medicine in Residence (Emeritus) in the Department of Cellular & Molecular Medicine, as well as a Dean for Scientific Affairs (Emeritus), in the School of Medicine at La Jolla, California.<ref>[http://cmm.ucsd.edu/palade/ Professor George E.

In 1970, he was awarded the [[Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize]] from [[Columbia University]] together with [[Renato Dulbecco]] winner of 1975 [[Nobel Prize]] in Physiology or Medicine "''for discoveries concerning the functional organization of the cell that were seminal events in the development of modern cell biology''",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1974/ |title=The 1974 Nobel Prize for Medicine |publisher=Nobelprize.org |access-date=2011-04-03}}</ref> related to his previous research carried out at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20040603122903/http://www.rockefeller.edu/nobel.html Nobel Laureates Affiliated with The Rockefeller University]. rockefeller.edu</ref> His Nobel lecture, delivered on December 12, 1974, was entitled:  ''"Intracellular Aspects of the Process of Protein Secretion"'',<ref name="Nobel lecture">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1974/palade-lecture.html |title=Nobel lecture |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=1974-12-12 |access-date=2011-04-03}}</ref> published in 1992 by the Nobel Prize Foundation,<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1974/palade-lecture.pdf The Nobel Prize Lecture of George E.

He received the Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]] in 1975.<ref>{{cite web|title= Golden Plate Awardees of the American Academy of Achievement |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://achievement.org/our-history/golden-plate-awards/#science-exploration}}</ref> In 1981, Palade became a founding member of the [[World Cultural Council]].<ref>{{cite web | title = About Us | publisher = [[World Cultural Council]] | url = http://www.consejoculturalmundial.org/about-us/ | access-date = November 8, 2016}}</ref> 
In 1985, he became the founding editor of the ''[[Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology]]''.<ref name="Spudich">{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev.cb.10.111406.100001|title=Preface|year=1994|last1=Spudich|first1=James A.|journal=Annual Review of Cell Biology|volume=10}}</ref>
In 1988 he was also elected an Honorary Member of the [[American-Romanian Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (ARA).

Palade was the first Chairman of the Department of Cell Biology at Yale University. Presently, the Chair of Cell Biology at Yale is named the "George Palade Professorship".

At the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research, Palade used [[electron microscope|electron microscopy]] to study the internal organization of such cell structures as [[ribosome]]s, [[mitochondria]], [[chloroplast]]s, the Golgi apparatus, and others. His most important discovery was made while using an experimental strategy known as a [[pulse-chase analysis]]. In the experiment Palade and his colleagues were able to confirm an existing hypothesis that a secretory pathway exists and that the [[Rough ER]] and the [[Golgi apparatus]] function together.

He focused on [[Weibel-Palade bodies]] (a storage organelle unique to the [[endothelium]], containing [[von Willebrand factor]] and various proteins) which he described together with the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] anatomist [[Ewald R. Weibel]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Weibel | first1 = ER | last2 = Palade | first2 = GE | year = 1964 | title = New cytoplasmic components in arterial endothelia | journal =  The Journal of Cell Biology| volume = 23 | pages = 101–112 | doi=10.1083/jcb.23.1.101 | pmid=14228505 | pmc=2106503}}</ref>

===Palade's coworkers and approach in the 1960s===
The following is a concise excerpt from Palade's Autobiography appearing in the Nobel Award documents<ref name="nobelprize.org"/>

{{quote|In the 1960s, I continued the work on the secretory process using in parallel or in succession two different approaches. The first relied exclusively on cell fractionation, and was developed in collaboration with [[Philip Siekevitz]], [[Lewis Joel Greene]], [[Colvin Redman]], [[David D. Sabatini|David Sabatini]] and [[Yutaka Tashiro]]; it led to the characterization of the zymogen granules and to the discovery of the segregation of secretory products in the cisternal space of the endoplasmic reticulum. The second approach relied primarily on radioautography, and involved experiments on intact animals or pancreatic slices which were carried out in collaboration with Lucien Caro and especially James Jamieson. This series of investigations produced a good part of our current ideas on the synthesis and intracellular processing of proteins for export. A critical review of this line of research is presented in the Nobel Lecture.<ref name="Nobel lecture"/>}}

One notes also that the [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Chemistry]] was awarded in 2009 to Drs. [[Venkatraman Ramakrishnan]], [[Thomas A. Steitz]] and [[Ada E. Yonath]] "''for studies of the structure and function of the ribosome''", discovered by Dr. George Emil Palade.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2009/ 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry], Nobel Foundation</ref>

==Personal life==
Palade's widow [[Marilyn Farquhar]] was a cell biologist at the [[University of California, San Diego]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1172/JCI37749|pmid= 19065752|pmc= 2575727|title= Obituary: "A tribute to George E.
