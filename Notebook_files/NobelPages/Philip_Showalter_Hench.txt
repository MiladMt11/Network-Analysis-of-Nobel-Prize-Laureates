'''Philip Showalter Hench''' (February 28, 1896 – March 30, 1965<ref>{{Nobelprize|access-date=2020-05-02|name=Philip S. Hench}}</ref>) was an [[United States|American]] [[physician]].  Hench, along with his [[Mayo Clinic]] co-worker [[Edward Calvin Kendall]] and [[Swiss people|Swiss]] chemist [[Tadeus Reichstein]] was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] in 1950 for the discovery of the hormone [[cortisone]], and its application for the treatment of [[rheumatoid arthritis]].  The Nobel Committee bestowed the award for the trio's "discoveries relating to the hormones of the [[adrenal cortex]], their structure and biological effects."<ref name=nobelsummary>{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1950|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1950/|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|access-date=2011-07-04}}</ref>

Hench received his undergraduate education at [[Lafayette College]] in Easton, [[Pennsylvania]], and received his medical training at the [[United States Army Medical Corps]] and the [[University of Pittsburgh]].  He began working at [[Mayo Clinic]] in 1923, later serving as the head of the Department of Rheumatology.  In addition to the Nobel Prize, Hench received many other awards and honors throughout his career.  He also had a lifelong interest in the history and discovery of [[yellow fever]].

==Early life==
He attended [[Lafayette College]] in Easton, Pennsylvania, where he obtained his Bachelor of Arts in 1916. After serving in the Medical Corps of the U.S. Army and the reserve corps to finish his medical training, he was awarded a doctorate in medicine from the [[University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine|University of Pittsburgh]] in 1920. Immediately after finishing his medical degree, Hench spent a year as an intern at St. Francis Hospital in Pittsburgh, and then he subsequently became a Fellow of the [[Mayo Foundation]].<ref name=nobelbio/>

In 1928 and 1929, Hench furthered his education at [[Freiburg University]] and the von Müller Clinic in Munich.<ref name=nobelbio/>

==Medical career==
Hench started his career at [[Mayo Clinic]] in 1923, working in the Department of Rheumatic Diseases. In 1926, he became the head of the department.  While at Mayo Clinic, Hench focused his work on arthritic diseases, where his observations led him to hypothesize that steroids alleviated pain associated with the disease.<ref name=nobelbio>{{cite web|title=Philip S. Hench|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1950/hench.html|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|access-date=2011-07-04}}</ref>  During this same time, biochemist [[Edward Calvin Kendall]] has isolated several steroids from the [[adrenal gland]] cortex.  After several years of work, the duo decided to try one of these steroids (dubbed Compound E at the time, later to become known as [[cortisone]]) on patients afflicted by [[rheumatoid arthritis]].<ref name=nobelbio />  Testing of the hypothesis was delayed because the synthesis of Compound E was costly and time-consuming, and Hench served in the military during [[World War II]]. The tests were conducted successfully in 1948 and 1949.<ref name=nobelbio />

[[File:MedicineNobelBack.jpg|thumb|left|Hench's Nobel Prize]]
Hench, Kendall, and Swiss chemist [[Tadeus Reichstein]] were awarded the 1950 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] "for their discoveries relating to the hormones of the adrenal cortex, their structure and biological effects."<ref name=nobelsummary />  As of the 2010 prizes, Hench and Kendall are the only two Nobel laureates affiliated with Mayo Clinic.<ref name=nobelaffils>{{cite web|title=Nobel Laureates and Research Affiliations|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/universities.html|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|access-date=2011-07-04}}</ref>  Hench's Nobel Lecture was directly related to the research he was honored for, and titled "The Reversibility of Certain Rheumatic and Non-Rheumatic  Conditions by the Use of Cortisone Or of the Pituitary  Adrenocorticotropic Hormone".<ref name=nobellecture>{{cite web|title=Philip S. Hench|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1950/hench-lecture.html|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|access-date=2011-07-04}}</ref>  His speech at the banquet during the award ceremony acknowledged the connections between the study of medicine and chemistry, saying of his co-winners "Perhaps the ratio of one physician to two chemists is symbolic, since medicine is so firmly linked to chemistry by a double bond."<ref name=speech>{{cite web|title=Philip S. Hench - Banquet Speech|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1950/hench-speech.html|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|access-date=2011-07-04}}</ref>

During his career, Hench was one of the founding members of the American Rheumatism Association, and served as its president in 1940 and 1941.<ref name=memoriam />  In addition to the Nobel Prize, Hench has been awarded the Heberdeen Medal (1942), the [[Lasker Award]] (1949), the [[Passano Foundation]] Award (1950), and the [[Criss Award]].<ref name=nobelbio />  Lafayette College, [[Washington and Jefferson College]], [[Western Reserve University]], the [[National University of Ireland]] and the University of Pittsburgh awarded Hench honorary doctorates.<ref name=nobelbio />

In addition to his work with cortisone, Hench had a career long interest in [[yellow fever]].  Starting in 1937, Hench began to document the history behind the discovery of yellow fever.  His collection of documents on this subject are at the [[University of Virginia]] in the Philip S. Hench Walter Reed Yellow Fever Collection.<ref name=yellowfever>{{cite web|title=The Story|url=http://yellowfever.lib.virginia.edu/reed/story.html|publisher=University of Virginia|access-date=2011-07-04}}</ref>  His wife donated the collection to the university after his death.<ref name=yfhench>{{cite web|title=Philip S.

==Family==
Hench married Mary Kahler (1905-1982) in 1927.<ref name=nobelbio />  His father-in-law, John Henry Kahler, was a friend of Mayo Clinic founder [[William J. Mayo]].<ref name=kahler>{{cite web|title=About Kahler|url=http://www.kahlerinnsuites.com/about_kahler/|publisher=Kahler Hotels|access-date=2011-07-04|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624104413/http://www.kahlerinnsuites.com/about_kahler/|archive-date=2011-06-24}}</ref>  Hench and his wife had four children, two daughters and two sons.<ref name=nobelbio />  His son, Philip Kahler Hench also studied rheumatology.<ref name=obit>{{cite journal|title=Philip S.
