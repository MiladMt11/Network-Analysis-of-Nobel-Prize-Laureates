He received his education as a psychologist at the [[Department of Psychology, University of Oslo]] and obtained a PhD in [[neurophysiology]] at the [[University of Oslo Faculty of Medicine|Faculty of Medicine]] at the same university in 1995; in 1996 he was appointed as associate professor in [[biological psychology]] at the Department of Psychology at the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] (NTNU); he was promoted to professor of neuroscience in 1998. In 2002, his research group was given the status of a separate "centre of excellence". Edvard Moser has led a succession of research groups and centres, collectively known as the [[Moser research environment]].

==Background and early life==
Moser was born in [[Ålesund]] to German parents Eduard Paul Moser (1928–2013) and Ingeborg Annamarie Herholz (1931–). His parents had grown up in [[Kronberg im Taunus]], a suburb of [[Frankfurt]], where Moser's grandfather Eduard Moser had been Lutheran parish priest. Moser's father trained as a [[pipe organ]] builder and emigrated to Norway together with his friend Jakob Pieroth in 1953 when they were offered employment at a pipe organ workshop at [[Haramsøy]]. They later established their own workshop and built many church pipe organs in Norway.<ref>"Orgelskatt på fabrikkloft," ''Sunnmørsposten'' 21 February 1994 p. 7</ref><ref>"[https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wissen/zu-besuch-bei-nobelpreistraegerin-may-britt-moser-13193347.html Ratten mit Hütchen]", ''FAZ'', 7 October 2014</ref> The Moser family originally was from [[Nassau, Rhineland-Palatinate|Nassau]]; Moser is a South German topographic name for someone who lived near a [[swamp]] or [[mire]] (South German ''Moos'').<ref>Jana Kötter, "Ein Hoch auf die Heimat", ''Taunus-Zeitung'', 16 October 2014</ref> Edvard Moser grew up at [[Hareid]] and in [[Ålesund]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smp.no/nyheter/article10203143.ece|title=Nobelprisen neste?|author=Inger Otterlei|date=9 April 2011|work=smp.no}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2014/10/06/nyheter/forskning/nobelpris/nobelpris_i_medisin/may-britt_moser/35616764/|title=Flagget for May-Britt og Edvard|author=Fridgeir Walderhaug|date=6 October 2014|work=Dagbladet.no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wissen/zu-besuch-bei-nobelpreistraegerin-may-britt-moser-13193347.html|title=Zu Besuch bei Nobelpreisträgerin May-Britt Moser|author=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung GmbH|date=7 October 2014|newspaper=FAZ.NET}}</ref> He was raised in a conservative [[Christians|Christian]] family.<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2014/edvard-moser-bio.html Edvard Moser – Biographical]</ref>

==Career==
Edvard Moser was awarded the ''cand.psychol.'' degree in psychology at the [[Department of Psychology, University of Oslo|Department of Psychology]] at the [[University of Oslo]] in 1990. He was then employed as a research fellow at the Faculty of Medicine, where he obtained his ''dr.philos.'' doctoral research degree in the field of [[neurophysiology]] in 1995.<ref>Moser, M-B. (1995). ''Field potential changes in the dentate gyrus during spatial learning in the rat''.

Moser went on to undertake postdoctoral training with [[Richard G.

Moser returned to Norway in 1996 to be appointed associate professor in biological psychology at the Department of Psychology at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) in Trondheim. He was promoted to full professor of neuroscience in 1998. Moser is also head of department of the NTNU Institute for Systems Neuroscience.
