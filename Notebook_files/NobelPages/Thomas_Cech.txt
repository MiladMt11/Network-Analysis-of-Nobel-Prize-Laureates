'''Thomas Robert Cech''' (born December 8, 1947) is an American chemist who shared the 1989 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] with [[Sidney Altman]], for their discovery of the catalytic properties of RNA. Cech discovered that RNA could itself cut strands of RNA, suggesting that life might have started as RNA.<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1989/illpres/ The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1989:] Illustrated Presentation</ref> He also studied [[telomeres]], and his lab discovered an enzyme, TERT (telomerase reverse transcriptase), which is part of the process of restoring telomeres after they are shortened during cell division.<ref>[http://www.hhmi.org/research/investigators/cech.html Telomeres, Telomerase, and Other Noncoding RNAs], Howard Hughes Medical Institute, July 13, 2010</ref> As president of [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]], he promoted science education, and he teaches an undergraduate chemistry course at the [[University of Colorado]].

==Early life and career==
Cech was born to parents of [[Czechs|Czech]] origin (his grandfather was Czech, his other grandparents were first-generation Americans) in Chicago, he grew up in [[Iowa City, Iowa]]. In junior high school, he knocked on the doors of geology professors at the University of Iowa, and asked them to discuss crystal structures, meteorites and fossils.<ref name="nobel-autobiography">[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1989/cech-autobio.html Nobel autobiography]. Nobelprize.org. Retrieved on 2013-10-22.</ref>  

A [[National Merit Scholarship Program|National Merit Scholar]], Cech entered [[Grinnell College]] in 1966. There he studied Homer's [[Odyssey]], Dante's [[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]], constitutional history and chemistry. He married his organic chemistry lab partner, Carol Lynn Martinson, and graduated with a B.A. in 1970.<ref name="nobel-autobiography"/>

In 1975, Cech completed his PhD in Chemistry at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and in the same year, he entered the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] where he engaged in postdoctoral research. In 1978, he obtained his first faculty position at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] where he lectured undergraduate students in chemistry and [[biochemistry]], and where he remains on the faculty, currently as Distinguished Professor in the Department of Biochemistry. In 2000, Cech succeeded [[Purnell Choppin]] as president of the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] in [[Maryland]]. He also continued to head his biochemistry laboratory at the University of Colorado, Boulder. On April 1, 2008, Cech announced that he would step down as the president of [[HHMI]], to return to teaching and research, in spring 2009.<ref>[http://www.hhmi.org/news/cech20080401.html HHMI News: Thomas R. Cech to Step Down as HHMI President]. Hhmi.org (2008-04-01). Retrieved on 2013-10-22.</ref> Returning to Boulder, Cech became the first Executive Director of the BioFrontiers Institute, a position he held until 2020. He also taught General Chemistry to freshmen.

==Research==
Cech's main research area is that of the process of [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] in the nucleus of cells. He studies how the [[genetic code]] of [[DNA]] is transcribed into [[RNA]]. In the 1970s, Cech had been studying the [[RNA splicing|splicing]] of RNA in the unicellular organism ''[[Tetrahymena thermophila]]'' when he discovered that an unprocessed RNA molecule could splice itself. In 1982, Cech became the first to show that RNA molecules are not restricted to being passive carriers of genetic information – they can have [[catalytic]] functions and can participate in cellular reactions. RNA-processing reactions and protein synthesis on [[ribosome]]s in particular are catalysed by RNA. RNA [[enzyme]]s are known as [[ribozymes]] and have provided a new tool for gene technology. They also have the potential to provide new therapeutic agents – for example, they have the ability to destroy and cleave invading, [[Virus rna|viral RNAs]].

Cech's second area of research is on [[telomeres]], the structure that protects the ends of [[chromosomes]]. Telomeres are shortened with every duplication of DNA, and must be lengthened again. He studies [[telomerase]], the enzyme that copies the telomeric sequences and lengthens them. The active site protein subunits of telomerase comprise a new class of [[reverse transcriptase]]s, enzymes previously thought to be restricted to viruses and [[transposable elements]]. [[Telomerase]] is activated in 90% of human cancers. Therefore, a drug that would inhibit its activity could be useful in treating [[cancer]].

==Awards==
Cech's work has been recognised by many awards and prizes including: lifetime Professorship by the [[American Cancer Society]] (1987), the [[Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize]] from [[Columbia University]] (1988), the [[Dr A.H. Heineken Prize|Heineken Prize]] of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Sciences (1988), the [[Lasker Award|Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award]] (1988), the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] (1989, shared with [[Sidney Altman]]), the Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]] in 1990<ref>{{cite web|title= Golden Plate Awardees of the American Academy of Achievement |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://achievement.org/our-history/golden-plate-awards/#science-exploration}}</ref> and the [[National Medal of Science]] (1995).<ref>[https://www.nsf.gov/od/nms/recip_details.cfm?recip_id=71 National Science Foundation – The President's National Medal of Science].
