'''Antony Hewish''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRS|FInstP}}<ref name=frs/> (11 May 1924 – 13 September 2021) was a British [[radio astronomy|radio astronomer]] who won the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1974 (together with fellow radio-astronomer [[Martin Ryle]])<ref>{{Cite book|title=The road to Stockholm : Nobel Prizes, science, and scientists|last=István.|first=Hargittai|date=2007|orig-year=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0198607854|location=Oxford|oclc=818659203}}</ref> for his role in the discovery of [[pulsar]]s.

==Early life and education==
Hewish attended [[King's College, Taunton]].<ref name=guardian/> His undergraduate degree at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]], was interrupted by war service at the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]], and at the [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]] where he worked with [[Martin Ryle]].<ref name=death/> Returning to [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] in 1946, Hewish completed his degree and immediately joined [[Cavendish Astrophysics Group|Ryle's research team]] at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]].<ref name=guardian/> For his [[PhD thesis]], awarded in 1952, Hewish made both practical and theoretical advances in the observation and exploitation of the apparent [[Interplanetary scintillation|scintillation]]s of radio sources due to their radiation impinging upon [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]].<ref name=phd>{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Antony|last=Hewish |title=The Fluctuations of Galactic Radio Waves |publisher=University of Cambridge |date=1952 |url=http://ulmss-newton.lib.cam.ac.uk/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=35256}}</ref>

==Career and research==
Hewish proposed the construction of a large [[phased array]] radio telescope, which could be used to perform a [[astronomical survey|survey]] at high [[time-domain astronomy|time resolution]], primarily for studying [[interplanetary scintillation]].<ref name=guardian/> In 1965 he secured funding to construct his design, the [[Interplanetary Scintillation Array]], at the [[Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory|Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory (MRAO)]] outside [[Cambridge]].<ref name=guardian/> It was completed in 1967. One of Hewish's [[PhD]] students, [[Jocelyn Bell Burnell|Jocelyn Bell]] (later known as Jocelyn Bell Burnell), helped to build the array and was assigned to analyse its output.<ref name=guardian/> Bell soon discovered a radio source which was ultimately recognised as the first [[pulsar]]. The [[scientific paper]] announcing the discovery<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://www.nature.com/physics/looking-back/hewish/index.html |title=Observation of a Rapidly Pulsating Radio Source |first1=A. |last1=Hewish |first2=S.

Hewish and Ryle were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1974 for work on the development of radio aperture synthesis and for Hewish's decisive role in the discovery of pulsars. The exclusion of Bell from the Nobel prize was controversial (see [[Nobel Prize controversies#1974 2|Nobel prize controversies]]). Fellow Cambridge astronomer [[Fred Hoyle]] argued that Bell should have received a share of the prize.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b016812j |title=The Life Scientific, Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell |publisher=[[BBC Radio 4]] |date=25 October 2011 |access-date=16 December 2015}}</ref> Bell disagreed, stating "it would demean Nobel Prizes if they were awarded to research students, except in very exceptional cases, and I do not believe this is one of them".<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.bigear.org/CSMO/HTML/CS01/cs01p16.htm |journal=Cosmic Search |title=Little Green Men, White Dwarfs or Pulsars? |first=S.

Hewish was professor of radio astronomy in the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] from 1971 to 1989 and head of the [[Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory|MRAO]] from 1982 to 1988.<ref name=death/> He developed an association with the [[Royal Institution]] in London when it was directed by Sir [[Lawrence Bragg]]. In 1965 he was invited to co-deliver the [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Royal Institution Christmas Lecture]] on "Exploration of the Universe". He subsequently gave several Friday Evening Discourses<ref name="NobelA">{{cite web |url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1974/hewish-bio.html |title=Antony Hewish – Biographical |work=nobelprize.org |year=2015 |access-date=16 December 2015}}</ref> and was made a Professor of the Royal Institution in 1977.<ref name="WW">{{Who's Who |surname =HEWISH |othernames=Prof. Antony |id=U19992 |volume=2015 |edition= online [[Oxford University Press]]}} {{subscription required}}</ref><ref>but according to a search of the [[Royal Institution]] website he was Professor of Astronomy during 1976–1981</ref> Hewish was a [[fellow]] of [[Churchill College, Cambridge]].

===Awards and honours===
Hewish had honorary degrees from six universities, including Manchester, Exeter and Cambridge, was a foreign member of the [[The Royal Academies for Science and the Arts of Belgium|Belgian Royal Academy]], [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and the [[Indian National Science Academy]]. The [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] holds multiple portraits of him in its permanent collection.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Antony Hewish - Person - National Portrait Gallery|url=https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp06515|url-status=live|access-date=17 September 2021|website=National Portrait Gallery, London}}</ref> Other awards and honours include:<ref name="WW"/>

==Personal life==
Hewish married Marjorie Elizabeth Catherine Richards in 1950. They had a son, a physicist, and a daughter, a language teacher.<ref name="NobelA"/><ref>{{cite web|year=|title=The Papers of Professor Antony Hewish|url=https://archivesearch.lib.cam.ac.uk/repositories/9/resources/1643|url-status=live|access-date=11 October 2021|work=Churchill Archives Centre}}</ref> Hewish died on 13 September 2021, aged 97.<ref name=death>{{cite news |title=Professor Antony Hewish (1924 – 2021) |url=https://www.cai.cam.ac.uk/news/professor-antony-hewish-1924-%E2%80%93-2021 |access-date=16 September 2021 |publisher=[[Gonville & Caius College]] |date=16 September 2021 |language=en}}</ref>

===Religious views===
Hewish argued that religion and science are complementary. In the foreword to ''[[Questions of Truth]]'', Hewish writes, "The ghostly presence of [[virtual particle]]s defies rational common sense and is non-intuitive for those unacquainted with physics. Religious belief in God, and Christian belief ... may seem strange to common-sense thinking. But when the most elementary physical things behave in this way, we should be prepared to accept that the deepest aspects of our existence go beyond our common-sense understanding."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Polkinghorne |first1=John |author-link=John Polkinghorne | last2=Beale |first2=Nicholas |title=Questions of Truth: Fifty-one Responses to Questions about God, Science, and Belief |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jiXANZ1CPD4C |date=19 January 2009 |publisher=[[Westminster John Knox Press]] |page=12 |isbn=978-1-61164-003-8 |access-date=27 July 2012}}</ref>
