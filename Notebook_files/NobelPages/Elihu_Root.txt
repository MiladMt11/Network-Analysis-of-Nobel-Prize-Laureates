'''Elihu Root''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|l|ᵻ|h|juː|_|ˈ|r|uː|t}}; February 15, 1845{{spaced ndash}}February 7, 1937) was an American [[lawyer]] and statesman who served as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] under President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and as [[Secretary of War]] under Roosevelt and President [[William McKinley]]. He moved frequently between high-level appointed government positions in [[Washington, D.C.]] and [[private-sector]] legal practice in [[New York City]]. For that reason, he is sometimes considered to be the prototype of the 20th century political "[[The Wise Men (book)|wise man]]," advising presidents on a range of foreign and domestic issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ushistoryscene.com/article/elihu-root/|title='No anecdotes are told of Elihu Root': America's Twentieth Century Wise Man|last=Akiboh|first=Alvita|work=U.S. History Scene|access-date=5 April 2020}}</ref> He was elected by the state legislature as a U.S. Senator from New York and served one term, 1909–1915. Root was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1912.

Root was a leading lawyer, whose clients included major corporations and such powerful players as [[Andrew Carnegie]]. Root served as president or chairman of the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]], the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and the Carnegie Corporation of New York. As Secretary of War under McKinley and Roosevelt, Root designed American policies for the new colonial possessions, especially the [[Philippines]] and [[Cuba]]. His role in suppressing a Filipino revolt angered anti-imperialist activists at home. Root favored a paternalistic approach to colonial administration, emphasizing technology, engineering, and disinterested public service, as exemplified by the ethical standards of the [[Progressive Era]]. He helped design the [[Foraker Act]] of 1900, the [[Philippine Organic Act (1902)]], and the [[Platt Amendment]] of 1901, which authorized American intervention in Cuba in the future if needed to maintain a stable government. He was a strong advocate of what became the [[Panama Canal]], and he championed the [[Open Door Policy|Open Door]] to expand world trade with China.<ref>Robert Muccigrosso, ed., ''Research Guide to American Historical Biography'' (1988) 3:1329–33</ref> Root was a prominent opponent of [[women's suffrage]] and worked to ensure the New York state constitution allowed only men to vote.

Root was the leading modernizer in the history of the War Department, transforming the [[History of the United States Army|Army]] from a motley collection of small frontier outposts and coastal defense units into a modern, professionally organized, military machine comparable to the best in Europe. He restructured the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] into an effective reserve, created the Army War College for the advanced study of military doctrine, and—most important—set up a general staff. As Secretary of State under Theodore Roosevelt, Root modernized the consular service by minimizing patronage, promoted friendly relations with Latin America, and resolved frictions with Japan over the immigration of unskilled workers to the West Coast. He negotiated 24 bilateral treaties that committed the United States and other signatories to use arbitration to resolve disputes, which led to the creation of the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Cross |first=Graham |date=2012 |title=The Diplomatic Education of Franklin D.

He played a central role at the Republican National Convention in 1912 in getting Taft renominated. By 1916–17, he was a leading proponent of preparedness, with the expectation that the United States would enter [[World War I]]. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] sent him to Russia in 1917 in an unsuccessful effort to establish an alliance with the new revolutionary government that had replaced the czar.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tells How Allies Failed in Russia: Col.

==Early life and education==
Elihu Root was born in [[Clinton, Oneida County, New York|Clinton, New York]], to Oren Root and Nancy Whitney Buttrick, both of [[English American|English]] descent.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography: Being the History of the United States as Illustrated in the Lives of the Founders, Builders, and Defenders of the Republic, and of the Men and Women who are Doing the Work and Moulding the Thought of the Present Time'', Volume 11 page 15</ref> His father was professor of mathematics at [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]]. After studying at local schools, including [[Williston Seminary]], where he was a classmate of [[G. Stanley Hall]], Elihu enrolled in college at Hamilton. He joined the [[Sigma Phi|Sigma Phi Society]] and was elected to the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]]<ref>[http://pbk.rutgers.edu/history.shtml History of the Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709093431/http://pbk.rutgers.edu/history.shtml |date=2009-07-09 }}, Rutgers.edu, accessed Oct 9, 2009,</ref> After graduation, Root was an instructor of physical education for two years at Williston Seminary and taught for one year at the [[Rome, New York|Rome]] (N.Y.) Free Academy.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Despite his parents' encouragement to become a [[Presbyterian minister]], Root went to New York City to attend [[NYU Law|New York University School of Law]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heritage.org/political-process/report/constitutional-conservatives-the-progressive-era-elihu-root-william-howard|title=Constitutional Conservatives in the Progressive Era: Elihu Root, William Howard Taft, and Henry Cabot Lodge, Sr.|first=Johnathan|last=O'Neill|date=February 15, 2013|website=The Heritage Foundation}}</ref> from which he graduated in 1867. His brother [[Oren Root II|Oren Root Jr.]] then became a minister and followed in their father's footsteps as a Mathematics professor at Hamilton.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://threerivershms.com/rcautica.htm|title=History of Montgomery Classis, R.C.A.|website=threerivershms.com}}</ref>

==Law career==
After [[Admission to the bar in the United States|admission to the bar]] in New York, Root went into private practice as a lawyer. While mainly focusing on corporate law, Root was a junior defense counsel for [[William M. Tweed|William "Boss" Tweed]] during his corruption trial. Among Root's prominent and wealthy private clients were [[Jay Gould]], [[Chester A. Arthur]], [[Charles Anderson Dana]], [[William C. Whitney]], [[Thomas Fortune Ryan]], and [[E. H. Harriman]]. Root was among the friends who were present when Arthur was informed that [[James A. Garfield]] had died, and that Arthur had succeeded to the [[President of the United States|presidency]].<ref>{{cite magazine |date=January 1, 1930 |title=Chester A.

Root's law practice, which he began in 1868, evolved into the law firm [[Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam & Roberts]], a predecessor of today's [[Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman]].<ref name=PWSP>{{cite web|title=Pillsbury.

===Defense of William M. Tweed===
Root was part of the defense counsel that [[William M. Tweed|William M. “Boss” Tweed]] created to defend himself during Tweed's first court case in January 1873. Other members of the defense counsel included John Graham and [[David Dudley Field II]]. This first trial ended when the jury could not agree on a verdict. A second trial began November 1873 and this time Tweed received a sentence of twelve years in prison and a $12,750 fine from judge [[Noah Davis]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Oliver E.|title=The Tiger: The Rise and Fall of Tammany Hall|date=1993|publisher=Addison-Wesley Publishing Company|pages=[https://archive.org/details/tigerrisefalloft00alle/page/138 138–139]|isbn=0-201-62463-X|url=https://archive.org/details/tigerrisefalloft00alle/page/138|url-access=registration}}</ref>

===Opposition to women's rights===

Root was a prominent opponent of [[women's suffrage]]. As chairman of the judiciary committee of a New York State constitutional convention in 1894, Root spoke against women's right to vote, and he worked to ensure that the right was not included in the state constitution. He would remain an active opponent of [[feminism]] for the rest of his career, becoming the president of an anti-suffrage league in 1917.<ref name=Marshall1997>{{cite book |last=Marshall |first=Susan E. |title=Splintered Sisterhood |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h3itDekmfAIC&pg=PA66 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |pages=66, 79 |date=1997 |isbn=9780299154639 }}</ref>

On January 19, 1898, at elections for the newly formed [[North American Trust Company]], the elected members of the executive committee included Root.<ref name=nyt-trenholm>{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=A Place for Colonel Trenholm; Head of North American Trust Company -- W.S.

==U.S Attorney and Secretary of War==
[[File:Elihuroot 1904 rnc (cropped).jpg|thumb|Crowds listen as Root delivers the opening speech of the [[1904 Republican National Convention]]]] 
Root received his first political appointment from President [[Chester A. Arthur]], when he was named as the [[U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York]].

Under presidents [[William McKinley]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]], Root served as the [[United States Secretary of War]] 1899–1904. He reformed the organization of the [[United States Department of War|War Department]]. He enlarged [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] and established the [[U.S. Army War College]], as well as the [[Staff (military)|General Staff]]. He changed the procedures for promotions and organized schools for the special branches of the service. He also devised the principle of rotating officers from staff to line. Root was concerned about the new territories acquired after the [[Spanish–American War]]. He worked out the procedures for turning Cuba over to the Cubans, ensured a charter of government for the Philippines, and eliminated tariffs on goods imported to the United States from Puerto Rico. When the [[American Anti-Imperialist League|Anti-Imperialist League]] attacked American policies in the Philippines, Root defended the policies and counterattacked the critics, saying they prolonged the insurgency.<ref>{{cite book|author=James R.

==Secretary of State==
{{norefs|section|date = May 2021}}
[[File:Taft-Root.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Root with [[William Howard Taft]] in 1904]]

In 1905, President Roosevelt named Root as the [[United States Secretary of State]] after the death of [[John Hay]]. As secretary, Root placed the consular service under the [[United States civil service|civil service]]. He maintained the [[Open Door Policy]] in the Far East.

On a tour of Latin America in 1906, Root persuaded those governments to participate in the [[Hague_Conventions_of_1899_and_1907#Hague_Convention_of_1907|Hague Peace Conference]]. He worked with Japan to limit emigration to the United States and on dealings with China. He established the [[Root–Takahira Agreement]], which limited Japanese and American naval fortifications in the Pacific. He worked with [[Great Britain]] in arbitration of issues between the United States and Canada on the [[Alaska boundary dispute]], and competition in the North Atlantic fisheries. He supported arbitration in resolving international disputes.

==United States Senator==
In [[United States Senate election in New York, 1909|January 1909]], Root was elected by the legislature as a [[U.S. Senator from New York]], serving from March 4, 1909, to March 3, 1915. He was a member of the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Committee on the Judiciary]]. He chose not to seek re-election in [[New York state election, 1914|1914]].

During and after his Senate service, Root served as president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, from 1910 to 1925.

In a 1910 letter published by ''[[The New York Times]]'', Root supported the proposed [[income tax]] amendment, which was ratified as the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]:

<blockquote>
It is said that a very large part of any income tax under the amendment would be paid by citizens of New York...

The reason why the citizens of New York will pay so large a part of the tax in New York City is the chief financial and commercial center of a great country with vast resources and industrial activity. For many years Americans engaged in developing the wealth of all parts of the country have been going to New York to secure capital and market their securities and to buy their supplies. Thousands of men who have amassed fortunes in all sorts of enterprises in other states have gone to New York to live because they like the life of the city or because their distant enterprises require representation at the financial center. The incomes of New York are in a great measure derived from the country at large. A continual stream of wealth sets toward the great city from the mines and manufactories and railroads outside of New York.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1910/03/01/archives/root-for-adoption-of-tax-amendment-no-danger-to-state-bonds-in.html|title=ROOT FOR ADOPTION OF TAX AMENDMENT; No Danger to State Bonds in Income Provision, He Argues, Answering Hughes.

</blockquote>

Professor [[Alfred W. McCoy|Alfred McCoy]] argues that Root was the first "foreign policy grandmaster" in American history and that Root more than any other figure is responsible for transforming America into a world power. According to McCoy, Root devoted his time as Secretary of State and as a Senator to ensuring that the United States would have a consistent presence in world affairs, and Root helped to establish the [[Special Relationship]] between the United States and Great Britain. Root helped to ensure that powerful business interests and the intellectual elite supported an [[interventionism (politics)|interventionist foreign policy]].<ref name=mccoy>{{cite magazine|last1=McCoy|first1=Alfred|title=Barack Obama Is a Foreign Policy Grandmaster|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/barack-obama-is-a-foreign-policy-grandmaster/|access-date=14 November 2015|magazine=The Nation|date=15 September 2015}}</ref>

==World War==
{{see also|American entry into World War I}}
[[File:ERoot-portrait.jpg|thumb|Portrait of Elihu Root]]
In 1912, as a result of his work to bring nations together through arbitration and cooperation, Root received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].

At the outbreak of [[World War I]], Root opposed President [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s policy of neutrality. Root promoted the [[Preparedness Movement]] to get the United States ready for actual participation in the war. He was a leading advocate of American entry into the war on the side of the British and French because he feared the [[militarism of Germany]] would be bad for the world and bad for the United States.

He supported Wilson once the United States entered the war. In June 1916, he scotched talk that he might contend for the [[1916 Republican National Convention|Republican presidential nomination]], stating that he was too old to bear the burden of the Presidency.<ref>[[Stefan Lorant]], ''The Glorious Burden'' (New York: Harper & Row, 1968), page 540.</ref> At the [[Republican National Convention]], Root reached his peak strength of 103 votes on the first ballot. The Republican presidential nomination went to [[Charles Evans Hughes]], who lost [[1916 United States presidential election|the election]] to the Democrat [[Woodrow Wilson]].

In June 1917, at age 72, Root went to [[Russia]], which had just overthrown the czar. He headed a mission sent by President Wilson, the [[Root Commission]], to arrange American co-operation with the new revolutionary government. Root remained in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] for close to a month, and was not much impressed by what he saw. American financial aid to the new regime was possible only if the Russians would fight on the Allied side. The Russians, he said, "are sincere, kindly, good people but confused and dazed". He summed up the Provisional Government very trenchantly: "No fight, no loans."<ref>{{cite book|author=David Mayers|title=The Ambassadors and America's Soviet Policy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IjyhTRwvyIMC&pg=PA77|year=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=77|isbn=9780195115765}}</ref> This caused the Provisional government to initiate offensives against Austrian forces in July 1917 that ended in failure and retreat of Russian forces. The resulting steep decline in popularity of the Provisional government opened the door for the Bolshevik party.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/07/opinion/us-aid-to-the-bolsheviks.html|title=Opinion &#124; U.S. 'AID' TO THE BOLSHEVIKS|first=Ralph|last=Buultjens|date=November 7, 1984|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>

Root was the founding chairman of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], established in 1918 in New York.

==Later career==
In the Senate fight in 1919 over American membership in the [[League of Nations]], Root supported Lodge's proposal of membership with certain reservations that allowed the United States government to decide whether or not it would go to war. The US never joined, but Root supported the League of Nations and served on the commission of jurists, which created the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]]. In 1922, when Root was 77, President [[Warren G. Harding]] appointed him as a delegate of an American team headed by Secretary of State [[Charles Evans Hughes]]. They participated in the [[Washington Naval Conference]] (International Conference on the Limitation of Armaments).<ref>[http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h1354.html u-s-history.com Washington Naval Conference] – Retrieved 2011-12-18</ref>

[[File:Levi P. Morton House.JPG|thumb|left|Root's former home in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
Root also worked with [[Andrew Carnegie]] in programs for international peace and the advancement of science, becoming the first president of the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]].{{citation needed|date = May 2021}} Root was also among the founders of the [[American Law Institute]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ali.org/about-ali/governance/|title=Governance - The American Law Institute|first=The American Law|last=Institute|website=American Law Institute}}</ref> in 1923, and also helped create [[The Hague Academy of International Law]] in the [[Netherlands]]. Root served as vice president of the [[American Peace Society]], which publishes ''[[World Affairs (journal)|World Affairs]]'', the oldest U.S. journal on international relations.{{citation needed|date = May 2021}}

In addition to receiving the Nobel Prize, Root was awarded the Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)|Order of the Crown]] (from Belgium) and the Grand Commander of the [[Order of George I]] (from Greece).{{citation needed|date = May 2021}} Root joined the Empire State Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]] in 1895, based on his descent from Elihu Root (1772–1843), and was the second cousin twice removed of the publisher [[Henry Luce]].{{citation needed|date = May 2021}} Root was the last surviving member of the McKinley Cabinet and the last Cabinet member to have served in the 19th century.{{citation needed|date = May 2021}}

==Personal==

After getting established, in 1878 at the age of 33, Root married Clara Frances Wales (died in 1928). She was the daughter of Salem Wales, the managing editor of ''[[Scientific American]].'' They had three children: Edith (who married [[Ulysses S. Grant III]]), Elihu, Jr. (who became a lawyer), and Edward Wales Root (who became Professor of Art at Hamilton College).

Root was a member of the [[Union League Club of New York]] and twice served as its president, 1898–99, and again from 1915 to 1916. He also served as president of the [[New York City Bar Association]] from 1904 to 1905.

He became the president of the [[National Security League]] in 1917, succeeding his mentor [[Joseph Hodges Choate]]. Root spoke in favor of war and in opposition to women's suffrage as head of the league.<ref name=Marshall1997 />

==Death and legacy==
