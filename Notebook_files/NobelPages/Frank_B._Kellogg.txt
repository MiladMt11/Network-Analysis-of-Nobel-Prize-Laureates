===United States Senate===
In 1916, Kellogg was elected as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to the [[United States Senate]] from Minnesota and served from March 4, 1917 to March 4, 1923 in the [[65th United States Congress|65th]], [[66th United States Congress|66th]], and [[67th United States Congress|67th Congresses]].

==Secretary of State==

From 1925 to 1929, he served as the [[United States Secretary of State]] in the Cabinet of President Coolidge.<ref>{{cite news|title=SACASA PROTESTS KELLOGG'S COURSE; Said to Have Threatened in Message to Rouse Latin America Against Us.

As Secretary of State, he was responsible for improving [[Mexico–United States relations|U.S.–Mexican relations]] and helping to resolve the long-standing [[Tacna–Arica compromise|Tacna–Arica controversy]] between Peru and Chile.  His most significant accomplishment, however, was the [[Kellogg–Briand Pact]], signed in 1928. Proposed by its other namesake, French foreign minister [[Aristide Briand]], the treaty intended to provide for "the renunciation of war as an instrument of national policy." He was awarded the 1929 [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in recognition.<ref name="FBKbioguide"/><ref name="Pulitzer1930">{{cite news|last1=Times|first1=Wireless To The New York|title=KELLOGG TO GO TO OSLO.; But Nobel Peace Prize Winner Is Uncertain When He Can Pay Visit.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1930/11/29/archives/kellogg-to-go-to-oslo-but-nobel-peace-prize-winner-is-uncertain.html|access-date=May 13, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 29, 1930}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Times|first1=Wireless To The New York|title=Kellogg Gets Honorary Degree at Oxford; Outstanding Candidate for Nobel Peace Prize|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1929/11/27/archives/kellogg-gets-honorary-degree-at-oxford-outstanding-candidate-for.html|access-date=May 13, 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 27, 1929}}</ref>

Kellogg was self-conscious about his lack of academic credentials; he attended a one-room country school and dropped out at age 14. He never attended high school, college or law school.  His only advanced training came from clerking in a private lawyer's office. Kellogg grew up in a poor farm in Minnesota, and lacked a commanding presence or the sophistication to deal with the aristocrats who dominated European diplomacy. As Secretary of State, his main focus was Latin America, where he dealt with brutal but unsophisticated strongmen.  His staff provided the ideas, and they appreciated that he was always open, candid, and easy to communicate with. He helped end the battle between the Mexican government and the Catholic Church, but failed to resolve the dispute over ownership of the oil reserves. In the Far East,  he followed the advice of Nelson Johnson, the new chief of the Division of Far Eastern Affairs. They favored China and protected it from threats from Japan. They successfully negotiated tariff reform with China, thereby giving enhanced status to the Kuomintang and helping get rid of the [[unequal treaty|unequal treaties]].<ref>Russell D. Buhite, "Nelson Johnson and American Policy Toward China, 1925-1928." ''Pacific Historical Review'' (1966): 451-465 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3636978 online]. </ref> As for Europe he was primarily interested with expanding the limitations on naval armaments that been established by the [[Washington Naval Treaty|Washington Treaty]]; he made little progress. Kellogg gained international fame, and the Nobel Peace Prize, with the Kellogg–Briand Pact. It was endorsed by nearly every nation and made starting a war a punishable criminal action.  It formed the legal basis for the trial and execution of German and Japanese war leaders after 1945.<ref>Edward Mihalkanin, ed. (2004).
