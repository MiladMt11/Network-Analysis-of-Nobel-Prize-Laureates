==Biography==
E.J. Corey (the surname was anglicized from the [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] Arabic ''[[Khoury]]'', meaning ''priest'') was born to [[Lebanese Greek Orthodox Christians|Lebanese Greek Orthodox Christian]] immigrants in [[Methuen, Massachusetts]], {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Boston.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/1990/corey-autobio.html Elias James Corey – Autobiography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706111206/http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/1990/corey-autobio.html |date=July 6, 2008 }}. nobelprize.org</ref> His mother changed his name to "Elias" to honor his father, who died eighteen months after Corey's birth. His widowed mother, brother, two sisters, aunt and uncle all lived together in a spacious house, struggling through the [[Great Depression]]. As a young boy, Corey was independent and enjoyed sports such as baseball, football, and hiking. He attended a Catholic elementary school and [[Lawrence High School (Massachusetts)|Lawrence High School]] in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]].

At the age of 16 Corey entered [[MIT]], where he earned both a [[bachelor's degree]] in 1948 and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] under Professor [[John C. Sheehan]] in 1951. Upon entering MIT, Corey's only experience with science was in mathematics, and he began his college career pursuing a degree in engineering. After his first chemistry class in his sophomore year he began rethinking his long-term career plans and graduated with a bachelor's degree in chemistry. Immediately thereafter, at the invitation of Professor John C. Sheehan, Corey remained at MIT for his Ph.D. After his graduate career he was offered an appointment at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]], where he became a full professor of chemistry in 1956 at the age of 27. He was initiated as a member of the Zeta chapter of [[Alpha Chi Sigma]] at the University of Illinois in 1952.<ref name="alphachisigma.org">[http://www.alphachisigma.org/page.aspx?pid=268 Fraternity – Awards – Hall of Fame – Alpha Chi Sigma<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126172333/http://www.alphachisigma.org/page.aspx?pid=268 |date=January 26, 2016 }}</ref> In 1959, he moved to [[Harvard University]], where he is currently an emeritus professor of organic chemistry with an active Corey Group research program. He chose to work in organic chemistry because of "its intrinsic beauty and its great relevance to human health".<ref>{{cite news

==Major contributions==

===Reagents===
Corey has developed several new synthetic reagents:
*[[pyridinium chlorochromate|PCC (pyridinium chlorochromate)]], also referred to as the '''Corey-Suggs reagent''', is widely used for the oxidation of [[alcohol]]s to corresponding [[ketone]]s and [[aldehyde]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Corey | first1 = E.J. | last2 = Suggs | first2 = W. | year = 1975 | title   =Pyridinium chlorochromate. An efficient reagent for oxidation of primary and secondary alcohols to carbonyl compounds| journal = [[Tetrahedron Lett.]] | volume = 16 | issue = 31| pages = 2647–2650 | doi = 10.1016/s0040-4039(00)75204-x }}</ref> PCC has several advantages over other commercial oxidants. 
[[File:PCC mechanism.png|700px|center]]
One of these advantages is that the compound is available as an air-stable yellow solid that is not very hygroscopic. Unlike other oxidizing agents, PCC can accomplish single oxidations with only about 1.5 equivalents (scheme 1). The alcohol performs nucleophilic attack to the electropositive [[chromium]](VI) metal displacing chlorine. The [[chloride]] [[anion]] then acts as a base to afford the aldehyde product and chromium(IV). The slightly acidic character of PCC makes it useful for cyclization reactions with alcohols and [[alkene]]s (Scheme 2).<ref name="acidic chromium oxidation">{{cite journal | last1 = Corey | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Boger | first2 = D. | year = 1978 | title   =Oxidative cationic cyclization reactions effected by pyridinium chlorochromate| journal = Tetrahedron Lett. | volume = 19 | issue = 28| pages = 2461–2464 | doi=10.1016/s0040-4039(01)94800-2}}</ref>
[[File:PCC under acidic conditions2.png|700px|center|reactivity of PCC under acidic conditions]]
The initial oxidation yields the corresponding aldehyde, which can then undergo a [[Prins reaction]] with the neighboring [[alkene]]. After elimination and further oxidation, the product is a cyclic [[ketone]]. If this product is undesired, powdered [[sodium acetate]] can be used as a buffer to achieve only initial oxidation. The robustness of PCC as an oxidizing agent has also rendered it useful in the realm of total synthesis (Scheme 3). This example illustrates that PCC is capable of performing a ''Dauben oxidative rearrangement'' with tertiary alcohols through a [3,3]-sigmatropic rearrangement.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Yang | display-authors = etal   | year = 2010 | title   =Asymmetric Total Synthesis of Caribenol A| journal = JACS | volume = 132 | issue = 39| pages = 13608–13609 | doi = 10.1021/ja106585n | pmid = 20831198   }}</ref>

*''t''-Butyldimethylsilyl ether (TBS),<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Corey | first1 = E.

The development of these protecting groups allowed the synthesis of several [[natural product]]s that did not have the [[functional group]] compatibility to withstand standard chemical transformations. Although the synthetic community is now moving away from the use of protecting groups it is still rare that a published synthesis of a natural product omits them. Since 1972 the TBS group has become the most popular [[silicon]] protecting group. TBS is stable to [[chromatography]] and labile enough for cleavage under basic and acidic conditions. More importantly, TBS [[ether]]s are stable to some carbon nucleophiles such as Grignard reagents and enolates.<ref>Kocienski, P.J.

Other means of TBS deprotection include acids (also Lewis acids), and [[fluoride]]s. TIPS protecting groups were also pioneered by Corey and provide increased selectivity of primary alcohol protection over secondary and tertiary alcohol protection. TIPS ethers are more stable under acidic and basic conditions, the disadvantage of this protecting group over TBS ethers being that the group is less labile for deprotection.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Ogilvie | display-authors = etal   | year = 1974 | title   =Selective protection of hydroxyl groups in deoxynucleosides using alkylsilyl reagents.| journal = Tetrahedron Lett. | volume = 116 | issue = 33| pages = 2865–2868 | doi = 10.1016/s0040-4039(01)91764-2 }}</ref> The most common reagents used for cleavage employ the same conditions as TBS ether, but longer reaction times are generally needed.
[[File:Primary TIPS deprotection5.png|550px|center]]
Usually TBS ethers are severed by TBAF, but the hindered TBS ether above survives the reaction conditions upon primary TIPS removal (scheme 5).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kadota | display-authors = etal   | year = 1998 | title   =Stereocontrolled Total Synthesis of Hemibrevetoxin B| journal = J.

[[File:MEM Zn deprotection6.png|600px|center]]
*1,3-[[Dithiane]]s were pioneered by E.J. Corey in 1965 as a temporary modification of a [[carbonyl]] group in displacement and addition reactions. The formation of dithiane was the initial development that introduced [[Umpolung]] chemistry and is widely used for inversion of reactivity. The formations of dithianes can be accomplished with a Lewis acid (scheme 7) or directly from carbonyl compounds.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Corey | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Seebach | first2 = D. | year = 1965 | title   =Synthesis of 1,n-Dicarbonyl Derivates Using Carbanions from 1,3-Dithianes| journal = Angew. Chem. Int.

[[File:Dithiane formation7.png|350px|center]]
The pKa of dithianes is approximately 30, allowing deprotonation with an alkyl lithium reagent, typically [[n-butyllithium]]. The reaction with dithianes and aldehydes is now known as the [[Corey-Seebach reaction]]. The dithiane once deprotonated serves as an acyl anion used to attack incoming [[electrophile]]s. After deprotection of the dithiane, usually with HgO, a ketone product is observed from the masked acyl dithiane anion. The utility of such reactions has expanded the field of organic synthesis by allowing synthetic chemists to use Umpolung disconnections in total synthesis (scheme 8).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Corey | display-authors = etal   | year = 1982 | title   =Total synthesis of aplasmomycin| journal = JACS | volume = 104 | issue = 24| pages = 6818–6820 | doi = 10.1021/ja00388a074 }}</ref> 1,3-dithianes are also used as protecting groups for carbonyl compounds expressing the versatility and utility of this functional group. 
[[File:1,2-dithiane addition8.png|650px|center]]
*In addition, Corey commenced detailed studies on cationic polyolefin cyclizations utilized in enzymatic production of [[cholesterol]] from simpler plant terpenes.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wendt | first1 = K.U. | last2 = Schulz | first2 = G.E. | last3 = Liu | first3 = D.R. | last4 = Corey | first4 = E.J. | year = 2000 | title   =Enzyme Mechanisms for Polycyclic Triterpene Formation| journal = [[Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English]] | volume = 39 | issue = 16| pages = 2812–2833 | doi = 10.1002/1521-3773(20000818)39:16<2812::aid-anie2812>3.3.co;2-r | pmid = 11027983 }}</ref> Corey established the details of the remarkable cyclization process by first studying the biological synthesis of sterols from squalene.

===Methodology===

* [[Corey-Itsuno reduction]], also known as the Corey-Bakshi-Shibata reduction, is an enantioselective reduction of ketones to alcohols utilizing an oxazaborolidine [[Catalysis|catalyst]] and various boranes as the stoichiometric reductant.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Corey | first1 = E.

The reaction uses the chiral amino acid [[proline]] and in the presence of borane leads to the [[CBS catalyst]] (scheme 9).<ref name=reactions>Kürti, L.; Czakó, B.

[[File:CBS formation9.png|center|600px]]
Later, Corey demonstrated that substituted boranes were easier to prepare and much more stable. The reduction mechanism begins with the oxazoborolidine being only slightly basic at [nitrogen], coordinating with the stoichiometric borane of the boron amine complex(scheme 10).<ref name="enantioselective"/> Lack of donation from the nitrogen to the boron increases its Lewis acidity, allowing coordination with the ketone substrate. The complexation of the substrate occurs from the most accessible lone pair of the [[oxygen]] leading to restricted rotation around the B-O bond due to the sterically neighboring phenyl group.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Corey | first1 = E.J. | last2 = Bakshi | first2 = R.K. | last3 = Shibata | first3 = S. | year = 1987 | title   =Highly enantioselective borane reduction of ketones catalyzed by chiral oxazaborolidines.

[[File:CBS mechanism10.png|center|400px]]
Migration of the hydride from borane to the electrophilic ketone center occurs via a 6-membered ring transition state, leading to a four-membered ring intermediate ultimately providing the chiral product and regeneration of the catalyst. The reaction has also been of great use to natural products chemists (scheme 11).<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite journal | last1 = Corey | display-authors = etal   | year = 1987 | title   =A stable and easily prepared catalyst for the enantioselective reduction of ketones.

The alkoxy sulfonium salt is deprotonated at the alpha position with triethylamine to afford the oxidized product. The reaction accommodates a wide array of functional groups, but allylic and benzylic alcohols are typically transformed into allylic and benzylic chlorides. Its application in synthesis is based on the mild protocol conditions and functional and protecting group compatibility.

* CBS enantioselective [[Diels–Alder reaction|Diels-Alder reaction]] has been developed using a similar scaffold to the enantioselective CBS reduction.<ref name="enantioselective"/> After the development of this reaction the CBS reagent proved to be a very versatile reagent for a series of several powerful synthetic transformations. The use of a chiral Lewis acid such as the CBS catalyst includes a broad range of unsaturated [[enone]]s substrates. The reaction likely proceeds via a highly organized 6-membered ring pre-transition state to deliver highly enantio-enriched products (scheme 17).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Nair | display-authors = etal   | year = 2007 | title   =Intramolecular 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition reactions in targeted syntheses| journal = Tetrahedron | volume = 63 | issue = 50| pages = 12247–12275 | doi=10.1016/j.tet.2007.09.065}}</ref>

The reaction occurs in the presence of 2,2'-dipyridyl disulfide and triphenylphosphine. The reaction is generally refluxed in a nonpolar solvent such as [[benzene]]. The mechanism begins with formation of the 2-pyridinethiol ester (scheme 19). Proton-transfer provides a dipolar intermediate in which the alkoxide [[nucleophile]] attacks the electrophilic carbonyl center, providing a tetrahedral intermediate that yields the macrolactone product. One of the first examples of this protocol was applied to the total synthesis of [[zearalenone]] (scheme 20).<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Corey | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Nicolaou | first2 = K.

Based on their reactivity, another distinct advantage of these two variants is that kinetically they provide a difference in diastereoselectivity. The reaction is very well established, and enantioselective variants (catalytic and stoichiometric) have also been achieved. From a retrosynthetic analysis standpoint, this reaction provides a reasonable alternative to conventional epoxidation reactions with alkenes (scheme 22). Danishefsky utilized this methodology for the synthesis of taxol. Diastereoselectivity is established by 1,3 interactions in the transition state required for epoxide closure.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Danishefsky | display-authors = etal   | year = 1996 | title   =Total Synthesis of Baccatin III and Taxol| journal = JACS | volume = 118 | issue = 12| pages = 2843–2859 | doi = 10.1021/ja952692a }}</ref>

E.; and Schneider, W. P. (1973) p. 81 in ''The Total Synthesis of Natural Products'', Vol. 1, ApSimon, J. W. (ed.) Wiley, New York.</ref> Specifically the synthesis of Prostaglandin F<sub>2α</sub> presents several challenges. The presence of both ''cis'' and ''trans'' olefins as well as five asymmetric carbon atoms renders the molecule a desirable challenge for organic chemists. Corey's retrosynthetic analysis outlines a few key disconnections that lead to simplified precursors (scheme 23). 
[[File:Prostaglandin retro23.png|600px|center]]
Molecular simplification began first by disconnecting both carbon chains with a Wittig reaction and Horner-Wadsworth Emmons modification. The Wittig reaction affords the ''cis'' product, while the Horner-Wadsworth Emmons produces the ''trans'' olefin. The published synthesis reveals a 1:1 diastereomeric mixture of the carbonyl reduction using zinc borohydride. However, years later Corey and co-workers established the CBS reduction. One of the examples that exemplified this protocol was an intermediate in the prostaglandin synthesis revealing a 9:1 mixture of the desired diastereomer (scheme 24).<ref name="ReferenceA"/> 
[[File:Prostoglandin CBS24.png|500px|center]]
The iodolactonization transform affords an allylic alcohol leading to a key Baeyer-Villiger intermediate. This oxidation regioselectively inserts an oxygen atom between the ketone and the most electron-rich site. The pivotal intermediate leads to a straightforward conversion to the Diels-Alder structural goal, which provides the carbon framework for the functionalized cyclopentane ring. Later Corey developed an asymmetric Diels-Alder reaction employing a chiral oxazoborolidine, greatly simplifying the synthetic route to the prostaglandins.

==Woodward–Hoffmann rules==
When awarded the Priestley Medal in 2004, E. J. Corey created a controversy with his claim to have inspired [[Robert Burns Woodward]] prior to the development of the [[Woodward–Hoffmann rules]]. Corey wrote:

''"On May 4, 1964, I suggested to my colleague R. B. Woodward a simple explanation involving the symmetry of the perturbed (HOMO) molecular orbitals for the stereoselective cyclobutene → 1,3-butadiene and 1,3,5-hexatriene → cyclohexadiene conversions that provided the basis for the further development of these ideas into what became known as the Woodward–Hoffmann rules."''<ref>See the E.

Corey mentions that he made the Priestley statement ''"so the historical record would be correct"''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnson |first=Carolyn Y. |title=Whose idea was it? |work=Boston Globe |date=March 1, 2005 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/health_science/articles/2005/03/01/whose_idea_was_it?pg=2 |access-date=September 10, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111165854/http://www.boston.com/news/globe/health_science/articles/2005/03/01/whose_idea_was_it?pg=2 |archive-date=January 11, 2012 }}

Corey's claim and contribution were publicly rebutted by [[Roald Hoffmann]] in the journal ''[[Angewandte Chemie]]''.  In the rebuttal, Hoffmann states that he asked Corey over the course of their long discussion of the matter why Corey did not make the issue public.  Corey responded that he thought such a public disagreement would hurt Harvard and that he would not "consider doing anything against Harvard, to which I was and am so devoted." Corey also hoped that Woodward himself would correct the historical record "as he grew older, more considerate, and more sensitive to his own conscience."<ref>{{cite journal
