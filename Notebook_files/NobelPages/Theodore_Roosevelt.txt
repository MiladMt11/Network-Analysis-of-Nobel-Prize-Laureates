R.''', was an American politician, statesman, conservationist, naturalist, historian, and writer who served as the 26th [[president of the United States]] from 1901 to 1909. He previously served as the 25th [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]] under [[William McKinley]] from March to September 1901, and as the 33rd [[governor of New York]] from 1899 to 1900. Having assumed the presidency after [[Assassination of William McKinley|McKinley's assassination]], Roosevelt emerged as a leader of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and became a driving force for [[United States antitrust law|anti-trust]] and [[Progressive Era|Progressive]] policies.

Roosevelt was a sickly child with debilitating [[asthma]] but partly overcame his health problems by embracing [[The Strenuous Life|a strenuous lifestyle]]. He integrated his exuberant personality, a vast range of interests and achievements into a "cowboy" persona defined by robust masculinity. He was home-schooled and began a lifelong naturalist avocation before attending [[Harvard College|Harvard]]. His book ''[[The Naval War of 1812]]'' (1882) established his reputation as a learned historian and popular writer. Upon entering politics, he became the leader of the reform faction of Republicans in [[New York State Legislature|New York's state legislature]]. His wife and mother both died in the same night and he was psychologically devastated. He recuperated by buying and operating a cattle ranch in the Dakotas. He served as [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] under President [[William McKinley]] and in 1898 helped plan the [[Spanish–American War|highly successful naval war against Spain.]] He resigned to help form and lead the [[Rough Riders]], a unit that fought the Spanish army in Cuba to great publicity. Returning a war hero, he was [[1898 New York state election|elected governor of New York]] in 1898.  The New York state party leadership disliked his ambitious agenda and convinced McKinley to make Roosevelt as his running mate in the [[1900 United States presidential election|1900 election]]. Roosevelt campaigned vigorously, and the McKinley–Roosevelt ticket won a landslide victory based on a platform of victory, peace and prosperity.

Roosevelt assumed the presidency at age 42 after [[Assassination of William McKinley|McKinley was assassinated]] in September 1901. He remains the [[List of presidents of the United States by age|youngest person to become President of the United States]]. Roosevelt was a leader of the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive movement]] and championed his "[[Square Deal]]" domestic policies, promising the average citizen fairness, breaking of [[Trust (business)|trusts]], regulation of railroads, and pure food and drugs. He prioritized [[Conservation movement|conservation]] and established [[List of national parks of the United States|national parks]], [[List of national forests of the United States|forests]], and [[List of national monuments of the United States|monuments]] intended to preserve the nation's natural resources. In foreign policy, he [[Roosevelt Corollary|focused on Central America]] where he began construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. He expanded the [[United States Navy|Navy]] and sent the [[Great White Fleet]] on a world tour to project American naval power. His successful efforts to broker the end of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] won him the 1906 [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. Roosevelt was elected to a full term in [[1904 United States presidential election|1904]] and continued to promote [[Progressivism|progressive]] policies. He groomed his close friend [[William Howard Taft]] to succeed him in the [[1908 United States presidential election|1908 presidential election]].

Roosevelt grew frustrated with Taft's brand of conservatism and belatedly tried to win the [[1912 Republican Party presidential primaries|1912 Republican nomination for president]]. He failed, walked out, and founded the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]]. He ran in the [[1912 United States presidential election|1912 presidential election]] and the split allowed the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Woodrow Wilson]] to win the election. Following the defeat, Roosevelt led a [[Roosevelt–Rondon Scientific Expedition|two-year expedition to the Amazon basin]] where he nearly died of tropical disease. During [[World War I]], he criticized Wilson for keeping the country out of the war; his offer to lead volunteers to France was rejected. He considered running for president again in [[1920 United States presidential election|1920]], but his health continued to deteriorate. He died in 1919. He is generally ranked in [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|polls of historians and political scientists]] as one of the five best presidents.

Theodore Roosevelt Jr. was born on October 27, 1858, at [[Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site|28 East 20th Street]] in [[Manhattan]], New York City.{{sfn|Morris|1979|p=3}} He was the second of four children born to socialite [[Martha Bulloch Roosevelt|Martha Stewart "Mittie" Bulloch]] and businessman and philanthropist [[Theodore Roosevelt Sr.]] He had an older sister ([[Bamie Roosevelt|Anna]], nicknamed "Bamie"), a younger brother ([[Elliott Bulloch Roosevelt|Elliott]]) and a younger sister ([[Corinne Roosevelt Robinson|Corinne]]).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Anna Roosevelt – Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site (U.S. National Park Service)|url=https://www.nps.gov/thrb/learn/historyculture/annaroosevelt.htm|access-date=April 4, 2021|publisher=National Park Service}}</ref> Elliott was later the father of First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt|Anna Eleanor Roosevelt]], the wife of Theodore's distant cousin, President [[Franklin D.

Roosevelt]] and Margaret Barnhill as well as a brother of [[Robert Roosevelt]] and [[James A. Roosevelt]]. Theodore's fourth cousin, [[James Roosevelt I]], who was also a businessman, was the father of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Mittie was the younger daughter of Major [[James Stephens Bulloch]] and Martha P. "Patsy" Stewart.{{Sfn|Putnam|1958|loc=ch 1–2}} Through the Van Schaacks, Roosevelt was a descendant of the [[Schuyler family]].<ref>Genealogy of the Oyster Bay Roosevelts. ''Almanac of Theodore Roosevelt'' [http://www.theodore-roosevelt.com/trfamily.html online] Accessed March 14, 2015.</ref>

Roosevelt's youth was largely shaped by his poor health and debilitating [[asthma]]. He repeatedly experienced sudden nighttime asthma attacks that caused the experience of being smothered to death, which terrified both Theodore and his parents. Doctors had no cure.{{Sfn|McCullough|1981|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nuzmvrqPvdIC&pg=PA93 93–108]}} Nevertheless, he was energetic and mischievously inquisitive.{{Sfn|Putnam|1958|pp=23–27}} His lifelong interest in zoology began at age seven when he saw a dead [[Pinniped|seal]] at a local market; after obtaining the seal's head, Roosevelt and two cousins formed what they called the "Roosevelt Museum of Natural History". Having learned the rudiments of [[taxidermy]], he filled his makeshift museum with animals that he killed or caught; he then studied the animals and prepared them for exhibition. At age nine, he recorded his observation of insects in a paper entitled "The Natural History of Insects".<ref name="environment">{{Citation | publisher = PBS | url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/tr/envir.html | title = TR's Legacy — The Environment | access-date = March 6, 2006}}.</ref>

Roosevelt's father significantly influenced him. His father was a prominent leader in New York's cultural affairs; he helped to found the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], and had been especially active in mobilizing support for the [[Union Army|Union]] during the Civil War, even though his in-laws included [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] leaders. Roosevelt said, "My father, Theodore Roosevelt, was the best man I ever knew. He combined strength and courage with gentleness, tenderness, and great unselfishness. He would not tolerate in us children selfishness or cruelty, idleness, cowardice, or untruthfulness." Family trips abroad, including tours of [[Europe]] in 1869 and 1870, and [[Egypt]] in 1872, shaped his cosmopolitan perspective.{{Sfn|Roosevelt|1913|p=13}} Hiking with his family in the [[Alps]] in 1869, Roosevelt found that he could keep pace with his father. He had discovered the significant benefits of physical exertion to minimize his asthma and bolster his spirits.{{Sfn|Putnam|1958|pp=63–70}} Roosevelt began a heavy regime of exercise. After being manhandled by two older boys on a camping trip, he found a boxing coach to teach him to fight and strengthen his body.{{Sfn|Thayer|1919|p=20}}<ref>Arnaldo Testi, "The gender of reform politics: Theodore Roosevelt and the culture of masculinity."

Roosevelt was [[Homeschooling|homeschooled]], mostly by tutors and his parents.<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Topics in History: Teddy Roosevelt|url=https://homeschoollifemag.com/blog/topics-in-history-teddy-roosevelt|access-date=April 4, 2021|magazine=home / school / life}}</ref> Biographer [[H.

He did well in science, philosophy, and rhetoric courses but continued to struggle in Latin and Greek. He studied biology intently and was already an accomplished naturalist and a published [[Ornithology|ornithologist]]. He read prodigiously with an almost photographic memory.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=62}} While at Harvard, Roosevelt participated in rowing and [[Harvard Boxing Club|boxing]]; he was once runner-up in a Harvard boxing tournament.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9trgvNHupVoC&pg=PA74|title=Cold Warriors: Manliness on Trial in the Rhetoric of the West|first=Suzanne|last=Clark|year=2000|publisher=SIU Press|isbn=978-0-8093-2302-9}}</ref> Roosevelt was a member of the [[Alpha Delta Phi]] literary society (later the [[Fly Club]]), the [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity, and the prestigious [[Porcellian Club]]; he was also an editor of ''[[The Harvard Advocate]]''. In 1880, Roosevelt graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] (22nd of 177) from Harvard with an [[Bachelors of Arts|A.B.]] ''[[magna cum laude]]''. Biographer Henry Pringle states:
{{quote|Roosevelt, attempting to analyze his college career and weigh the benefits he had received, felt that he had obtained little from Harvard.

After his father's death, Roosevelt had inherited $65,000 ({{Inflation|US|65000|1878|r=0|fmt=eq|cursign=$}}), enough to live off comfortably for the rest of his life.<ref name=NYT14>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2014/07/18/1878-theodore-roosevelt-inherits-a-fortune/|title=First Glimpses: 1878: Theodore Roosevelt Inherits a Fortune|date=July 18, 2014|author=Mark Bulik|work=[[The New York Times]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201222113116/https://www.nytimes.com/times-insider/2014/07/18/1878-theodore-roosevelt-inherits-a-fortune/|access-date=December 22, 2020|archive-date=December 22, 2020}}</ref> Roosevelt gave up his earlier plan of studying natural science and instead decided to attend [[Columbia Law School]], moving back into his family's home in New York City. Roosevelt was an able law student, but he often found law to be irrational. He spent much of his time writing a book on the [[War of 1812]].{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=110–212, 123–133. quote p. 126}}

Determined to enter politics, Roosevelt began attending meetings at Morton Hall, the 59th Street headquarters of New York's 21st District Republican Association. Though Roosevelt's father had been a prominent member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], the younger Roosevelt made an unorthodox career choice for someone of his class, as most of Roosevelt's peers refrained from becoming too closely involved in politics. Roosevelt found allies in the local Republican Party, and he defeated an incumbent Republican state assemblyman closely tied to the political machine of Senator [[Roscoe Conkling]]. After his election victory, Roosevelt decided to drop out of law school, later saying, "I intended to be one of the governing class."{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=110–112, 123–133. quote p. 126}}

===Naval history and strategy===
While at Harvard, Roosevelt began a systematic study of the role played by the young [[United States Navy]] in the War of 1812.{{Sfn|Roosevelt|1913|p=35}}{{Sfn|Morris|1979|p=565}} Assisted by two uncles, he scrutinized original source materials and official U.S. Navy records, ultimately publishing ''[[The Naval War of 1812]]'' in 1882. The book contained drawings of individual and combined ship maneuvers, charts depicting the differences in iron throw weights of cannon shot between rival forces, and analyses of the differences and similarities between British and American leadership down to the ship-to-ship level. Upon release, ''The Naval War of 1812'' was praised for its scholarship and style, and it remains a standard study of the war.<ref name="mjcrawford1">{{cite journal|last1=Crawford|first1=Michael J.|title=The Lasting Influence of Theodore Roosevelt's Naval War of 1812|journal=International Journal of Naval History|date=April 2002|volume=1|issue=1|url=http://www.ijnhonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/pdf_crawford.pdf|access-date=October 6, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713113248/http://www.ijnhonline.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/pdf_crawford.pdf|archive-date=July 13, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

With the publication of ''[[The Influence of Sea Power upon History]], 1660–1783'' in 1890, Navy Captain [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] was immediately hailed as the world's outstanding naval theorist by the leaders of Europe. Roosevelt paid very close attention to Mahan's emphasis that only a nation with the world's most powerful fleet could dominate the world's oceans, exert its diplomacy to the fullest, and defend its own borders.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2711707|title = The Nature of "Influence": Roosevelt, Mahan and the Concept of Sea Power|journal = American Quarterly|volume = 23|issue = 4|pages = 585–600|last1 = Karsten|first1 = Peter|year = 1971|doi = 10.2307/2711707}}</ref><ref>Richard W.

In 1880, Roosevelt married socialite [[Alice Hathaway Lee Roosevelt|Alice Hathaway Lee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theodorerooseveltcenter.org/Research/Digital-Library/Record/ImageViewer?libID=o288503&imageNo=46|title=TR Center – ImageViewer}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theodorerooseveltcenter.org/Research/Digital-Library/Record/ImageViewer?libID=o278913&imageNo=1|title=TR Center – ImageViewer}}</ref> Their daughter, [[Alice Roosevelt Longworth|Alice Lee Roosevelt]], was born on February 12, 1884. Two days later, the new mother died of an undiagnosed case of [[kidney failure]] that had been masked by the pregnancy. In his diary, Roosevelt wrote a large 'X' on the page and then, "The light has gone out of my life." His mother, Mittie, had died of [[typhoid fever]] eleven hours earlier at 3:00&nbsp;a.m., in the same house on 57th Street in Manhattan. Distraught, Roosevelt left baby Alice in the care of his sister Bamie while he grieved;{{sfn|Miller|1992|pp=154–158}} he assumed custody of Alice when she was three.{{sfn|Miller|1992}}{{page needed|date=November 2020}}

After the deaths of his wife and mother, Roosevelt focused on his work, specifically by re-energizing a legislative investigation into corruption of the New York City government, which arose from a concurrent bill proposing that power be centralized in the mayor's office.{{sfn|Brands|1997|p=166}} For the rest of his life, he rarely spoke about his wife Alice and did not write about her in his autobiography.{{Sfn|Morris|1979|p=232}}

==Early political career==
===State Assemblyman===
[[File:TR NY State Assemblyman 1883 crop.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Roosevelt as New York State Assemblyman, 1883]]

Roosevelt was a member of the [[New York State Assembly]] (New York Co., 21st D.) in [[105th New York State Legislature|1882]], [[106th New York State Legislature|1883]] and [[107th New York State Legislature|1884]].<ref name=":1" /> He immediately began making his mark, specifically in corporate corruption issues.<ref name=":1">Edward P. Kohn, "Theodore Roosevelt's Early Political Career: The Making of an Independent Republican and Urban Progressive" in Ricard, ''A Companion to Theodore Roosevelt'' (2011) pp: 27–44.</ref> He blocked a corrupt effort by financier [[Jay Gould]] to lower his taxes. Roosevelt exposed suspected collusion in the matter by Judge [[Theodoric R. Westbrook|Theodore Westbrook]], and argued for and received approval for an investigation to proceed, aiming for the impeachment of the judge. The investigation committee rejected impeachment, but Roosevelt had exposed the potential corruption in Albany, and thus assumed a high and positive political profile in multiple New York publications.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=134–140}}

Roosevelt's [[anti-corruption]] efforts helped him win re-election in [[1882 New York state election|1882]] by a margin greater than two-to-one, an achievement made even more impressive by the fact that Democratic gubernatorial candidate [[Grover Cleveland]] won Roosevelt's district.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=138–139}} With Conkling's [[Stalwart (politics)|Stalwart]] faction of the Republican Party in disarray following the [[Assassination of James A. Garfield|assassination]] of President [[James Garfield]], Roosevelt won election as the Republican party leader in the state assembly. He allied with Governor Cleveland to win passage of a civil service reform bill.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=140–142}} Roosevelt won re-election a second time, and sought the office of [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly]], but was defeated by [[Titus Sheard]] in a 41 to 29 vote of the GOP caucus.<ref>{{Citation | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1884/01/01/106134466.pdf | title = Mr Sheard to be Speaker | newspaper = The New York Times | date = January 1, 1884}}.</ref>{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=153}} In his final term, Roosevelt served as Chairman of the Committee on Affairs of Cities; he wrote more bills than any other legislator.<ref>Edward P.

===Presidential election of 1884===
{{See also|1884 United States presidential election}}

With numerous presidential hopefuls to choose from, Roosevelt supported Senator [[George F. Edmunds]] of Vermont, a colorless reformer. The state GOP preferred the incumbent president, New York City's [[Chester Arthur]], who was known for passing the [[Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act]]. Arthur, at the time, was suffering from [[Bright's disease]], unknown to the public, and out of duty he did not contest his own nomination. Roosevelt fought hard and succeeded in influencing the Manhattan delegates at the state convention in Utica. He then took control of the state convention, bargaining through the night and outmaneuvering the supporters of Arthur and [[James G. Blaine]]; he gained a national reputation as a key person in New York State.{{sfn|Putnam|1958|pp=413–424}}

Roosevelt attended the 1884 [[1884 Republican National Convention|GOP National Convention]] in Chicago and gave a speech convincing delegates to nominate [[African American]] [[John R. Lynch]], an Edmunds supporter, to be temporary chair. Roosevelt fought alongside the [[Mugwump]] reformers; however, Blaine, having gained support from Arthur's and Edmunds's delegates, won the nomination by 541 votes on the fourth ballot. In a crucial moment of his budding political career, Roosevelt resisted the demand of the Mugwumps that he bolt from Blaine. He bragged about his one small success: "We achieved a victory in getting up a combination to beat the Blaine nominee for temporary chairman... To do this needed a mixture of skill, boldness and energy... to get the different factions to come in... to defeat the common foe."{{sfn|Brands|1997|p=171}} He was also impressed by an invitation to speak before an audience of ten thousand, the largest crowd he had addressed up to that date. Having gotten a taste of national politics, Roosevelt felt less aspiration for advocacy on the state level; he then retired to his new "Chimney Butte Ranch" on the [[Little Missouri River (North Dakota)|Little Missouri River]].{{sfn|Putnam|1958|pp=445–450}} Roosevelt refused to join other Mugwumps in supporting Grover Cleveland, the governor of New York and the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] nominee in the general election. He debated the pros and cons of staying loyal with his political friend, [[Henry Cabot Lodge]]. After Blaine won the nomination, Roosevelt had carelessly said that he would give "hearty support to any decent Democrat". He distanced himself from the promise, saying that it had not been meant "for publication".{{sfn|Pringle|1956|p=61}} When a reporter asked if he would support Blaine, Roosevelt replied, "That question I decline to answer. It is a subject I do not care to talk about."{{sfn|Putnam|1958|p=445}} In the end, he realized that he had to support Blaine to maintain his role in the GOP, and he did so in a press release on July 19.{{sfn|Putnam|1958|p=467}} Having lost the support of many reformers, Roosevelt decided to retire from politics and move to North Dakota.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=161}}

==Cattle rancher in Dakota==
[[File:TR Buckskin Tiffany Knife.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Theodore Roosevelt as [[Badlands]] hunter in 1885. New York studio photo.]]
Roosevelt first visited the [[Dakota Territory]] in 1883 to hunt [[bison]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Theodore Roosevelt the Rancher – Theodore Roosevelt National Park (U.S. National Park Service)|url=https://www.nps.gov/thro/learn/historyculture/theodore-roosevelt-the-rancher.htm|access-date=April 4, 2021|publisher=National Park Service}}</ref> Exhilarated by the [[western lifestyle]], and with the cattle business booming in the territory, Roosevelt invested $14,000 in hopes of becoming a prosperous cattle rancher. For the next several years, he shuttled between his home in New York and his ranch in Dakota.<ref>{{cite web |title=Theodore Roosevelt the Rancher |url=https://www.nps.gov/thro/learn/historyculture/theodore-roosevelt-the-rancher.htm |website=Theodore Roosevelt National Park, North Dakota |publisher=National Park Service |access-date=November 27, 2019}}</ref>

Following the 1884 presidential election, Roosevelt built a [[Elkhorn Ranch|ranch named Elkhorn]], which was {{cvt|35|mi|km}} north of the boomtown of [[Medora, North Dakota]]. Roosevelt learned to ride western style, rope, and hunt on the banks of the Little Missouri. Though he earned the respect of the authentic cowboys, they were not overly impressed.{{sfn|Brands|1997|p=182}} However, he identified with the herdsman of history, a man he said possesses "few of the emasculated, milk-and-water moralities admired by the pseudo-philanthropists; but he does possess, to a very high degree, the stern, manly qualities that are invaluable to a nation".<ref>{{cite book | first =Theodore | last = Roosevelt| title = Ranch Life and the Hunting Trail | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=BY4-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA56|year=1902 | publisher = Century |pages= 55–56| isbn = 978-0-486-47340-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| first =Will | last = Morrisey|title=The Dilemma of Progressivism: How Roosevelt, Taft, and Wilson Reshaped the American Regime of Self-Government| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oS2Kcqjl-VgC&pg=PA41 | year = 2009 |publisher= Rowman & Littlefield|page= 41 | isbn =978-0-7425-6618-7}}</ref> He reoriented, and began writing about frontier life for national magazines; he also published three books&nbsp;– ''Hunting Trips of a Ranchman'', ''Ranch Life and the Hunting-Trail'', and ''The Wilderness Hunter''.{{sfn|Brands|1997|p=191}}

Roosevelt brought his desire to address the common interests of citizens to the West. He successfully led efforts to organize ranchers to address problems of overgrazing and other shared concerns; his work resulted in the formation of the Little Missouri Stockmen's Association. He felt compelled to promote conservation and was able to form the [[Boone and Crockett Club]], whose primary goal was the conservation of large game animals and their habitats.{{sfn|Brands|1997|p=189}} After the uniquely severe US [[winter of 1886–87]] wiped out his herd of cattle and those of his competitors, and with it over half of his $80,000 investment, Roosevelt returned to the East.{{sfn|Morris|1979|p=376}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/thro/historyculture/theodore-roosevelt-the-rancher.htm|title=Theodore Roosevelt the Rancher|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=<!-- must have run out of pixels --> |website=nps.gov |publisher=National Park Service |access-date=January 13, 2015|quote=The blow proved disastrous for Roosevelt, who lost over half of his $80,000 investment, the equivalent of approximately $1.7 million today.}}</ref> Though his finances suffered from the experience, Roosevelt's time in the West made it impossible to peg him as an ineffectual intellectual, a characterization that could have hampered his political career.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=163–164}}

==Second marriage==
On December 2, 1886, Roosevelt married his childhood and family friend, [[Edith Roosevelt|Edith Kermit Carow]].{{sfn|Thayer|1919|pp=4, 6}} Roosevelt was deeply troubled that his second marriage had taken place so soon after the death of his first wife, and he faced resistance from his sisters.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=181–182}} Nonetheless, the couple married at [[St George's, Hanover Square]] in London, England.<ref>{{Citation | editor-first = S | editor-last = Gwynn | title = The Letters and Friendships | first = Sir Cecil Spring | last = Rice | publisher = Constable & Co | place = London | year = 1929 | page = 121}}.</ref> The couple had five children: [[Theodore Roosevelt Jr.|Theodore "Ted" III]] in 1887, [[Kermit Roosevelt|Kermit]] in 1889, [[Ethel Roosevelt Derby|Ethel]] in 1891, [[Archibald Roosevelt|Archibald]] in 1894, and [[Quentin Roosevelt|Quentin]] in 1897. The couple also raised Roosevelt's daughter from his first marriage, Alice, who often clashed with her stepmother.{{sfn|Miller|1992|pp=193–194}}

==Reentering public life==
Upon Roosevelt's return to New York in 1886, Republican leaders quickly approached him about running for [[mayor of New York City]] in [[1886 New York City mayoral election|the city's mayoral election]]. Roosevelt accepted the nomination despite having little hope of winning the race against [[Labor Party (United States, 19th century)|United Labor Party]] candidate [[Henry George]] and Democratic candidate [[Abram Hewitt]].{{sfn|Miller|1992|pp=183–185}} Roosevelt campaigned hard for the position, but Hewitt won with 41% (90,552 votes), taking the votes of many Republicans who feared George's radical policies.<ref name=everything/>{{sfn|Miller|1992|pp=183–185}} George was held to 31% (68,110 votes), and Roosevelt took third place with 27% (60,435 votes).<ref name=everything>{{cite book|last=Sharp|first=Arthur G.|title=The Everything Theodore Roosevelt Book: The Extraordinary Life of an American Icon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QSdqR6Wp31wC&pg=PA78|year=2011|publisher=Adams Media|pages=78–79|isbn=978-1-4405-2729-6}}</ref> Fearing that his political career might never recover, Roosevelt turned his attention to writing ''The Winning of the West'', a historical work tracking the westward movement of Americans; the book was a great success for Roosevelt, earning favorable reviews and selling numerous copies.{{sfn|Miller|1992|pp=197–200}}

===Civil Service Commission===
After [[Benjamin Harrison]] unexpectedly defeated Blaine for the presidential nomination at the [[1888 Republican National Convention]], Roosevelt gave [[Stump speech (politics)|stump speeches]] in the Midwest in support of Harrison.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=201}} On the insistence of Henry Cabot Lodge, President Harrison appointed Roosevelt to the [[United States Civil Service Commission]], where he served until 1895.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=203}} While many of his predecessors had approached the office as a sinecure,{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=206–207}} Roosevelt vigorously fought the [[spoils system|spoilsmen]] and demanded enforcement of civil service laws.{{Sfn|Thayer|1919|loc=ch.

{{Quote | The very citadel of spoils politics, the hitherto impregnable fortress that had existed unshaken since it was erected on the foundation laid by [[Andrew Jackson]], was tottering to its fall under the assaults of this audacious and irrepressible young man... Whatever may have been the feelings of the (fellow Republican party) President (Harrison)—and there is little doubt that he had no idea when he appointed Roosevelt that he would prove to be so veritable a bull in a china shop—he refused to remove him and stood by him firmly till the end of his term.{{Sfn|Bishop|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/?id=KPMEAAAAYAAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Theodore+Roosevelt+and+His+Time+Shown+in+His+Own+Letters#PPA2,M1 51]}}}}

===New York City Police Commissioner===
In 1894, a group of reform Republicans approached Roosevelt about running for Mayor of New York again; he declined, mostly due to his wife's resistance to being removed from the Washington social set. Soon after he declined, he realized that he had missed an opportunity to reinvigorate a dormant political career. He retreated to the Dakotas for a time; his wife Edith regretted her role in the decision and vowed that there would be no repeat of it.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=265–268}}

Roosevelt implemented regular inspections of firearms and annual physical exams, appointed recruits based on their physical and mental qualifications rather than political affiliation, established [[Meritorious Service Medal (United States)|Meritorious Service Medals]], and closed corrupt police hostelries. During his tenure, a Municipal Lodging House was established by the Board of Charities, and Roosevelt required officers to register with the Board; he also had telephones installed in station houses.<ref>Jay Stuart Berman, ''Police administration and progressive reform: Theodore Roosevelt as police commissioner of New York'' (1987)</ref>

In 1894, Roosevelt met [[Jacob Riis]], the [[muckraker|muckraking]] ''Evening Sun'' newspaper journalist who was opening the eyes of New Yorkers to the terrible conditions of the city's millions of poor immigrants with such books as ''[[How the Other Half Lives]].'' Riis described how his book affected Roosevelt:

{{quote|When Roosevelt read [my] book, he came... No one ever helped as he did. For two years we were brothers in (New York City's crime-ridden) [[Mulberry Street (Manhattan)|Mulberry Street]]. When he left I had seen its golden age... There is very little ease where Theodore Roosevelt leads, as we all of us found out. The lawbreaker found it out who predicted scornfully that he would "knuckle down to politics the way they all did", and lived to respect him, though he swore at him, as the one of them all who was stronger than pull... that was what made the age golden, that for the first time a moral purpose came into the street. In the light of it everything was transformed.<ref>{{Citation | last = Riis | first = Jacob A | title = The Making of an American | chapter = XIII | page = 3 | publisher = Bartleby}}.</ref>}}

Roosevelt made a habit of walking officers' [[Beat (police)|beats]] late at night and early in the morning to make sure that they were on duty.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=277}} He made a concerted effort to uniformly enforce New York's [[Blue law|Sunday closing law]]; in this, he ran up against boss [[Thomas C. Platt|Tom Platt]] as well as [[Tammany Hall]]—he was notified that the Police Commission was being legislated out of existence. His crackdowns led to protests and demonstrations.

In the [[1896 United States presidential election|1896 presidential election]], Roosevelt backed Speaker of the House [[Thomas Brackett Reed]] for the Republican nomination, but [[William McKinley]] won the nomination and defeated [[William Jennings Bryan]] in the general election.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=242–243}} Roosevelt opposed Bryan's [[free silver]] platform, viewing many of Bryan's followers as dangerous fanatics, and Roosevelt gave campaign speeches for McKinley.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=243–246}} Urged by Congressman Henry Cabot Lodge, President McKinley appointed Roosevelt as the [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] in 1897.<ref>{{Citation |first=David |last=Lemelin |title=Theodore Roosevelt as Assistant Secretary of the Navy: Preparing America for the World Stage |journal=History Matters |year=2011 |pages=13–34}}.</ref> Secretary of the Navy [[John D.

{{Quote |I would regard war with Spain from two viewpoints: first, the advisability on the grounds both of humanity and self-interest of interfering on behalf of the Cubans, and of taking one more step toward the complete freeing of America from European dominion; second, the benefit done our people by giving them something to think of which is not material gain, and especially the benefit done our military forces by trying both the Navy and Army in actual practice.{{Sfn|Roosevelt|2001|pp=157–158}}}}

On February 15, 1898, {{USS|Maine|ACR-1|6}}, an armored cruiser, exploded in the harbor of [[Havana, Cuba]], killing hundreds of crew members. While Roosevelt and many other Americans blamed Spain for the explosion, McKinley sought a diplomatic solution.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=267–268}} Without approval from Long or McKinley, Roosevelt sent out orders to several naval vessels, directing them to prepare for war.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=267–268}}{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=325–326}} [[George Dewey]], who had received an appointment to lead the [[Asiatic Squadron]] with the backing of Roosevelt, later credited his victory at the [[Battle of Manila Bay]] to Roosevelt's orders.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=261, 268}} After finally giving up hope of a peaceful solution, McKinley asked Congress to declare war upon Spain, beginning the [[Spanish–American War]].{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=271–272}}

===War in Cuba===
{{main|Rough Riders}}
[[File:Theodore Rooseveltnewtry.jpg|thumb|Colonel Theodore Roosevelt]]

With the beginning of the Spanish–American War in late April 1898, Roosevelt resigned from his post as Assistant Secretary of the Navy. Along with Army Colonel [[Leonard Wood]], he formed the [[Rough Riders|First US Volunteer Cavalry Regiment]].<ref name="LOC">{{cite web | url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/roughriders.html | title=The World of 1989: The Spanish–American War; Rough Riders | publisher=Library of Congress | access-date=February 7, 2015}}</ref> His wife and many of his friends begged Roosevelt to remain in his post in Washington, but Roosevelt was determined to see battle. When the newspapers reported the formation of the new regiment, Roosevelt and Wood were flooded with applications from all over the country.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=272–274}} Referred to by the press as the "Rough Riders", the regiment was one of many temporary units active only for the duration of the war.{{Sfn|Samuels|1997|p=148}}

The regiment trained for several weeks in [[San Antonio, Texas]], and in his autobiography, Roosevelt wrote that his prior experience with the [[New York National Guard]] had been invaluable, in that it enabled him to immediately begin teaching his men basic soldiering skills.<ref>{{cite book |last=Roosevelt |first=Theodore |date=2014 |title=Theodore Roosevelt: An Autobiography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TwHCAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA244 |location=Auckland, New Zealand |publisher=The Floating Press |page=244 |isbn=978-1-77653-337-4}}</ref> The Rough Riders used some standard issue gear and some of their own design, purchased with gift money. Diversity characterized the regiment, which included [[Ivy League]]rs, professional and amateur athletes, upscale gentlemen, cowboys, frontiersmen, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], hunters, miners, prospectors, former soldiers, tradesmen, and sheriffs. The Rough Riders were part of the cavalry division commanded by former Confederate general [[Joseph Wheeler]], which itself was one of three divisions in the V Corps under Lieutenant General [[William Rufus Shafter]]. Roosevelt and his men landed in [[Daiquirí]], Cuba, on June 23, 1898, and marched to [[Siboney, Cuba|Siboney]]. Wheeler sent parts of the 1st and 10th Regular Cavalry on the lower road northwest and sent the "Rough Riders" on the parallel road running along a ridge up from the beach. To throw off his infantry rival, Wheeler left one regiment of his Cavalry Division, the 9th, at Siboney so that he could claim that his move north was only a limited reconnaissance if things went wrong. Roosevelt was promoted to colonel and took command of the regiment when Wood was put in command of the brigade. The Rough Riders had a short, minor skirmish known as the [[Battle of Las Guasimas]]; they fought their way through Spanish resistance and, together with the Regulars, forced the Spaniards to abandon their positions.<ref name="The Rough Riders">{{Citation | last = Roosevelt | first = Theodore | author-link = Theodore Roosevelt | year = 1898 | chapter-url = http://www.bartleby.com/51/ | title = The Rough Riders | chapter = III | page = 2 | publisher = Bartleby}}.</ref>

Under his leadership, the Rough Riders became famous for the charge up [[Kettle Hill]] on July 1, 1898, while supporting the regulars. Roosevelt had the only horse, and rode back and forth between rifle pits at the forefront of the advance up Kettle Hill, an advance that he urged despite the absence of any orders from superiors. He was forced to walk up the last part of Kettle Hill because his horse had been entangled in barbed wire. The victories came at a cost of 200 killed and 1,000 wounded.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=356}}

In August, Roosevelt and other officers demanded that the soldiers be returned home. Roosevelt always recalled the Battle of Kettle Hill (part of the San Juan Heights) as "the great day of my life" and "my crowded hour". In 2001, Roosevelt was posthumously awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions;<ref name=MoH2001 /> he had been nominated during the war, but Army officials, annoyed at his grabbing the headlines, blocked it.{{Sfn|Samuels|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1v7PSGbzhDwC&pg=PA266 266]}} After returning to civilian life, Roosevelt preferred to be known as "Colonel Roosevelt" or "The Colonel", though "Teddy" remained much more popular with the public, even though Roosevelt openly despised that moniker.

After leaving Cuba in August 1898, the Rough Riders were transported to a camp at [[Montauk County Park|Montauk Point]], Long Island, where Roosevelt and his men were briefly quarantined due to the War Department's fear of spreading [[yellow fever]].{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=308–310}} Shortly after Roosevelt's return to the United States, Republican Congressman [[Lemuel E. Quigg]], a lieutenant of party boss Tom Platt, asked Roosevelt to run in the [[1898 New York state election|1898 gubernatorial election]]. Platt disliked Roosevelt personally, feared that Roosevelt would oppose Platt's interests in office, and was reluctant to propel Roosevelt to the forefront of national politics. However, Platt also needed a strong candidate due to the unpopularity of the incumbent Republican governor, [[Frank S. Black]], and Roosevelt agreed to become the nominee and to try not to "make war" with the Republican establishment once in office.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=310–311}} Roosevelt defeated Black in the Republican caucus by a vote of 753 to 218, and faced Democrat [[Augustus Van Wyck]], a well-respected judge, in the general election.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=318}} Roosevelt campaigned vigorously on his war record, winning the election by a margin of just one percent.{{Sfn|Morris|1979|pp=674–687}}

As governor, Roosevelt learned much about ongoing economic issues and political techniques that later proved valuable in his presidency. He was exposed to the problems of trusts, monopolies, labor relations, and conservation. Chessman argues that Roosevelt's program "rested firmly upon the concept of the square deal by a neutral state". The rules for the Square Deal were "honesty in public affairs, an equitable sharing of privilege and responsibility, and subordination of party and local concerns to the interests of the state at large".{{Sfn|Chessman|1965|p=6}}

By holding twice-daily press conferences—which was an innovation—Roosevelt remained connected with his middle-class political base.{{Sfn|Morris|1979|p=693}} Roosevelt successfully pushed the Ford Franchise-Tax bill, which taxed public franchises granted by the state and controlled by corporations, declaring that "a corporation which derives its powers from the State, should pay to the State a just percentage of its earnings as a return for the privileges it enjoys".<ref>{{cite book| first = Theodore | last = Roosevelt | title =The Roosevelt Policy: Speeches, Letters and State Papers, Relating to Corporate Wealth and Closely Allied Topics, of Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bJ8-AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA2 | year = 1908 |page= 2}}</ref> He rejected "boss" [[Thomas C. Platt]]'s worries that this approached Bryanite Socialism, explaining that without it, New York voters might get angry and adopt public ownership of streetcar lines and other franchises.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=378–379}}

The New York state government affected many interests, and the power to make appointments to policy-making positions was a key role for the governor. Platt insisted that he be consulted on major appointments; Roosevelt appeared to comply, but then made his own decisions. Historians marvel that Roosevelt managed to appoint so many first-rate men with Platt's approval. He even enlisted Platt's help in securing reform, such as in the spring of 1899, when Platt pressured state senators to vote for a civil service bill that the secretary of the Civil Service Reform Association called "superior to any civil service statute heretofore secured in America".{{Sfn|Chessman|1965|p=79}}

Chessman argues that as governor, Roosevelt developed the principles that shaped his presidency, especially insistence upon the public responsibility of large corporations, publicity as a first remedy for trusts, regulation of railroad rates, mediation of the conflict of capital and labor, conservation of natural resources and protection of the less fortunate members of society.{{Sfn|Chessman|1965|p=6}} Roosevelt sought to position himself against the excesses of large corporations on the one hand and radical movements on the other.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=322}}

As the chief executive of the most populous state in the union, Roosevelt was widely considered a potential future presidential candidate, and supporters such as [[William Allen White]] encouraged him to run for president.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=331–333}} Roosevelt had no interest in challenging McKinley for the Republican nomination in 1900, and was denied his preferred post of Secretary of War. As his term progressed, Roosevelt pondered a 1904 presidential run, but was uncertain about whether he should seek re-election as governor in 1900.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=333–334}}

===Vice Presidency (1901)===
{{Main |1900 United States presidential election}}

In November 1899, Vice President [[Garret Hobart]] died of heart failure, leaving an open spot on the 1900 Republican national ticket. Though Henry Cabot Lodge and others urged him to run for vice president in 1900, Roosevelt was reluctant to take the powerless position and issued a public statement saying that he would not accept the nomination.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=333–334, 338}} Additionally, Roosevelt was informed by President McKinley and campaign manager [[Mark Hanna]] that he was not being considered for the role of vice president due to his actions prior to the Spanish–American War. Eager to be rid of Roosevelt, Platt nonetheless began a newspaper campaign in favor of Roosevelt's nomination for the vice presidency.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=338}} Roosevelt attended the [[1900 Republican National Convention]] as a state delegate and struck a bargain with Platt: Roosevelt would accept the nomination for vice president if the convention offered it to him, but would otherwise serve another term as governor. Platt asked Pennsylvania party boss [[Matthew Quay]] to lead the campaign for Roosevelt's nomination, and Quay outmaneuvered Hanna at the convention to put Roosevelt on the ticket.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=340–341}} Roosevelt won the nomination unanimously.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=342}}

Roosevelt's vice-presidential campaigning proved highly energetic and an equal match for Democratic presidential nominee William Jennings Bryan's famous barnstorming style of campaigning. In a whirlwind campaign that displayed his energy to the public, Roosevelt made 480 stops in 23 states. He denounced the radicalism of Bryan, contrasting it with the heroism of the soldiers and sailors who fought and won the war against Spain. Bryan had strongly supported the war itself, but he denounced the annexation of the Philippines as imperialism, which would spoil America's innocence. Roosevelt countered that it was best for the Filipinos to have stability and the Americans to have a proud place in the world. With the nation basking in peace and prosperity, the voters gave McKinley an even larger victory than that which he had achieved in 1896.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=388–405}}<ref>John M. Hilpert, ''American Cyclone: Theodore Roosevelt and His 1900 Whistle-Stop Campaign'' (U Press of Mississippi, 2015).</ref>

After the campaign, Roosevelt took office as vice president in March 1901. The office of vice president was a powerless sinecure and did not suit Roosevelt's aggressive temperament.<ref>{{Citation | first = G Wallace | last = Chessman | title = Theodore Roosevelt's Campaign Against the Vice-Presidency | journal = Historian | year = 1952 | volume = 14 | number = 2 | pages = 173–190 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-6563.1952.tb00132.x}}.</ref> Roosevelt's six months as vice president were uneventful and boring for a man of action. He had no power; he presided over the Senate for a mere four days before it adjourned.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=346}} On September 2, 1901, Roosevelt first publicized an aphorism that thrilled his supporters: "[[Big Stick ideology|Speak softly and carry a big stick, and you will go far."]]<ref>{{cite news |last=Woltman |first=Nick |date=August 31, 2015 |title=Roosevelt's 'big stick' line at State Fair stuck...later |url=https://www.twincities.com/2015/08/31/roosevelts-big-stick-line-at-state-fair-stuck-later/ |work=[[Twin Cities Pioneer Press]] |access-date=June 9, 2020}}</ref>

==Presidency (1901–1909)==
{{Main |Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt}}
[[File:ROOSEVELT, Theodore-President (BEP engraved portrait) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Bureau of Engraving and Printing]] engraved portrait of Roosevelt as President]]

On September 6, 1901, President McKinley was attending the [[Pan-American Exposition]] in [[Buffalo, New York]] when he [[Assassination of William McKinley|was shot]] by anarchist [[Leon Czolgosz]]. Roosevelt was vacationing in Vermont, and traveled to Buffalo to visit McKinley in the hospital. It appeared that McKinley would recover, so Roosevelt resumed his vacation. When McKinley's condition worsened, Roosevelt again rushed back to Buffalo. McKinley died on September 14, and Roosevelt was informed while he was in [[North Creek, New York|North Creek]]; he continued on to Buffalo and was sworn in as the nation's 26th president at the [[Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site|Ansley Wilcox House]].{{sfn|Miller|1992|pp=348–352}}

McKinley's supporters were nervous about the new president, and Hanna was particularly bitter that the man he had opposed so vigorously at the convention had succeeded McKinley. Roosevelt assured party leaders that he intended to adhere to McKinley's policies, and he retained McKinley's Cabinet. Nonetheless, Roosevelt sought to position himself as the party's undisputed leader, seeking to bolster the role of the president and position himself for the 1904 election.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=354–356}}  The vice presidency remained vacant, as there was no constitutional provision for filling an intra-term vacancy in that office (prior to the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]] in 1967).

Shortly after taking office, Roosevelt invited [[Booker T. Washington]] to dinner at the [[White House]]. This sparked a bitter, and at times vicious, reaction among whites across the heavily segregated South.<ref>Dewey W. Grantham, "Dinner at the White House: Theodore Roosevelt, Booker T. Washington, and the South." ''Tennessee Historical Quarterly'' (1958) 17.2: 112-130 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/42621372 online].</ref>  Roosevelt reacted with astonishment and protest, saying that he looked forward to many future dinners with Washington. Upon further reflection, Roosevelt wanted to ensure that this had no effect on political support in the white South, and further dinner invitations to Washington were avoided;{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=422–423}} their next meeting was scheduled as typical business at 10:00&nbsp;a.m. instead.<ref>Edmund Morris, ''Theodore Rex'' p. 58</ref>

===Domestic policies===
====Trust busting and regulation====
[[File:Theodore Roosevelt by John Singer Sargent, 1903.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Official White House portrait by [[John Singer Sargent]]]]

For his aggressive use of the 1890 [[Sherman Antitrust Act]], compared to his predecessors, Roosevelt was hailed  as the "trust-buster"; but in reality he was more of a trust regulator.{{sfn|Ruddy|2016}} Roosevelt viewed big business as a necessary part of the American economy, and sought only to prosecute the "bad trusts" that restrained trade and charged unfair prices.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=365–366}} He brought 44 antitrust suits, breaking up the [[Northern Securities Company]], the largest railroad monopoly; and regulating [[Standard Oil]], the largest oil company.<ref>{{cite book|title=American Entrepreneur: The Fascinating Stories of the People Who Defined Business in the United States| publisher= AMACOM Div American Mgmt Assn | year = 2009|first=Larry|last = Schweikart}}</ref>{{sfn|Ruddy|2016}} Presidents Benjamin Harrison, Grover Cleveland, and William McKinley combined had prosecuted only 18 antitrust violations under the Sherman Antitrust Act.{{sfn|Ruddy|2016}}

Bolstered by his party's winning large majorities in the [[1902 United States elections|1902 elections]], Roosevelt proposed the creation of the [[United States Department of Commerce and Labor]], which would include the [[Bureau of Corporations]]. While Congress was receptive to the Department of Commerce and Labor, it was more skeptical of the antitrust powers that Roosevelt sought to endow within the Bureau of Corporations. Roosevelt successfully appealed to the public to pressure Congress, and Congress overwhelmingly voted to pass Roosevelt's version of the bill.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=378–381}}

In a moment of frustration, House Speaker [[Joseph Gurney Cannon]] commented on Roosevelt's desire for executive branch control in domestic policy-making: "That fellow at the other end of the avenue wants everything from the birth of Christ to the death of the devil." Biographer Brands states, "Even his friends occasionally wondered whether there wasn't any custom or practice too minor for him to try to regulate, update or otherwise improve."{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=552–553}} In fact, Roosevelt's willingness to exercise his power included attempted rule changes in the game of [[American football|football]]; at the Naval Academy, he sought to force retention of martial arts classes and to revise disciplinary rules. He even ordered changes made in the minting of a coin whose design he disliked, and ordered the Government Printing Office to adopt simplified spellings for a core list of 300 words, according to reformers on the [[Simplified Spelling Board]]. He was forced to rescind the latter after substantial ridicule from the press and a resolution of protest from the House of Representatives.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=553–556}}

====Coal strike====
{{main|Coal strike of 1902}}
In May 1902, [[United Mine Workers|anthracite coal miners]] went on strike, threatening a national energy shortage. After threatening the coal operators with intervention by federal troops, Roosevelt won their agreement to dispute arbitration by a commission, which succeeded in stopping the strike. The accord with [[J. P. Morgan]] resulted in the miners getting more pay for fewer hours, but with no union recognition.<ref>{{Citation | first = William Henry | last = Harbaugh | title = Power and Responsibility: Theodore Roosevelt | year=1963|pages=165–179}}.</ref>{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=450–483}} Roosevelt said, "My action on labor should always be considered in connection with my action as regards capital, and both are reducible to my favorite formula—a square deal for every man."{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=509}} Roosevelt was the first president to help settle a labor dispute.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=376–377}}

====Prosecuted misconduct====
During Roosevelt's second year in office it was discovered there was corruption in the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs|Indian Service]], the [[General Land Office|Land Office]], and the [[United States Postal Service|Post Office Department]]. Roosevelt investigated and prosecuted corrupt Indian agents who had cheated the Creeks and various tribes out of land parcels. Land fraud and speculation were found involving Oregon federal timberlands. In November 1902, Roosevelt and Secretary [[Ethan A. Hitchcock (Interior)|Ethan A. Hitchcock]] forced [[Binger Hermann]], the General Land Office Commissioner, to resign from office. On November 6, 1903 [[Francis J. Heney]] was appointed special prosecutor and obtained 146 indictments involving an [[Oregon]] Land Office bribery ring. U.S. Senator [[John H. Mitchell]] was indicted for bribery to expedite illegal land patents, found guilty in July 1905, and sentenced to six months in prison.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|p=207}} More corruption was found in the Postal Department, that brought on the indictments of 44 government employees on charges of bribery and fraud.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|p=208}} Historians generally agree that Roosevelt moved "quickly and decisively" to prosecute misconduct in his administration.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|p=209}}

====Railroads====
{{Main|Hepburn Act}}
Merchants complained that some railroad rates were too high. In the 1906 [[Hepburn Act]], Roosevelt sought to give the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] the power to regulate rates, but the Senate, led by conservative [[Nelson Aldrich]], fought back. Roosevelt worked with the Democratic Senator [[Benjamin Tillman]] to pass the bill. Roosevelt and Aldrich ultimately reached a compromise that gave the ICC the power to replace existing rates with "just-and-reasonable" maximum rates, but allowed railroads to appeal to the federal courts on what was "reasonable".{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=453–459}}<ref>John Morton Blum, ''The Republican Roosevelt'' (2nd ed. 1977) pp. 89–117</ref> In addition to rate-setting, the Hepburn Act also granted the ICC regulatory power over pipeline fees, storage contracts, and several other aspects of railroad operations.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 445–448</ref>

====Pure food and drugs====
Roosevelt responded to public anger over the abuses in the food packing industry by pushing Congress to pass the [[Meat Inspection Act]] of 1906 and the [[Pure Food and Drug Act]]. Though conservatives initially opposed the bill, [[Upton Sinclair]]'s ''[[The Jungle]]'', published in 1906, helped galvanize support for reform.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=459–460}} The Meat Inspection Act of 1906 banned misleading labels and preservatives that contained harmful chemicals. The Pure Food and Drug Act banned food and drugs that were impure or falsely labeled from being made, sold, and shipped. Roosevelt also served as honorary president of the [[American School Hygiene Association]] from 1907 to 1908, and in 1909 he convened the first [[White House]] Conference on the Care of Dependent Children.<ref name = "ProgHealth21">{{cite book|title=The progressive era's health reform movement: a historical dictionary| first1 = Ruth C.|last1=Engs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mNeGQRBgd_MC |pages=20–22|publisher=Praeger |year = 2003 | location =Westport, CT|isbn= 0-275-97932-6}}</ref>

====Conservation====

Of all Roosevelt's achievements, he was proudest of his work in the conservation of natural resources and extending federal protection to land and wildlife.<ref>Bakari, Mohamed El-Kamel.

He also established the first 51 [[bird reserve]]s, four [[game preservation|game preserves]], and 150 [[United States National Forest|National Forests]]. The area of the United States that he placed under public protection totals approximately {{convert|230|e6acre|km2|sp=us|abbr=off}}.<ref>Douglas Brinkley, ''The Wilderness Warrior: Theodore Roosevelt and the Crusade for America'' (2010)</ref>

Roosevelt extensively used [[Executive order (United States)|executive orders]] on a number of occasions to protect forest and wildlife lands during his tenure as president.<ref>{{cite book |title=Executing the Constitution: Putting the President Back Into the Constitution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qgzmexCI734C&pg=PA53 |year=2006 |publisher=State University of New York Press |page=53 |isbn=978-0-7914-8190-5 }}</ref> By the end of his second term in office, Roosevelt used executive orders to establish {{convert|150|e6acre|km2|sigfig=1|abbr=off|sp=us}} of reserved forestry land.<ref name="Take up Your Pen">{{cite book|last1=Dodds|first1=Graham|title=Take up Your Pen|date=2013|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|isbn=978-0-8122-4511-0|page=144}}</ref> Roosevelt was unapologetic about his extensive use of executive orders to protect the environment, despite the perception in Congress that he was encroaching on too many lands.<ref name="Take up Your Pen"/> Eventually, Senator [[Charles William Fulton|Charles Fulton]] (R-OR) attached an amendment to an agricultural appropriations bill that effectively prevented the president from reserving any further land.<ref name="Take up Your Pen"/> Before signing that bill into law, Roosevelt used executive orders to establish an additional 21 forest reserves, waiting until the last minute to sign the bill into law.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite book|last1=Dodds|first1=Graham|title=Take up Your Pen|date=2013|publisher=University of Pennsylvania|isbn=978-0-8122-4511-0|page=146}}</ref> In total, Roosevelt used executive orders to establish 121 forest reserves in 31 states.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Prior to Roosevelt, only one president had issued over 200 executive orders, Grover Cleveland (253).

===Foreign policy===
{{Main|Foreign policy of the Theodore Roosevelt administration}}

==== Japan ====
The American annexation of Hawaii in 1898 was stimulated in part by fear that otherwise Japan would dominate the Hawaiian Republic.<ref>William Michael Morgan, "The anti-Japanese origins of the Hawaiian Annexation treaty of 1897." ''Diplomatic History'' 6.1 (1982): 23–44.</ref> Similarly, Germany was the alternative to American takeover of the Philippines in 1900, and Tokyo strongly preferred the U.S. to take over. AS the U.S. became a naval world power, it needed to find a way to avoid a military confrontation in the Pacific with Japan.<ref>James K. Eyre Jr, "Japan and the American Annexation of the Philippines." ''Pacific Historical Review'' 11.1 (1942): 55–71 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3632998 online].</ref>

In the 1890s, Roosevelt had been an ardent [[American imperialism|imperialist]] and vigorously defended the permanent acquisition of the Philippines in the 1900 campaign. After the [[Philippine–American War|local insurrection]] ended in 1902, he largely lost his imperialist interest in the Philippines and Asian expansion but wished to have a strong U.S. presence in the region as a symbol of democratic values. One of Theodore Roosevelt's priorities during his presidency and afterwards, was the maintenance of friendly relations with Japan.<ref>Michael J. Green, ''By More Than Providence: Grand Strategy and American Power in the Asia Pacific Since 1783'' (2019) pp. 78–113.</ref><ref>Charles E. Neu, ''An Uncertain Friendship: Theodore Roosevelt and Japan, 1906–1909'' (1967) pp. 310–319.</ref> From 1904 to 1905 [[Russo-Japanese War|Japan and Russia were at war.]] Roosevelt admired the martial courage of the Japanese, and distrusted the reckless German Kaiser. Both sides asked Roosevelt to mediate a peace conference, held successfully in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]]. Roosevelt won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his efforts.

In California, [[Anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States|anti-Japanese hostility was growing]], and Tokyo protested. Roosevelt [[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907|negotiated a "Gentleman's Agreement" in 1907]]. Explicit discrimination against the Japanese was ended, and Japan agreed not to allow unskilled immigrants into the United States.<ref>Neu, pp. 263–280</ref> The [[Great White Fleet]] of American battleships visited Japan in 1908.  Pulitzer prize-winning biographer [[Henry Pringle]] states that the great voyage was "the direct result of the Japanese trouble."<ref>Henry Pringle ''Theodore Roosevelt'' (1956) p. 288;</ref> Roosevelt intended to emphasize the superiority of the American fleet over the smaller Japanese navy, but instead of resentment the visitors arrived to a joyous welcome by Japanese elitea as well as the general public.  This good-will facilitated the [[Root–Takahira Agreement]] of November 1908 which reaffirmed the status quo of Japanese control of Korea and American control of the Philippines.<ref>Thomas A. Bailey, "The Root-Takahira Agreement of 1908." Pacific historical review 9.1 (1940): 19-35. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3634124 online]</ref>
{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=614–616}}

====Europe====
Success in the war against Spain and the new empire, plus having the largest economy in the world, meant that the United States had emerged as a world power.<ref>Walter LaFeber, "The 'Lion in the Path': The US Emergence as a World Power." ''Political Science Quarterly'' 101.5 (1986): 705-718 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2150973 online].</ref> Roosevelt searched for ways to win recognition for the position abroad.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=382–383}}

Roosevelt also played a major role in mediating the [[First Moroccan Crisis]] by calling the [[Algeciras Conference]], which averted war between France and Germany.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=450–451}}

Roosevelt's presidency saw the strengthening of ties with Great Britain. [[The Great Rapprochement]] had begun with British support of the United States during the Spanish–American War, and it continued as Britain withdrew its fleet from the Caribbean in favor of focusing on the rising [[Anglo-German naval arms race|German naval threat]].{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=387–388}} In 1901, Britain and the United States signed the [[Hay–Pauncefote Treaty]], abrogating the [[Clayton–Bulwer Treaty]], which had prevented the United States from constructing a canal connecting the Pacific and the Atlantic Ocean.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=399–400}} The long-standing [[Alaska boundary dispute]] was settled on terms favorable to the United States, as Great Britain was unwilling to alienate the United States over what it considered to be a secondary issue. As Roosevelt later put it, the resolution of the Alaskan boundary dispute "settled the last serious trouble between the British Empire and ourselves."{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=397–398}}

====Latin America and Panama Canal====
As president, he primarily focused the nation's overseas ambitions on the Caribbean, especially locations that had a bearing on the defense of his pet project, the [[Panama Canal]].{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=615–616}} Roosevelt also increased the size of the navy, and by the end of his second term the United States had more battleships than any other country besides Britain. The Panama Canal when it opened in 1914 allowed the U.S. Navy to rapidly move back and forth from the Pacific to the Caribbean to European waters.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=384}}

In December 1902, the Germans, British, and Italians blockaded the ports of [[Venezuela]] in order to force the repayment of delinquent loans. Roosevelt was particularly concerned with the motives of German Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]]. He succeeded in getting the three nations to agree to arbitration by tribunal at [[The Hague]], and successfully defused the [[Venezuela Crisis of 1902–1903|crisis]].{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=464}} The latitude granted to the Europeans by the arbiters was in part responsible for the "[[Roosevelt Corollary]]" to the [[Monroe Doctrine]], which the President issued in 1904: "Chronic wrongdoing or an impotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society, may in America, as elsewhere, ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation, and in the Western Hemisphere, the adherence of the United States to the Monroe doctrine may force the United States, however reluctantly, in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence, to the exercise of an international police power."{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=527}}

[[File:Panama canal cartooon 1903.jpg|thumb|left|The U.S.'s intentions to influence the area (especially the [[Panama Canal]] construction and control) led to the [[separation of Panama from Colombia]] in 1903]]
The pursuit of an [[History of the Panama Canal|isthmus canal]] in Central America during this period focused on two possible routes—[[Nicaragua]] and Panama, which was then a rebellious district within [[Colombia]]. Roosevelt convinced Congress to approve the Panamanian alternative, and a treaty was approved, only to be rejected by the Colombian government. When the Panamanians learned of this, a rebellion followed, was supported by Roosevelt, and succeeded. A [[Hay–Bunau-Varilla Treaty|treaty]] with the new Panama government for construction of the canal was then reached in 1903.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=482–486}} Roosevelt received criticism for paying the bankrupt Panama Canal Company and the New Panama Canal Company $40,000,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|.4|1903|r=2}}&nbsp;billion in {{Inflation-year|US}}) for the rights and equipment to build the canal.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|p=209}} Critics charged that an American investor syndicate allegedly divided the large payment among themselves. There was also controversy over whether a French company engineer influenced Roosevelt in choosing the Panama route for the canal over the Nicaragua route. Roosevelt denied charges of corruption concerning the canal in a January 8, 1906 message to Congress. In January 1909, Roosevelt, in an unprecedented move, brought criminal libel charges against the New York ''World'' and the Indianapolis ''News'' known as the "Roosevelt-Panama Libel Cases".{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|pp=209–210}} Both cases were dismissed by U.S. District Courts, and on January 3, 1911, the U.S. Supreme Court, upon federal appeal, upheld the lower courts' rulings.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|pp=213–214}} Historians are sharply critical of Roosevelt's criminal prosecutions of the ''World'' and the ''News'', but are divided on whether actual corruption in acquiring and building the Panama Canal took place.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|p=215}}

In 1906, following a disputed election, an insurrection ensued in Cuba; Roosevelt sent Taft, the Secretary of War, to monitor the situation; he was convinced that he had the authority to unilaterally authorize Taft to deploy Marines if necessary, without congressional approval.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=570}}

Examining the work of numerous scholars, Ricard (2014) reports that:

<blockquote>The most striking evolution in the twenty-first-century historiography of Theodore Roosevelt is the switch from a partial arraignment of the imperialist to a quasi-unanimous celebration of the master diplomatist.... [Hagiographies of Roosevelt] have underlined cogently Roosevelt's exceptional statesmanship in the construction of the nascent twentieth-century "special relationship". ...The twenty-sixth president's reputation as a brilliant diplomatist and realpolitician has undeniably reached new heights in the twenty-first century...yet, his Philippine policy still prompts criticism.<ref>Serge Ricard, "The State of Theodore Roosevelt Studies" [http://h-diplo.org/essays/PDF/E116.pdf "H-Diplo Essay #116", October 24, 2014]</ref></blockquote>

Building on McKinley's effective use of the press, Roosevelt made the White House the center of news every day, providing interviews and photo opportunities. After noticing the reporters huddled outside the White House in the rain one day, he gave them their own room inside, effectively inventing the presidential press briefing. The grateful press, with unprecedented access to the White House, rewarded Roosevelt with ample coverage.<ref name="american chronicle">{{Cite news|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/6883 |publisher=American Chronicle |date=March 15, 2006 |title=Happy Anniversary to the first scheduled presidential press conference—93 years young! |first=Robert |last=Rouse |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913094418/http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/6883 |archive-date=September 13, 2008}}</ref>

Roosevelt normally enjoyed very close relationships with the press, which he used to keep in daily contact with his middle-class base. While out of office, he made a living as a writer and magazine editor. He loved talking with intellectuals, authors, and writers. He drew the line, however, at exposé-oriented scandal-mongering journalists who, during his term, sent magazine subscriptions soaring by their attacks on corrupt politicians, mayors, and corporations. Roosevelt himself was not usually a target, but a speech of his from 1906 coined the term "[[muckraker]]" for unscrupulous journalists making wild charges. "The liar", he said, "is no whit better than the thief, and if his mendacity takes the form of slander he may be worse than most thieves."<ref>{{cite book | first1=Arthur | last1 = Weinberg| first2=Lila Shaffer | last2 = Weinberg|title=The Muckrakers|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HXMFrIZ68gwC&pg=PA59 |year=1961|publisher= University of Illinois Press | pages = 58–66| isbn = 978-0-252-06986-4}}</ref>

The press did briefly target Roosevelt in one instance. After 1904, he was periodically criticized for the manner in which he facilitated the construction of the [[Panama Canal]]. According to biographer Brands, Roosevelt, near the end of his term, demanded that the Justice Department bring charges of criminal libel against Joseph Pulitzer's ''New York World''. The publication had accused him of "deliberate misstatements of fact" in defense of family members who were criticized as a result of the Panama affair. Though an indictment was obtained, the case was ultimately dismissed in federal court—it was not a federal offense, but one enforceable in state courts. The Justice Department had predicted that result, and had also advised Roosevelt accordingly.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=633–634}}

===Election of 1904===
{{Main |1904 United States presidential election}}
[[File:ElectoralCollege1904.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.35|1904 election results]]

The control and management of the Republican Party lay in the hands of Ohio Senator and Republican Party chairman Mark Hanna until McKinley's death. Roosevelt and Hanna frequently cooperated during Roosevelt's first term, but Hanna left open the possibility of a challenge to Roosevelt for the 1904 Republican nomination. Roosevelt and Ohio's other Senator, [[Joseph B. Foraker]], forced Hanna's hand by calling for Ohio's state Republican convention to endorse Roosevelt for the 1904 nomination.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=436–437}} Unwilling to break with the president, Hanna was forced to publicly endorse Roosevelt. Hanna and Pennsylvania Senator Matthew Quay both died in early 1904, and with the waning of Thomas Platt's power, Roosevelt faced little effective opposition for the 1904 nomination.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=437–438}} In deference to Hanna's conservative loyalists, Roosevelt at first offered the party chairmanship to [[Cornelius Bliss]], but he declined. Roosevelt turned to his own man, [[George B. Cortelyou]] of New York, the first Secretary of Commerce and Labor. To buttress his hold on the party's nomination, Roosevelt made it clear that anyone opposing Cortelyou would be considered to be opposing the President.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=501–503}} The President secured his own nomination, but his preferred vice-presidential running mate, [[Robert R. Hitt]], was not nominated.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=504}} Senator [[Charles W. Fairbanks|Charles Warren Fairbanks]] of Indiana, a favorite of conservatives, gained the nomination.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=437–438}}

While Roosevelt followed the tradition of incumbents in not actively campaigning on the stump, he sought to control the campaign's message through specific instructions to Cortelyou. He also attempted to manage the press's release of White House statements by forming the Ananias Club. Any journalist who repeated a statement made by the president without approval was penalized by restriction of further access.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=507}}

The Democratic Party's nominee in 1904 was [[Alton B. Parker|Alton Brooks Parker]]. Democratic newspapers charged that Republicans were extorting large campaign contributions from corporations, putting ultimate responsibility on Roosevelt, himself.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|pp=215–216}} Roosevelt denied corruption while at the same time he ordered Cortelyou to return $100,000 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|.1|1904|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}) of a campaign contribution from Standard Oil.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|p=216}} Parker said that Roosevelt was accepting corporate donations to keep damaging information from the Bureau of Corporations from going public.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|p=216}} Roosevelt strongly denied Parker's charge and responded that he would "go into the Presidency unhampered by any pledge, promise, or understanding of any kind, sort, or description...".{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|pp=216–217}} Allegations from Parker and the Democrats, however, had little impact on the election, as Roosevelt promised to give every American a "[[Square Deal|square deal]]".{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|pp=216–217}} Roosevelt won 56% of the popular vote, and Parker received 38%; Roosevelt also won the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] vote, 336 to 140. Before his inauguration ceremony, Roosevelt declared that he would not serve another term.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=513–514}} Democrats afterwards would continue to charge Roosevelt and the Republicans of being influenced by corporate donations during Roosevelt's second term.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|pp=217–218}}

===Second term===
[[File:Review of reviews and world's work (1890) (14597436840).jpg|thumb|right|Roosevelt family at Oyster Bay, circa 1903]]
As his second term progressed, Roosevelt moved to the left of his Republican Party base and called for a series of reforms, most of which Congress failed to pass.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lewis L. Gould|title=Theodore Roosevelt|url=https://archive.org/details/theodoreroosevel00goul|url-access=registration|year=2012|publisher=Oxford UP|page=[https://archive.org/details/theodoreroosevel00goul/page/2 2]|isbn=978-0-19-979701-1}}</ref> In his last year in office, he was assisted by his friend [[Archibald Butt]] (who later perished in the sinking of [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']]).<ref name="Obit">{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1912/04/16/100530255.pdf |title=Major Archibald Butt |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 16, 1912 |access-date= June 2, 2018 }}</ref> Roosevelt's influence waned as he approached the end of his second term, as his promise to forego a third term made him a [[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] and his concentration of power provoked a backlash from many Congressmen.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=463–464}} He sought a national [[Incorporation (business)|incorporation]] law (at a time when all corporations had state charters), called for a federal [[Income tax in the United States|income tax]] (despite the Supreme Court's ruling in ''[[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co.]]''), and an [[Estate tax in the United States|inheritance tax]]. In the area of labor legislation, Roosevelt called for limits on the use of court injunctions against labor unions during strikes; injunctions were a powerful weapon that mostly helped business. He wanted an employee liability law for industrial injuries (pre-empting state laws) and an [[Eight-hour day|eight-hour work day]] for federal employees. In other areas he also sought a [[postal savings system]] (to provide competition for local banks), and he asked for campaign reform laws.<ref>Ricard, ed. ''A companion to Theodore Roosevelt'' (2011) pp. 160–166.</ref>

The election of 1904 continued to be a source of contention between Republicans and Democrats. A Congressional investigation in 1905 revealed that corporate executives donated tens of thousands of dollars in 1904 to the Republican National Committee. In 1908, a month before the general presidential election, Governor [[Charles N. Haskell]] of Oklahoma, former Democratic Treasurer, said that Senators beholden to Standard Oil lobbied Roosevelt, in the summer of 1904, to authorize the leasing of Indian oil lands by Standard Oil subsidiaries. He said Roosevelt overruled his Secretary of Interior [[Ethan A. Hitchcock (Interior)|Ethan A. Hitchcock]] and granted a pipeline franchise to run through the [[Osage Nation|Osage lands]] to the Prairie Oil and Gas Company. The New York ''Sun'' made a similar accusation and said that Standard Oil, a refinery who financially benefited from the pipeline, had contributed $150,000 to the Republicans in 1904 (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|.15|1904|r=1}}&nbsp;million in {{Inflation-year|US}}) after Roosevelt's alleged reversal allowing the pipeline franchise. Roosevelt branded Haskell's allegation as "a lie, pure and simple" and obtained a denial from Treasury Secretary [[L. M. Shaw|Shaw]] that Roosevelt had neither coerced Shaw nor overruled him.{{Sfn|Chambers|1974|p=219}}

==Post-presidency (1909–1914)==
===Election of 1908===
{{Main|1908 United States presidential election}}
[[File:TR smiling in automobile.tif|thumb|Roosevelt shortly after leaving office, October 1910]]

Roosevelt enjoyed being president and was still relatively youthful, but felt that a limited number of terms provided a check against dictatorship. Roosevelt ultimately decided to stick to his 1904 pledge not to run for a third term. He personally favored Secretary of State [[Elihu Root]] as his successor, but Root's ill health made him an unsuitable candidate. New York Governor [[Charles Evans Hughes]] loomed as a potentially strong candidate and shared Roosevelt's progressivism, but Roosevelt disliked him and considered him to be too independent. Instead, Roosevelt settled on his Secretary of War, William Howard Taft, who had ably served under Presidents Harrison, McKinley, and Roosevelt in various positions. Roosevelt and Taft had been friends since 1890, and Taft had consistently supported President Roosevelt's policies.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=483–485}} Roosevelt was determined to install the successor of his choice, and wrote the following to Taft: "Dear Will: Do you want any action about those federal officials? I will break their necks with the utmost cheerfulness if you say the word!". Just weeks later he branded as "false and malicious" the charge that he was using the offices at his disposal to favor Taft.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=626}} At the 1908 Republican convention, many chanted for "four years more" of a Roosevelt presidency, but Taft won the nomination after Henry Cabot Lodge made it clear that Roosevelt was not interested in a third term.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=488–489}}

In the [[1908 United States presidential election|1908 election]], Taft easily defeated the Democratic nominee, three-time candidate [[William Jennings Bryan]]. Taft promoted a progressivism that stressed the rule of law; he preferred that judges rather than administrators or politicians make the basic decisions about fairness. Taft usually proved to be a less adroit politician than Roosevelt and lacked the energy and personal magnetism, along with the publicity devices, the dedicated supporters, and the broad base of public support that made Roosevelt so formidable. When Roosevelt realized that lowering the tariff would risk creating severe tensions inside the Republican Party by pitting producers (manufacturers and farmers) against merchants and consumers, he stopped talking about the issue. Taft ignored the risks and tackled the tariff boldly, encouraging reformers to fight for lower rates, and then cutting deals with conservative leaders that kept overall rates high. The resulting [[Payne-Aldrich tariff]] of 1909, signed into law early in President Taft's tenure, was too high for most reformers, and Taft's handling of the tariff alienated all sides. While the crisis was building inside the Party, Roosevelt was touring Africa and Europe, to allow Taft to be his own man.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor= 1902605 |title= William Howard Taft and the Payne-Aldrich Tariff |journal= The Mississippi Valley Historical Review|volume= 50 |issue= 3 |pages= 424–442 |last1= Solvick |first1= Stanley D. |year= 1963 |doi= 10.2307/1902605}}</ref>

===Africa and Europe (1909–1910)===
[[File:Roosevelt safari elephant.jpg|thumb|left|Roosevelt standing next to the elephant he shot on safari]]

In March 1909, shortly after the end of his presidency, Roosevelt left New York for the [[Smithsonian-Roosevelt African Expedition]], a [[safari]] in [[East Africa|east]] and [[central Africa]].<ref name="Science1908">{{cite journal|journal=Science|date= December 18, 1908 | volume = 28 | issue = 729|pages=876–877|jstor=1635075|doi= 10.1126/science.28.729.876| title= President Roosevelt's African Trip | pmid = 17743798|bibcode= 1908Sci....28..876. }}</ref> Roosevelt's party landed in [[Mombasa]], [[British East Africa|East Africa]] (now [[Kenya]]) and traveled to the [[Belgian Congo]] (now [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) before following the [[Nile]] to [[Khartoum]] in modern [[Sudan]].

Roosevelt and his companions killed or trapped approximately 11,400 animals,<ref name="SIA" /> from insects and moles to hippopotamuses and elephants. The 1,000 large animals included 512 [[Big-game hunting|big game]] animals, including six rare [[White rhinoceros|white rhinos]]. Tons of salted animals and their skins were shipped to Washington; it took years to mount them all, and the Smithsonian shared many duplicate specimens with other museums. Regarding the large number of animals taken, Roosevelt said, "I can be condemned only if the existence of the [[National Museum of Natural History|National Museum]], the [[American Museum of Natural History]], and all similar zoological institutions are to be condemned".{{Sfn|O'Toole|2005|p=67}} He wrote a detailed account of the safari in the book ''African Game Trails'', recounting the excitement of the chase, the people he met, and the flora and fauna he collected in the name of science.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/africangametrail01roos |title=African Game Trails | first =Theodore |last=Roosevelt |year=1910|publisher=New York, C. Scribner's sons }}</ref>

After his safari, Roosevelt traveled north to embark on a tour of Europe. Stopping first in Egypt, he commented favorably on British rule of the region, giving his opinion that Egypt was not yet ready for independence.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=505}} He refused a meeting with the [[Pope Pius X|Pope]] due to a dispute over a group of Methodists active in Rome, but met with Emperor [[Franz Joseph]] of [[Austria-Hungary]], Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany, King [[George V]] of Great Britain, and other European leaders. In [[Oslo, Norway]], Roosevelt delivered a speech calling for limitations on naval armaments, a strengthening of the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]], and the creation of a "League of Peace" among the world powers.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=505–509}} He also delivered the [[Romanes Lecture]] at [[Oxford]], in which he denounced those who sought parallels between the evolution of animal life and the development of society.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=511}} Though Roosevelt attempted to avoid domestic politics during his time abroad, he met with [[Gifford Pinchot]], who related his own disappointment with the Taft Administration.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=506–507}} Pinchot had been forced to resign as head of the forest service after clashing with Taft's Interior Secretary, [[Richard Ballinger]], who had prioritized development over conservation.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=503}} Roosevelt returned to the United States in June 1910.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=511}}

===Republican Party schism===
[[File:For Auld Lang Syne - Leonard Raven-Hill.jpg|thumb|''Punch'' depicts no-holds-barred fight between Taft and Roosevelt]]

Roosevelt had attempted to refashion Taft into a second version of himself, but as soon as Taft began to display his individuality, the former president expressed his disenchantment. He was offended on election night when Taft indicated that his success had been possible not just through the efforts of Roosevelt, but also his brother [[Charles Phelps Taft|Charley]]. Roosevelt was further alienated when Taft, intent on becoming his own man, did not consult him about cabinet appointments.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|pp=665–666}} Roosevelt and other progressives were ideologically dissatisfied over Taft's conservation policies and his handling of the tariff when he concentrated more power in the hands of conservative party leaders in Congress.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=502–503}} Regarding radicalism and liberalism, Roosevelt wrote a British friend in 1911:
:Fundamentally it is the radical liberal with whom I sympathize. He is at least working toward the end for which I think we should all of us strive; and when he adds sanity in moderation to courage and enthusiasm for high ideals he develops into the kind of statesman whom alone I can wholeheartedly support."<ref>letter to [[George Otto Trevelyan]], October 1, 1911, [https://web.archive.org/web/20161206040012/http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/site/c.elKSIdOWIiJ8H/b.9294915/k.C9B7/Index_R.htm in Albert Bushnell Hart, ed., '' Theodore Roosevelt Cyclopedia'' (1941) p. 499.]</ref>

Roosevelt urged progressives to take control of the Republican Party at the state and local level and to avoid splitting the party in a way that would hand the presidency to the Democrats in 1912. Additionally, Roosevelt expressed optimism about the Taft Administration after meeting with the president in the White House in June 1910.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=512–513}}

In August 1910, Roosevelt gained national attention with a speech at [[Osawatomie, Kansas]], which was the most radical of his career and marked his public break with Taft and the conservative Republicans. Advocating a program of "[[New Nationalism (Theodore Roosevelt)|New Nationalism]]", Roosevelt emphasized the priority of labor over capital interests, a need to more effectively control corporate creation and combination, and proposed a ban on corporate political contributions.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=675}} Returning to New York, Roosevelt began a battle to take control of the state Republican party from [[William Barnes Jr.]], Tom Platt's successor as the state party boss, whom he would later confront in the [[Barnes vs. Roosevelt Libel Trial]]. Taft had pledged his support to Roosevelt in this endeavor, and Roosevelt was outraged when Taft's support failed to materialize at the 1910 state convention.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=515–516}} Roosevelt nonetheless campaigned for the Republicans in the [[1910 United States elections|1910 elections]], in which the Democrats gained control of the House for the first time since the 1890s. Among the newly elected Democrats was New York state senator [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], who argued that he represented his distant cousin's policies better than his Republican opponent.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=517}}

The Republican progressives interpreted the 1910 defeats as a compelling argument for the complete reorganization of the party in 1911.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=683}} Senator [[Robert M. La Follette]] of Wisconsin joined with Pinchot, William White, and California Governor [[Hiram Johnson]] to create the National Progressive Republican League; their objectives were to defeat the power of political bossism at the state level and to replace Taft at the national level.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=518}} Despite skepticism of La Follette's new league, Roosevelt expressed general support for progressive principles. Between January and April 1911, Roosevelt wrote a series of articles for ''The Outlook,'' defending what he called "the great movement of our day, the progressive nationalist movement against special privilege, and in favor of an honest and efficient political and [[industrial democracy]]".{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=684}} With Roosevelt apparently uninterested in running in 1912, La Follette declared his own candidacy in June 1911.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=518}} Roosevelt continually criticized Taft after the 1910 elections, and the break between the two men became final after the Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against US Steel in September 1911; Roosevelt was humiliated by this suit because he had personally approved of an acquisition that the Justice Department was now challenging. However, Roosevelt was still unwilling to run against Taft in 1912; he instead hoped to run in 1916 against whichever Democrat beat Taft in 1912.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=519}}

====Dispute over arbitration treaties====
Taft was a major advocate of arbitration as a major reform of the [[Progressive Era]]. In 1911 Taft and his Secretary of State [[Philander C. Knox]] negotiated major treaties with Great Britain and with France providing that differences be arbitrated. Disputes had to be submitted to the Hague Court or other tribunal. These were signed in August 1911 but had to be ratified by a two-thirds vote of the Senate. Neither Taft nor Knox consulted with members of the Senate during the negotiating process. By then many Republicans were opposed to Taft, and the president felt that lobbying too hard for the treaties might cause their defeat. He made some speeches supporting the treaties in October, but the Senate added amendments Taft could not accept, killing the agreements.<ref>[[David H. Burton]], ''William Howard Taft: Confident Peacemaker'' (2004) pp. 82–83.</ref>

The arbitration issue opens a window on a bitter philosophical dispute among American progressives. Some, led by Taft looked to legal arbitration as the best alternative to warfare. Taft was a constitutional lawyer who later became Chief Justice; he had a deep understanding of the legal issues.<ref>John E. Noyes, "William Howard Taft and the Taft Arbitration Treaties." ''Villanova Law Review'' 56 (2011): 535+ [https://digitalcommons.law.villanova.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1017&context=vlr online].</ref> Taft's political base was the conservative business community that largely supported peace movements before 1914. However, his mistake, in this case, was a failure to mobilize that base. The businessmen believed that economic rivalries were the cause of war, and that extensive trade led to an interdependent world that would make war a very expensive and useless anachronism.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1894200|title = Taft, Roosevelt, and the Arbitration Treaties of 1911|journal = The Journal of American History|volume = 53|issue = 2|pages = 279–298|last1 = Campbell|first1 = John P.|year = 1966|doi = 10.2307/1894200}}</ref>

However, an opposing faction of progressives, led by Roosevelt, ridiculed arbitration as foolhardy idealism, and insisted on the realism of warfare as the only solution to serious international disputes. Roosevelt worked with his close friend Senator Henry Cabot Lodge to impose those amendments that ruined the goals of the treaties. Lodge thought the treaties impinged too much on senatorial prerogatives.<ref>Robert J. Fischer, "Henry Cabot Lodge and the Taft Arbitration Treaties." ''South Atlantic Quarterly'' 78 (Spring 1979): 244–58.</ref> Roosevelt, however, was acting to sabotage Taft's campaign promises.<ref>E. James Hindman, "The General Arbitration Treaties of William Howard Taft." ''Historian'' 36.1 (1973): 52–65. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24443896 online]</ref> At a deeper level, Roosevelt's truly believed that arbitration was a naïve solution and the great issues had to be decided by warfare. The Rooseveltian approach incorporated a near-mystical faith of the ennobling nature of war. It endorsed jingoistic nationalism as opposed to the businessmen's calculation of profit and national interest.<ref>{{cite book|author=Melvin I.

===Election of 1912===
{{Main|1912 United States presidential election|Progressive Party (United States, 1912)}}

====Republican primaries and convention====
[[File:Roosevelt on the Stump, 1912.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Roosevelt campaigning for president, 1912]]

In November 1911, a group of Ohio Republicans endorsed Roosevelt for the party's nomination for president; the endorsers included James R. Garfield and Dan Hanna. This endorsement was made by leaders of President Taft's home state. Roosevelt conspicuously declined to make a statement—requested by Garfield—that he would flatly refuse a nomination. Soon thereafter, Roosevelt said, "I am really sorry for Taft... I am sure he means well, but he means well feebly, and he does not know how! He is utterly unfit for leadership and this is a time when we need leadership." In January 1912, Roosevelt declared "if the people make a draft on me I shall not decline to serve".{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=698}} Later that year, Roosevelt spoke before the Constitutional Convention in Ohio, openly identifying as a progressive and endorsing progressive reforms—even endorsing popular review of state judicial decisions.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=703}} In reaction to Roosevelt's proposals for popular overrule of court decisions, Taft said, "Such extremists are not progressives—they are political emotionalists or neurotics".{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=709}}

Roosevelt began to envision himself as the savior of the Republican Party from defeat in the upcoming presidential election. In February 1912, Roosevelt announced in Boston, "I will accept the nomination for president if it is tendered to me. I hope that so far as possible the people may be given the chance through direct primaries to express who shall be the nominee.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=705}}<ref name="gloriousr">{{cite book | title = The Glorious Burden: The American Presidency | url = https://archive.org/details/gloriousburden00lora | url-access = registration | last=Lorant |first= Stefan |year= 1968 |page= [https://archive.org/details/gloriousburden00lora/page/512 512] | place =New York | publisher = Harper & Row | isbn = 0-06-012686-8}}</ref> Elihu Root and Henry Cabot Lodge thought that division of the party would lead to its defeat in the next election, while Taft believed that he would be defeated either in the Republican primary or in the general election.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=706}}

Meanwhile, Roosevelt won in Illinois, Minnesota, Nebraska, South Dakota, California, Maryland and Pennsylvania; Roosevelt also won Taft's home state of Ohio. These primary elections, while demonstrating Roosevelt's continuing popularity with the electorate, were not pivotal. The final credentials of the state delegates at the national convention were determined by the national committee, which was controlled by the party leaders, headed by the incumbent president.

Prior to the [[1912 Republican National Convention]] in Chicago, Roosevelt expressed doubt about his prospects for victory, noting that Taft had more delegates and control of the credentials committee. His only hope was to convince party leaders that the nomination of Taft would hand the election to the Democrats, but party leaders were determined not to cede their leadership to Roosevelt.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=524}} The credentials committee awarded almost all contested delegates to Taft, and Taft won the nomination on the first ballot.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=524–526}} Black delegates from the South played a key role: they voted heavily for Taft and put him over the top.<ref>{{cite book|author=Omar H.

Once his defeat at the Republican convention appeared probable, Roosevelt announced that he would "accept the progressive nomination on a progressive platform and I shall fight to the end, win or lose". At the same time, Roosevelt prophetically said, "My feeling is that the Democrats will probably win if they nominate a progressive".{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=717}} Bolting from the Republican Party, Roosevelt and key allies such as Pinchot and his wife, [[Cornelia Bryce Pinchot]], who was a longtime friend of Roosevelt's,<ref>"[https://www.nytimes.com/1914/08/16/archives/gifford-pinchot-weds-miss-bryce-progressive-senatorial-nominee.html Gifford Pinchot Weds Miss Bryce—Progressive Senatorial Nominee Marries Daughter of Gen. and Mrs. Lloyd S.

California Governor Hiram Johnson was nominated as Roosevelt's running mate. Roosevelt's platform echoed his 1907–1908 proposals, calling for vigorous government intervention to protect the people from the selfish interests:

Though many Progressive party supporters in the North were supporters of civil rights for blacks, Roosevelt did not give strong support to civil rights and ran a "[[Lily-white movement|lily-white]]" campaign in the South.

As an experienced hunter and anatomist, Roosevelt correctly concluded that since he was not coughing blood, the bullet had not reached his lung.

Subsequent probes and an x-ray showed that the bullet had lodged in Roosevelt's chest muscle, but did not penetrate the [[pleura]]. Doctors concluded that it would be less dangerous to leave it in place than to attempt to remove it, and Roosevelt carried the bullet with him for the rest of his life.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/life/timeline.htm |title=Roosevelt Timeline |publisher=Theodore Roosevelt | access-date =September 14, 2010}}</ref><ref>Gerard Helferich, ''Theodore Roosevelt and the Assassin: Madness, Vengeance, and the Campaign of 1912'' (2013)</ref> Both Taft and Democratic nominee Woodrow Wilson suspended their own campaigning until Roosevelt recovered and resumed his.

He spent two weeks recuperating before returning to the campaign trail. He later wrote a friend about the bullet inside him, "I do not mind it any more than if it were in my waistcoat pocket."<ref>''The Works of Theodore Roosevelt'' (1926) – Volume 24 – Page 405.</ref>

====Farewell manifesto====
On October 20, Roosevelt spoke to a crowd of 16,000 at Madison Square Garden. The speech included: "Perhaps once in a generation, there comes a chance for the people of a country to play their part wisely and fearlessly in some great battle of the age-long warfare for human rights."<ref>{{cite AV media |first=Doris Kearns |last=Goodwin |title=[[The Bully Pulpit (book)|The Bully Pulpit]] |medium=Audiobook |asin=B00DEKZDOG |year=2013 |publisher=Simon & Schuster Audio |chapter=Armageddon }}</ref>

====Election results====
After the Democrats nominated Governor [[Woodrow Wilson]] of New Jersey, Roosevelt did not expect to win the general election, as Wilson had compiled a record attractive to many progressive Democrats who might have otherwise considered voting for Roosevelt.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=529}} Roosevelt still campaigned vigorously, and the election developed into a two-person contest between Wilson and Roosevelt despite Taft's presence in the race. Roosevelt respected Wilson, but the two differed on various issues; Wilson opposed any federal intervention regarding women's suffrage or child labor (he viewed these as state issues), and attacked Roosevelt's tolerance of large businesses.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=529–530}}

Roosevelt won 4.1&nbsp;million votes (27%), compared to Taft's 3.5&nbsp;million (23%). Wilson gained 6.3&nbsp;million votes (42% of the total) and a massive landslide in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], with 435 electoral votes; Roosevelt won 88 electoral votes, while Taft won 8. Pennsylvania was the only eastern state won by Roosevelt; in the Midwest, he carried Michigan, Minnesota, and South Dakota; in the West, California, and Washington.<ref>Lewis L.

===1913–1914 South American expedition===
{{Main|Roosevelt–Rondon Scientific Expedition}}
A friend of Roosevelt's, Father [[John Augustine Zahm]], persuaded Roosevelt to participate in an expedition to South America. To finance the expedition, Roosevelt received support from the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in return for promising to bring back many new animal specimens. Roosevelt's popular book, ''Through the Brazilian Wilderness''<ref>{{Citation | last = Roosevelt | first = Theodore | author-link = Theodore Roosevelt | title = Through the Brazilian Wilderness | url = http://www.s4ulanguages.com/theodore.html | publisher = S4u languages | format = facsimile | edition = 1st | year = 1914| hdl = 2027/nyp.33433081694915 | hdl-access = free }}.</ref> describes his expedition into the Brazilian jungle in 1913 as a member of the [[Roosevelt-Rondon Scientific Expedition]], co-named after its leader, Brazilian explorer [[Cândido Rondon]].

Once in South America, a new, far more ambitious goal was added: to find the headwaters of the Rio da Duvida (Portuguese for "River of Doubt"), and trace it north to the Madeira and thence to the [[Amazon River]]. It was later renamed [[Roosevelt River]] in honor of the former president. Roosevelt's crew consisted of his son [[Kermit Roosevelt|Kermit]], Colonel Rondon, naturalist [[George Kruck Cherrie]] (sent by the American Museum of Natural History), Brazilian Lieutenant João Lira, team physician Dr. José Antonio Cajazeira, and 16 skilled paddlers and porters. Roosevelt also identified Leo Miller (another AMNH recommendation), [[Anthony Fiala]], Frank Harper, and Jacob Sigg as crew members.<ref>{{Cite wikisource |title=Through the Brazilian Wilderness |last=Roosevelt |first=Theodore |year=1914 |chapter=The Start }}</ref> The initial expedition started somewhat tenuously on December 9, 1913, at the height of the rainy season. The trip down the River of Doubt started on February 27, 1914.<ref name="Millard, 2009"/>{{page needed|date=September 2021}}

During the trip down the river, Roosevelt suffered a minor leg wound after he jumped into the river to try to prevent two canoes from smashing against the rocks. The flesh wound he received, however, soon gave him [[tropical fever]] that resembled the [[malaria]] he had contracted while in Cuba fifteen years before.<ref name="oimjjac">{{Citation | first = Rudolph | last = Marx | title = The Health of The President: Theodore Roosevelt | publisher = Health guidance | date = October 31, 2011}}.</ref> Because the bullet lodged in his chest from the assassination attempt in 1912 was never removed, his health worsened from the infection.<ref name="DeathNews"/> This weakened Roosevelt so greatly that six weeks into the adventure, he had to be attended to day and night by the expedition's physician and his son Kermit. By then, he could not walk because of the infection in his injured leg and an infirmity in the other, which was due to a traffic accident a decade earlier. Roosevelt was riddled with chest pains, fighting a fever that soared to {{convert|103|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and at times made him delirious, at one point constantly reciting the first two lines of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s poem "[[Kubla Khan]]": "In Xanadu did Kubla Khan / A stately pleasure dome decree". Regarding his condition as a threat to the survival of the others, Roosevelt insisted he be left behind to allow the poorly provisioned expedition to proceed as rapidly as it could, preparing to commit suicide with an overdose of [[morphine]]. Only an appeal by his son persuaded him to continue.<ref name="Millard, 2009">Millard, ''The river of doubt: Theodore Roosevelt's darkest journey'' (2009).{{page needed|date=September 2021}}</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2021}}

Despite Roosevelt's continued decline and loss of over {{convert|50|lb|kg}}, Colonel Rondon reduced the pace of the expedition to allow for his commission's mapmaking and other geographical tasks, which required regular stops to fix the expedition's position by sun-based survey. Upon Roosevelt's return to New York, friends and family were startled by his physical appearance and fatigue. Roosevelt wrote, perhaps prophetically, to a friend that the trip had cut his life short by ten years. For the rest of his few remaining years, he would be plagued by flare-ups of malaria and leg inflammations so severe as to require surgery.{{Sfn|Thayer|1919|pp=4–7}} Before Roosevelt had even completed his sea voyage home, critics raised doubts over his claims of exploring and navigating a completely uncharted river over {{convert|625|mi|km}} long. When he had recovered sufficiently, he addressed a standing-room-only convention organized in Washington, D.C., by the [[National Geographic Society]] and satisfactorily defended his claims.<ref name="Millard, 2009"/>{{page needed|date=September 2021}}

{{See also|Roosevelt's World War I volunteers}}
[[File:1914 - Theodore Roosevelt on balcony of Hotel Allen.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|right|Former President Theodore Roosevelt in Allentown, Pennsylvania, 1914]]

Roosevelt returned to the United States in May 1914. Though he was outraged by the [[Presidency of Woodrow Wilson|Wilson Administration]]'s conclusion of a treaty that expressed "sincere regret" for the way in which the United States had acquired the Panama Canal Zone, he was impressed by many of the reforms passed under Wilson. Roosevelt made several campaign appearances for the Progressives, but the [[1914 United States elections|1914 elections]] were a disaster for the fledgling third party.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=539–540}} Roosevelt began to envision another campaign for president, this time with himself at the head of the Republican Party, but conservative party leaders remained opposed to Roosevelt.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=548–549}} In hopes of engineering a joint nomination, the Progressives scheduled the [[1916 Progressive National Convention]] at the same time as the [[1916 Republican National Convention]]. When the Republicans nominated Charles Evans Hughes, Roosevelt declined the Progressive nomination and urged his Progressive followers to support the Republican candidate.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=550–551}} Though Roosevelt had long disliked Hughes, he disliked Wilson even more, and he campaigned energetically for the Republican nominee. However, Wilson won the [[1916 United States presidential election|1916 election]] by a narrow margin.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=552–553}} The Progressives disappeared as a party following the 1916 election, and Roosevelt and many of his followers permanently re-joined the Republican Party.<ref name="mmcgeary1">{{cite journal|last1=McGeary|first1=M.

===World War I===
When the First World War began in 1914, Roosevelt strongly supported the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and demanded a harsher policy against Germany, especially regarding submarine warfare. Roosevelt angrily denounced the foreign policy of President Wilson, calling it a failure regarding the [[Rape of Belgium|atrocities in Belgium]] and the violations of American rights.{{sfn|Brands|1997|pp=749–751, 806–809}} In 1916, while campaigning for Hughes, Roosevelt repeatedly denounced Irish-Americans and German-Americans whom he described as unpatriotic, saying they put the interests of Ireland and Germany ahead of America's by supporting neutrality. He insisted that one had to be 100% American, not a "[[hyphenated American]]" who juggled multiple loyalties. In March 1917, Congress gave Roosevelt the authority to raise a maximum of four divisions similar to the [[Rough Riders]], and Major [[Frederick Russell Burnham]] was put in charge of both the general organization and recruitment.{{sfn|Roosevelt|1917|p=347}}<ref name="NYT-1917-0313">{{cite news |title=Enroll Westerners for Service in War; Movement to Register Men of That Region Begun at the Rocky Mountain Club.

===League of Nations===
{{Further|League to Enforce Peace}}
Roosevelt was an early supporter of the modern view that there needs to be a global order. In his Nobel prize address of 1910, he said, "it would be a master stroke if those great Powers honestly bent on peace would form a League of Peace, not only to keep the peace among themselves, but to prevent, by force if necessary, its being broken by others."<ref>Henry F. Pringle, ''Theodore Roosevelt: A Biography'' (1931) p. 519</ref> It would have executive power such as the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]] lacked. He called for American participation.

When [[World War I]] broke out, Roosevelt proposed "a World League for the Peace of Righteousness", in September 1914, which would preserve sovereignty but limit armaments and require arbitration. He added that it should be "solemnly covenanted that if any nations refused to abide by the decisions of such a court, then others draw the sword in behalf of peace and justice."<ref>{{cite book |author=J. Lee Thompson |title=Never Call Retreat: Theodore Roosevelt and the Great War |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WQyxAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA33 |year=2014 |pages=32–34 |isbn=978-1-137-30653-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Richard M.

Though Roosevelt had some concerns about the impact on United States sovereignty, he insisted that such a league would only work if the United States participated as one of the "joint guarantors".{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=562–564}} Roosevelt referred to this plan in a 1918 speech as "the most feasible for...a league of nations."<ref>William Clinton Olson, " Theodore Roosevelt's Conception of an International League" ''World Affairs Quarterly'' (1959) 29#3 pp. 329–353.</ref><ref>Stephen Wertheim, "The league that wasn't: American designs for a legalist-sanctionist league of nations and the intellectual origins of international organization, 1914–1920." ''Diplomatic History'' 35.5 (2011): 797–836.</ref> By this time Wilson was strongly hostile to Roosevelt and Lodge, and developed his own plans for a rather different League of Nations. It became reality along Wilson's lines at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919. Roosevelt denounced Wilson's approach but died before it was adopted at Paris. However, Lodge was willing to accept it with serious reservations. In the end, on March 19, 1920, Wilson had Democratic Senators vote against the League with the [[Lodge Reservations]] and the United States never joined the League of Nations.<ref>David Mervin, "Henry Cabot Lodge and the League of Nations." ''Journal of American Studies'' 4#2 (1971): 201–214. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27552941 online]</ref>

===Final political activities===
Roosevelt's attacks on Wilson helped the Republicans win control of Congress in the midterm elections of 1918. He declined a request from New York Republicans to run for another gubernatorial term, but attacked Wilson's [[Fourteen Points]], calling instead for the unconditional surrender of Germany. Though his health was uncertain, he was seen as a leading contender for the 1920 Republican nomination, but insisted that, "If they take me, they'll have to take me without a single modification of the things that I have always stood for! {{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=559}} He wrote William Allen White, "I wish to do everything in my power to make the Republican Party the Party of sane, constructive radicalism, just as it was under Lincoln." Accordingly, he told the 1918 state convention of the Maine Republican Party that he stood for old-age pensions, insurance for sickness and unemployment, construction of public housing for low-income families, the reduction of working hours, aid to farmers, and more regulation of large corporations.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|p=559}}

While his political profile remained high, Roosevelt's physical condition continued to deteriorate throughout 1918 due to the long-term effects of jungle diseases. He was hospitalized for seven weeks late in the year and never fully recovered.{{Sfn|Miller|1992|pp=564–566}}

==Death==
[[File:Theodore and Edith Roosevelt Grave.jpg|thumb|right|Theodore and Edith Roosevelt's Grave at Youngs Memorial Cemetery]]
On the night of January 5, 1919, Roosevelt suffered breathing problems. After receiving treatment from his physician, Dr. George W. Faller, he felt better and went to bed. Roosevelt's last words were "Please put out that light, James" to his family servant [[James E. Amos]].

Roosevelt was a prolific author, writing with passion on subjects ranging from foreign policy to the importance of the national park system. Roosevelt was also an avid reader of poetry. Poet [[Robert Frost]] said that Roosevelt "was our kind. He quoted poetry to me. He knew poetry."<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.igougo.com/review-r1150273-Light_gone_out_-_TR_at_the_Library_of_Congress.html | title= "Light gone out" – TR at the Library of Congress – Jefferson's Legacy: The Library of Congress Review |publisher=IgoUgo | access-date = October 31, 2011}}</ref>

As an editor of ''Outlook'' magazine, Roosevelt had weekly access to a large, educated national audience. In all, Roosevelt wrote about 18 books (each in several editions), including his autobiography,<ref>{{Cite book | last = Roosevelt | first = Theodore | author-link = Theodore Roosevelt | title = An Autobiography | publisher = Echo Library | year = 2006 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VZi1sGSjFfEC | isbn = 978-1-4068-0155-2}}</ref> ''The Rough Riders'',<ref>{{Cite book | last = Roosevelt | first = Theodore | author-link = Theodore Roosevelt | title = The Rough Riders | publisher = The Review of Reviews Company | year = 1904 | location = New York | url = https://archive.org/details/roughriders00roos}}</ref> ''History of the Naval War of 1812'',<ref>{{Cite book | last = Roosevelt | first = Theodore | author-link = Theodore Roosevelt | title = The Naval War of 1812 | publisher = G.P.

His most ambitious book was the four volume narrative ''The Winning of the West'', focused on the [[American frontier]] in the 18th and early 19th centuries. Roosevelt said that the American character—indeed a new "American race" (ethnic group) had emerged from the heroic wilderness hunters and Indian fighters, acting on the frontier with little government help.<ref>Richard Slotkin, "Nostalgia and progress: Theodore Roosevelt's myth of the frontier". ''American Quarterly'' (1981) 33#5 pp: 608–637.

In 1907, Roosevelt became embroiled in a widely publicized literary debate known as the [[nature fakers controversy]]. A few years earlier, naturalist [[John Burroughs]] had published an article entitled "Real and Sham Natural History" in the ''Atlantic Monthly'', attacking popular writers of the day such as [[Ernest Thompson Seton]], [[Charles G. D. Roberts]], and [[William J. Long]] for their fantastical representations of wildlife. Roosevelt agreed with Burroughs's criticisms, and published several essays of his own denouncing the booming genre of "naturalistic" animal stories as "yellow journalism of the woods". It was the President himself who popularized the negative term "nature faker" to describe writers who depicted their animal characters with excessive anthropomorphism.<ref>{{Citation | last = Carson | first = Gerald |date=February 1971 | url = http://www.americanheritage.com/content/tr-and-%E2%80%9Cnature-fakers%E2%80%9D | title = Roosevelt and the 'nature fakers' | newspaper = American Heritage Magazine | volume = 22 | issue = 2}}.</ref>

==Character and beliefs==
[[File:SagamoreHill.JPG|thumb|left|[[Sagamore Hill]], Roosevelt's [[Long Island]] estate]]

Roosevelt intensely disliked being called "Teddy", despite the widespread public association with said moniker, and was quick to point out this to those who referred to him as such, though it would become widely used by newspapers during his political career.

He was an active [[Freemason]]<ref>{{cite web |title= THEODORE ROOSEVELT |url= http://mdmasons.org/about-md-masons/famous-masons/theodore-roosevelt/ |website= mdmasons.org |publisher= The Grand Lodge of Maryland |access-date= February 15, 2021}}</ref> and member of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]].<ref>{{Citation |contribution-url= http://www.sar.org/About/Origins |contribution= The Origins of the SAR |title= About |publisher= SAR}}.</ref>

British scholar [[Marcus Cunliffe]] evaluates the liberal argument that Roosevelt was an opportunist, exhibitionist, and imperialist. Cunliffe praises TR's versatility, his respect for law, and his sincerity. He argues that Roosevelt's foreign policy was better than his detractors allege. Cunliffe calls him "a big man in several respects," ranking him below Washington, Lincoln, and Jefferson, and on the same level as Franklin D. Roosevelt.<ref>Marcus Cunliffe, "Theodore Roosevelt, President of the United States 1901–1908" ''History Today'' (Sept 1955) 4#9 pp592-601.</ref>

===Strenuous life===
Roosevelt had a lifelong interest in pursuing what he called, in an 1899 speech, "[[The Strenuous Life]]". To this end, he exercised regularly and took up boxing, tennis, hiking, rowing, polo, and horseback riding. He also continued his habit of [[skinny-dipping]] in the [[Potomac River]] during the winter.{{Sfn|Thayer|1919|loc=Chapter XVII|pp=22–24}}<ref>{{Citation |last1= Shaw |first1= KB |last2= Maiden |first2= David |year= 2006 |url= http://www.incwell.com/Biographies/Presidents/Roosevelt,Theodore.html |contribution= Theodore Roosevelt |title= Biographies |publisher= Inc well |access-date= March 7, 2006}}.</ref> As governor of New York, he boxed with sparring partners several times each week, a practice he regularly continued as president until being hit so hard in the face he became blind in his left eye (a fact not made public until many years later). As president, he practiced [[judo]] for two 2-month periods in 1902 and 1904, not attaining any rank.<ref>{{Citation |last1= ukemi |year= 2019 |url= https://martialarts.stackexchange.com/questions/2209/what-level-of-expertise-did-theodore-roosevelt-have-in-judo |contribution= Theodore Roosevelt |title= Roosevelt's Judo experience |publisher= Stack Exchange |access-date= April 10, 2020}}.</ref> Roosevelt began to believe in the utility of jiu-jitsu training after training with [[Yamashita Yoshitsugu|Yoshitsugu Yamashita]].

To prove their point, Martha Blow Wadsworth and Maria Louise ("Hallie") Davis Elkins hired Fude Yamashita, a highly skilled jiu-jitsu instructor and the wife of Yoshitsugu Yamashita, to teach a jiu-jitsu class for women and girls in Washington, DC in 1904. Women had already begun training in boxing in the United States as a means of personal and political empowerment. Jiu-jitsu training thus soon also became popular with American women, coinciding with the origins of a women's self-defense movement.<ref>{{Cite book |last= Rouse |first= Wendy |url= https://nyupress.org/9781479828531/her-own-hero/ |title= Her Own Hero: The Origins of the Women's Self-Defense Movement |publisher= New York University Press |year= 2017 |isbn= 978-1-4798-0729-1 |location= New York}}</ref>

Roosevelt was an enthusiastic [[singlestick]] player and, according to ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', showed up at a White House reception with his arm bandaged after a bout with General [[Leonard Wood]] in 1905.<ref>{{citation |last= Amberger |first= J Christoph |title= Secret History of the Sword Adventures in Ancient Martial Arts |year= 1998 |isbn= 1-892515-04-0}}.</ref> Roosevelt was an avid reader, reading tens of thousands of books, at a rate of several per day in multiple languages.

===Warrior===
[[File:1905 cartoon Theodore Roosevelt first and war first in peace.jpg|thumb|right|"The Man of the Hour" Roosevelt as Warrior in 1898 and Peacemaker in 1905 settling war between Russia and Japan]]

Historians have often emphasized Roosevelt's warrior persona.<ref>Kathleen Dalton notes that historians have preferred retelling the "oft-repeated accounts of warmongering." {{harvnb|Dalton|2002|p=522}}.</ref> He took aggressive positions regarding war with Spain in 1898, [[History of the Panama Canal|Colombia in 1903]],<ref>Richard W. Turk, "The United States Navy and the 'Taking' of Panama, 1901–1903." ''Journal of Military History'' 38.3 (1974): 92+.</ref> and especially with Germany, from 1915 to 1917. As a demonstration of American naval might, he sent the "[[Great White Fleet]]" around the world in 1907–1909.<ref>James R. Holmes, "'A Striking Thing' Leadership, Strategic Communications, and Roosevelt's Great White Fleet." ''Naval War College Review'' 61.1 (2008): 50–67. [https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a519197.pdf online]</ref> The implicit threat of the "big stick" of military power provided leverage to "speak softly" and quietly resolve conflict in numerous cases.<ref>Kathleen M. Dalton, "Making Biographical Judgments: Was Theodore Roosevelt a Warmonger?" ''OAH Magazine of History'' (13#3) (1999) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/25163290 online]</ref> He boasted in his autobiography:
{{quote|When I left the Presidency I finished seven and a half years of administration, during which not one shot had been fired against a foreign foe. We were at absolute peace, and there was no nation in the world with whom a war cloud threatened, no nation in the world whom we had wronged, or from whom we had anything to fear.

Richard D. White Jr states, "Roosevelt's warrior spirit framed his views of national politics, [and] international relations."<ref>{{cite book |author= Richard D. White Jr |title= Roosevelt the Reformer: Theodore Roosevelt as Civil Service Commissioner, 1889–1895 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=58CjuCB9m0MC&pg=PA146 |year= 2003 |publisher= U of Alabama Press |page= 146 |isbn= 978-0-8173-1361-6}}</ref>

Historian [[Howard K. Beale]] has argued:
{{quote|He and his associates came close to seeking war for its own sake. Ignorant of modern war, Roosevelt romanticized war. ... Like many young men tamed by civilization into law-abiding but adventurous living, he needed an outlet for the pent-up primordial man in him and found it in fighting and killing, vicariously or directly, in hunting or in war. Indeed he had a fairly good time in war when war came. ... There was something dull and effeminate about peace. ... He gloried in war, was thrilled by military history, and placed warlike qualities high in his scale of values. Without consciously desiring it, he thought a little war now and then stimulated admirable qualities in men. Certainly preparedness for war did.{{sfn|Beale|1956|p=48}}}}

===Religion===
Roosevelt attended church regularly and was a lifelong adherent of the [[Reformed Church in America]], an American affiliate of the [[Dutch Reformed Church]]. In 1907, concerning the motto "[[In God We Trust]]" on money, he wrote, "It seems to me eminently unwise to cheapen such a motto by use on coins, just as it would be to cheapen it by use on postage stamps, or in advertisements." Roosevelt talked a great deal about religion. Biographer [[Edmund Morris (writer)|Edmund Morris]] states:
{{quote|When consoling bereaved people, he would awkwardly invoke 'unseen and unknown powers.' Aside from a few clichés of Protestant rhetoric, the gospel he preached had always been political and pragmatic. He was inspired less by the Passion of Christ than by the Golden Rule—that appeal to reason amounting, in his mind, to a worldly rather than heavenly law.<ref>{{cite book |author= Edmund Morris |title= Colonel Roosevelt |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ouQVJQ1C7PIC&pg=PT62 |year= 2010 |publisher= Random House |page= 62 |isbn= 978-0-679-60415-0}}</ref>}}

Roosevelt publicly encouraged church attendance and was a conscientious churchgoer himself. When gas rationing was introduced during the First World War, he walked the three miles from his home at Sagamore Hill to the local church and back, even after a serious operation had made it difficult for him to travel by foot.<ref>{{Cite book |title= Roosevelt's Religion |last= Reisner |first= Christian F. |publisher= The Abingdon Press |year= 1922 |page= 355}}</ref> It was said that Roosevelt "allowed no engagement to keep him from going to church," and he remained a fervent advocate of the Bible throughout his adult life.<ref>{{Cite book |title= Roosevelt's Religion |last= Reisner |first= Christian F. |publisher= The Abingdon Press |year= 1922 |page= 357}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |title= Roosevelt's Religion |last= Reisner |first= Christian F. |publisher= The Abingdon Press |year= 1922 |pages= 305–323}}</ref> According to Christian F.

{{quote |Every thinking man, when he thinks, realizes what a very large number of people tend to forget, that the teachings of the Bible are so interwoven and entwined with our whole civic and social life that it would be literally—I do not mean figuratively, I mean literally—impossible for us to figure to ourselves what that life would be if these teachings were removed. We would lose almost all the standards by which we now judge both public and private morals; all the standards toward which we, with more or less of resolution, strive to raise ourselves. Almost every man who has by his lifework added to the sum of human achievement of which the race is proud, has based his lifework largely upon the teachings of the Bible ... Among the greatest men a disproportionately large number have been diligent and close students of the Bible at first hand.<ref name="Reisner 1922 306"/>}}

==Political positions==
{{Main |Political positions of Theodore Roosevelt}}

When he assumed the presidency, Roosevelt reassured many conservatives, stating, "the mechanism of modern business is so delicate that extreme care must be taken not to interfere with it in a spirit of rashness or ignorance."{{Sfn|Leuchtenburg|2015|pp=30–31}} The following year, Roosevelt asserted the president's independence from business interests by opposing the merger which created the [[Northern Securities Company]], and many were surprised that any president, much less an unelected one, would challenge powerful banker [[J.P. Morgan]].{{Sfn|Leuchtenburg|2015|pp=32–33}} In his last two years as president, Roosevelt became increasingly distrustful of big business, despite its close ties to the Republican Party.<ref>Gary Murphy in "Theodore Roosevelt, Presidential Power and the Regulation of the Market" in Serge Ricard, ed. ''A companion to Theodore Roosevelt'' (2011) pp. 154–172.</ref> Roosevelt sought to replace the 19th-century [[laissez-faire]] economic environment with a new economic model which included a larger regulatory role for the federal government. He believed that 19th-century entrepreneurs had risked their fortunes on innovations and new businesses, and that these capitalists had been rightly rewarded. By contrast, he believed that 20th-century capitalists risked little but nonetheless reaped huge and, given the lack of risk, unjust, economic rewards. Without a redistribution of wealth away from the upper class, Roosevelt feared that the country would turn to radicals or fall to revolution.<ref>Morris (2001) pp. 430–431, 436</ref> His [[Square Deal]] domestic program had three main goals: conservation of natural resources, control of corporations, and consumer protection.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www4.bluevalleyk12.org/bvhs/mklopfenstein/Apush_notes/Unit_VI/THE%20PROGRESSIVE%20ERA(post).pdf |title=The Progressive Era (1900–1920) |first=Mark |last=Klopfenstein |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626045617/http://www4.bluevalleyk12.org/bvhs/mklopfenstein/Apush_notes/Unit_VI/THE%20PROGRESSIVE%20ERA(post).pdf |archive-date=June 26, 2013 |access-date=January 18, 2019}}</ref> The Square Deal evolved into his program of "[[New Nationalism (Theodore Roosevelt)|New Nationalism]]", which emphasized the priority of labor over capital interests and a need to more effectively control corporate creation and combination, and proposed a ban on corporate political contributions.{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=675}}

===Foreign policy beliefs===
In the analysis by [[Henry Kissinger]], Theodore Roosevelt was the first president to develop the guideline that it was America's duty to make its enormous power and potential influence felt globally. The idea of being a passive "city on the hill" model that others could look up to, he rejected. Roosevelt, trained in biology, was a [[Social Darwinism|social darwinist]] who believed in survival of the fittest.  The international world in his view was a realm of violence and conflict. The United States had  all the economic and geographical potential to be the fittest nation on the globe.<ref>Henry Kissinger, ''[[Diplomacy (book)|Diplomacy]]'' (1994, pp. 38–40).</ref>  The United States had a duty to act decisively. For example in terms of the [[Monroe Doctrine]], America had to prevent European incursions in the Western Hemisphere. But there was more, as he expressed in his famous [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the Monroe Doctrine: the U.S. had to be the policeman of the region because unruly, corrupt smaller nations had to be controlled, and if United States did not do it, European powers would in fact intervene and develop their own base of power in the hemisphere in contravention to the Monroe Doctrine.<ref> Kissinger, ''Diplomacy,'' pp. 38–39</ref> 

Roosevelt was a realist and a conservative.<ref> Stephen G. Walker, and Mark Schafer, "Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson as cultural icons of US foreign policy." ''Political Psychology'' 28.6 (2007): 747–776 https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9221.2007.00602.x </ref> He deplored many of the increasingly popular idealistic liberal themes, such as were promoted by [[William Jennings Bryan]], the anti-imperialists, and [[Woodrow Wilson]]. Kissinger says he rejected the efficacy of international law. Roosevelt argue that if a country could not protect its own interests, the international community could not help very much. He ridiculed disarmament proposals that were increasingly common. He saw no likelihood of a international power capable of checking wrongdoing on a major scale. As for world government:<blockquote> I regard the Wilson–Bryan attitude of trusting to fantastic peace treaties, too impossible promises, to all kinds of scraps of paper without any backing in efficient force, as abhorrent. It is infinitely better for a nation and for the world to have the Frederick the Great and Bismarck tradition as regards foreign policy than to have the Bryan or Bryan–Wilson attitude as a permanent national attitude.... A milk-and-water righteousness unbacked by force is...as wicked as and even more mischievous than force divorced from righteousness.<ref> Kissinger, ''Diplomacy'' p. 40:</ref></blockquote>

On the positive side, Roosevelt favored spheres of influence, whereby one great power would generally prevail, such as the United States in the Western Hemisphere or Great Britain in the Indian subcontinent. Japan fit that role and he approved. However he had deep distrust of both Germany and Russia.<ref>Kissinger, pp. 40–42.</ref>

==Legacy==
Historians credit Roosevelt for changing the nation's political system by permanently placing the "[[bully pulpit]]" of the presidency at center stage and making [[Character (persona)|character]] as important as the issues. His accomplishments include trust busting and conservationism. He is a hero to [[Liberalism in the United States|liberals]] and [[Progressivism in the United States|progressives]] for his proposals in 1907–1912 that presaged the modern welfare state of the [[New Deal]] Era, including [[Direct tax|direct federal taxation]], [[Labour movement|labor reforms]], and more [[direct democracy]], while [[conservationists]] admire Roosevelt for putting the [[Environmentalism|environment]] and [[Altruism|selflessness]] towards future generations on the national agenda, and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] and [[American nationalism|nationalists]] respect his commitment to [[Law and order (politics)|law and order]], [[Civic engagement|civic duty]] and [[Military history of the United States|military values]], as well as his personality of individual [[Personal responsibility|self-responsibility]] and hardiness. Dalton says, "Today he is heralded as the architect of the modern presidency, as a world leader who boldly reshaped the office to meet the needs of the new century and redefined America's place in the world."{{Sfn|Dalton|2002|pp=4–5}}

However, liberals and [[Socialism|socialists]] have criticized him for his [[Intervention (international law)|interventionist]] and [[American imperialism|imperialist]] approach to nations he considered "[[Racism in the United States|uncivilized]]". Conservatives and [[Libertarianism in the United States|libertarians]] reject his vision of the welfare state and emphasis on the superiority of government over private action. [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|Historians typically rank]] Roosevelt among the top five presidents in American history.<ref>{{cite web|title=Theodore Roosevelt Biography: Impact and Legacy|website=American President|url=http://www.americanpresident.org/history/theodoreroosevelt/biography/ImpactLegacy.common.shtml|year=2003|publisher=[[Miller Center of Public Affairs]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050418002524/http://www.americanpresident.org/history/theodoreroosevelt/biography/ImpactLegacy.common.shtml|archive-date=April 18, 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Legacy: Theodore Roosevelt|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/presidents/26_t_roosevelt/t_roosevelt_legacy.html|publisher=PBS|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040417225355/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/presidents/26_t_roosevelt/t_roosevelt_legacy.html|archive-date=April 17, 2004}}.</ref>

===Persona and masculinity===
[[File:Many Roles of Theodore Roosevelt.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|1910 cartoon showing Roosevelt's many roles from 1899 to 1910]]

Dalton says Roosevelt is remembered as, "one of the most picturesque personalities who has ever enlivened the landscape".{{Sfn|Dalton|2002|p=5}} His friend, historian [[Henry Adams]], proclaimed: "Roosevelt, more than any other man... showed the singular primitive quality that belongs to ultimate matter—the quality that medieval theology assigned to God—he was pure act."<ref>{{cite book| first =Henry | last = Adams | title =The Education of Henry Adams: An Autobiography| publisher =Houghton Mifflin Company |url= https://archive.org/details/educationofhenry002024mbp | year=1918|page= [https://archive.org/details/educationofhenry002024mbp/page/n436 417]}}</ref>

Roosevelt's biographers have stressed his personality. [[Henry F. Pringle]], who won the Pulitzer Prize in biography for his ''Theodore Roosevelt'' (1931) stated: "The Theodore Roosevelt of later years was the most adolescent of men… Failure to receive the Medal of Honor for his exploits [in Cuba] had been a grief as real as any of those which swamp childhood in despair. 'You must always remember,' wrote [[Cecil Spring Rice]] in 1904, 'that the President is about six.'"<ref>Pringle, ''Theodore Roosevelt: A Biography'' (1931) p. 4. [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.58403/page/n18 online]</ref>

Cooper compared him with Woodrow Wilson and argued that both of them played the roles of warrior and priest.{{Sfn|Cooper|1983}} Dalton stressed Roosevelt's strenuous life.{{Sfn|Dalton|2002}} Sarah Watts examined the desires of the "Rough Rider in the White House".{{Sfn|Watts|2003}} Brands calls Roosevelt "the last romantic", arguing that his romantic concept of life emerged from his belief that "physical bravery was the highest virtue and war the ultimate test of bravery".{{Sfn|Brands|1997|p=x}}

For his gallantry at San Juan Hill, Roosevelt's commanders recommended him for the [[Medal of Honor]]. However, the initial recommendation lacked any eyewitnesses, and the effort was eventually tainted by Roosevelt's own lobbying of the War Department.<ref>Mears, The Medal of Honor, 153–154</ref> In the late 1990s, Roosevelt's supporters again recommended the award, which was denied by the Secretary of the Army on basis that the decorations board determined "Roosevelt's bravery in battle did not rise to the level that would justify the Medal of Honor and, indeed, it did not rise to the level of men who fought in that engagement."<ref>Mears, The Medal of Honor, 154</ref> Nevertheless, politicians apparently convinced the secretary to reconsider the award a third time and reverse himself, leading to the charge that it was a "politically motivated award."<ref>Mears, The Medal of Honor, 155</ref> On January 16, 2001, President [[Bill Clinton]] awarded Theodore Roosevelt the Medal of Honor posthumously for his charge on San Juan Hill.<ref name=MoH2001>{{cite book|last=Woodall|first=James R.|title=Williams-Ford Texas A and M University Military History: Texas Aggie Medals of Honor: Seven Heroes of World War Ii|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QBSRPbx44bIC&pg=PA18|year=2010|publisher=Texas A&M University Press|page=18|isbn=978-1-60344-253-4}}</ref> He is the only president to have received the Medal of Honor.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dorr|first1=Robert F.|title=Theodore Roosevelt's Medal of Honor|url=https://www.defensemedianetwork.com/stories/theodore-roosevelts-medal-of-honor/|publisher=Defense Media Network|date=July 1, 2015|access-date=February 12, 2018}}</ref>
