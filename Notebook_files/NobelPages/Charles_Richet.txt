Professor '''Charles Robert Richet''' (25 August 1850 – 4 December 1935) was a French [[Physiology|physiologist]] at the [[Collège de France]] known for his pioneering work in [[immunology]]. In 1913, he won the [[Nobel Prize]] in Physiology or Medicine "in recognition of his work on [[anaphylaxis]]". Richet devoted many years to the study of [[paranormal]] and [[spiritualism|spiritualist]] phenomena, coining the term "[[Ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]]". He also believed in the inferiority of Black people, was a proponent of [[eugenics]] and presided over the French Eugenics Society towards the end of his life. The Richet line of professorships of medical science would continue through his son Charles and his grandson Gabriel.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dworetzky|first=Murray|last2=Cohen|first2=Sheldon|last3=Cohen|first3=Sheldon G.|last4=Zelaya-Quesada|first4=Myrna|date=August 2002|title=Portier, Richet, and the discovery of anaphylaxis: A centennial|journal=Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology|volume=110|issue=2|pages=331–336|doi=10.1016/S0091-6749(02)70118-8}}</ref> Gabriel Richet was one of the great pioneers of European [[nephrology]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Piccoli|first=Giorgina Barbara|last2=Richiero|first2=Gilberto|last3=Jaar|first3=Bernard G.|date=13 March 2018|title=The Pioneers of Nephrology – Professor Gabriel Richet: "I will maintain"|journal=BMC Nephrology|volume=19|issue=1|pages=60|doi=10.1186/s12882-018-0862-0|issn=1471-2369|pmc=5851327|pmid=29534697}}</ref>

==Career==
[[File:Charles Richet 1922.jpg|thumb|Richet in 1922]]
He was born on 25 August 1850 in [[Paris]] the son of Alfred Richet. He was educated at the Lycee Bonaparte in Paris then studied Medicine at university in Paris.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0-902-198-84-X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf|access-date=19 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074135/https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Richet spent a period of time as an intern at the Salpêtrière hospital in Paris, where he observed [[Jean-Martin Charcot]]'s work with then so called "hysterical" patients.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In 1887, Richet became [[professor]] of [[physiology]] at the [[Collège de France]] investigating a variety of subjects such as [[neurochemistry]], [[digestion]], [[thermoregulation]] in [[Homeothermy|homeothermic]] animals, and [[breathing]].<ref name="Stewart 2012">Wolf, Stewart. (2012). ''Brain, Mind, and Medicine: Charles Richet and the Origins of Physiological Psychology''. Transaction Publishers. pp. 1–101. {{ISBN|1-56000-063-5}}</ref> In 1898, he became a member of the [[Académie de Médecine]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
In 1913, his work with [[Paul Portier (immunologist)|Paul Portier]] on [[anaphylaxis]] the term he coined for a sensitized individual's sometimes lethal reaction to a second, small-dose injection of an [[antigen]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].<ref name="Stewart 2012"/><ref name="nobel">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1913/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1913 Charles Richet|publisher=Nobelprize.org|access-date=5 July 2010}}</ref> The research helped elucidate [[hay fever]], [[asthma]] and other [[Allergy|allergic reaction]]s to foreign substances and explained some previously not understood cases of [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]] and [[sudden cardiac death|sudden death]]. In 1914, he became a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences|Académie des Sciences]].<ref name="Stewart 2012"/>

Richet discovered the analgesic drug [[chloralose]] with <ref name="Tabori 1972">[[Paul Tabori|Tabori, Paul]]. (1972). ''Charles Richet''. In ''Pioneers of the Unseen''. Souvenir Press. pp. 98–132. {{ISBN|0-285-62042-8}}</ref>

Richet had many interests, and he wrote books about [[history]], [[sociology]], [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], as well as [[theatre]] and [[poetry]]. He was a pioneer in [[aviation]].<ref name="Stewart 2012"/>

He was involved in the French pacifist movement. Starting in 1902, pacifist societies began to meet at a National Peace Congress, often with several hundred attendees. Unable to unify the pacifist forces they set up a small permanent delegation of French Pacifist Societies in 1902, which Richet led, together with [[Lucien Le Foyer]] as Secretary-General.<ref>{{cite book|chapter-url=http://jmguieu.free.fr/Enseignements/L3_France_Allemagne_Europe/TD_06_pacifisme.htm |last=Guieu |first=Jean-Michel|chapter=6 – Tensions nationalistes et efforts pacifistes|language=fr |year=2005|title=La France, l'Allemagne et l'Europe (1871–1945)|access-date=11 March 2015}}</ref>

==Parapsychology==
Richet held a deep interest in [[extrasensory perception]] and [[hypnosis]]. In 1884, [[Alexandr Aksakov]] interested him in the [[Mediumship|medium]] of [[Eusapia Palladino]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In 1891, Richet founded the ''Annales des sciences psychiques''. He kept in touch with renowned [[Occultism|occultists]] and [[Spiritualism|spiritualists]] of his time such as [[Albert von Schrenck-Notzing]], [[Frederic William Henry Myers]] and [[Gabriel Delanne]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In 1919, Richet became honorary chairman of the [[Institut Métapsychique International]] in [[Paris]], and, in 1930, full-time president.<ref>[http://www.metapsychique.org/Charles-Richet.html "Charles Richet"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311051340/http://www.metapsychique.org/Charles-Richet.html |date=11 March 2016 }}. Institut Métapsychique International.</ref>

As a scientist, Richet was positive about a physical explanation for [[paranormal]] phenomena.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Alvarado |first=C.

[[File:Linda Gazzera medium 2.png|thumb|[[Linda Gazzera]] a medium Richet investigated, in Paris, 1909.]]

In 1894, Richet coined the term [[ectoplasm (paranormal)|ectoplasm]].<ref>Blom, Jan Dirk. (2010). ''A Dictionary of Hallucinations''. Springer. p. 168. {{ISBN|978-1-4419-1222-0}}</ref> Richet believed that some [[mediumship]] could be explained physically due to the external projection of a material substance (ectoplasm) from the body of the medium, but denied this substance had anything to do with spirits. He rejected the [[Spiritualism|spirit hypothesis]] of mediumship as unscientific, instead supporting the sixth sense hypothesis.<ref name="Tabori 1972"/><ref>Ashby, Robert H. (1972). ''The Guidebook for the Study of Psychical Research''. Rider. pp. 162–179</ref> According to Richet:

<blockquote>It seems to me prudent not to give credence to the spiritistic hypothesis... it appears to me still (at the present time, at all events) improbable, for it contradicts (at least apparently) the most precise and definite data of physiology, whereas the hypothesis of the sixth sense is a new physiological notion which contradicts nothing that we learn from physiology. Consequently, although in certain rare cases spiritism supplies an apparently simpler explanation, I cannot bring myself to accept it. When we have fathomed the history of these unknown vibrations emanating from reality – past reality, present reality, and even future reality – we shall doubtless have given them an unwonted degree of importance. The history of the Hertzian waves shows us the ubiquity of these vibrations in the external world, imperceptible to our senses.<ref name="Richet 1928"/></blockquote>

He hypothesized a "sixth sense", an ability to perceive hypothetical vibrations, which he discussed in his 1928 book ''Our Sixth Sense''.<ref name="Richet 1928">Richet, Charles. (nd, ca 1928). ''Our Sixth Sense''. London: Rider. (First published in French, 1928)</ref> Although he believed in extrasensory perception, Richet did not believe in [[life after death]] or spirits.<ref name="Tabori 1972"/>

He investigated and studied various mediums such as [[Eva Carrière]], [[William Eglinton]], [[Pascal Forthuny]], [[Stefan Ossowiecki]], [[Leonora Piper]] and [[Raphael Schermann]].<ref name="Tabori 1972"/> From 1905–1910, Richet attended many séances with the medium [[Linda Gazzera]] claiming she was a genuine medium who had performed [[psychokinesis]], i.e. that various objects had been moved in the séance room.<ref name="Tabori 1972"/> Gazzera was exposed as a fraud in 1911.<ref>[[Joseph McCabe|McCabe, Joseph]]. (1920). ''Is Spiritualism Based On Fraud? The Evidence Given By Sir A. C. Doyle and Others Drastically Examined''. London Watts & Co. pp. 33–34</ref> Richet was also fooled into believing [[Joaquin María Argamasilla]], known as the "Spaniard with X-ray Eyes", had genuine [[psychic]] powers,<ref>[[Massimo Polidoro|Polidoro, Massimo]].

The University Press of Kentucky. p. 215. {{ISBN|978-0813124674}}</ref> According to [[Joseph McCabe]], Richet was also duped by the fraudulent mediums Eva Carrière and [[Eusapia Palladino]].<ref>[[Joseph McCabe|McCabe, Joseph]]. (1920). ''Scientific Men and Spiritualism: A Skeptic's Analysis''. The Living Age. 12 June. pp. 652–657.</ref>

Historian [[Ruth Brandon]] also criticized Richet as credulous when it came to psychical research, noting "his will to believe, and his disinclination to accept any unpalatably contrary indications".<ref>[[Ruth Brandon|Brandon, Ruth]]. (1983). ''The Spiritualists: The Passion for the Occult in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries''. Weidenfeld and Nicolson. p. 135</ref>

===Eva Carrière===
In 1905, [[Eva Carrière]] held a series of [[séance]]s at Villa Carmen and sitters were invited. In these séances she claimed to materialize a spirit called Bien Boa a 300-year-old Brahmin [[Hindu]], however, photographs taken of Boa looked like the figure was made from a large cardboard cutout.<ref>[[Raymond Buckland|Buckland, Raymond]]. (2005). ''The Spirit Book: The Encyclopedia of Clairvoyance, Channeling, and Spirit Communication''. Visible Ink Press. p. 131. {{ISBN|978-1578592135}}</ref> In other sittings Richet reported that Boa was breathing, had moved around the room and had touched him, a photograph taken revealed Boa to be a man dressed up in a [[cloak]], [[helmet]] and beard.<ref>Brower, M. Brady. (2010). ''Unruly Spirits: The Science of Psychic Phenomena in Modern France''. University of Illinois Press. pp. 84–86. {{ISBN|978-0-252-03564-7}}</ref>

A newspaper article in 1906 had revealed that an Arab coachman known as Areski who had previously worked at the villa had been hired to play the part of Bien Boa and that the entire thing was a [[hoax]]. Areski wrote that he made his appearance into the room by a trapdoor. Carrière had also admitted to being involved with the hoax.<ref>Aykroyd, Peter H.; Narth, Angela and Aykroyd, Dan (2009).

===Eusapia Palladino===
[[File:Isle Roubaud in Mediterranean.png|thumb|Photograph of Isle Roubaud in the Mediterranean.]]

Richet with Oliver Lodge, [[Frederic W. H. Myers]] and [[Julian Ochorowicz]] investigated the medium [[Eusapia Palladino]] in the summer of 1894 at his house in the Ile Roubaud in the Mediterranean. Richet claimed furniture moved during the séance and that some of the phenomena was the result of a supernatural agency.<ref name="Mann1919">Mann, Walter (1919). [https://archive.org/stream/folliesfraudsofs00manniala#page/114/mode/2up ''The Follies and Frauds of Spiritualism'']. Rationalist Association. London: Watts & Co. pp. 115–130</ref> However, [[Richard Hodgson (parapsychologist)|Richard Hodgson]] claimed there was inadequate control during the séances and the precautions described did not rule out trickery. Hodgson wrote all the phenomena "described could be account for on the assumption that Eusapia could get a hand or foot free." Lodge, Myers and Richet disagreed, but Hodgson was later proven correct in the Cambridge sittings as Palladino was observed to have used tricks exactly the way he had described them.<ref name="Mann1919"/>

In July 1895, Eusapia Palladino was invited to [[England]] to Myers' house in [[Cambridge]] for a series of investigations into her [[mediumship]].  According to reports by the investigators Myers and [[Oliver Lodge]], all the phenomena observed in the Cambridge sittings were the result of trickery. Her fraud was so clever, according to Myers, that it "must have needed long practice to bring it to its present level of skill."<ref name="McCabe1920">[[Joseph McCabe|McCabe, Joseph]]. (1920). [https://archive.org/stream/isspiritualismba00mccarich#page/14/mode/2up ''Is Spiritualism Based on Fraud?: The Evidence Given by Sir A.C. Doyle and Others'']. London, Watts & Co. p. 14</ref>

In the Cambridge sittings the results proved disastrous for her mediumship. During the séances Palladino was caught cheating in order to free herself from the physical controls of the experiments.<ref name="Mann1919"/> Palladino was found liberating her hands by placing the hand of the controller on her left on top of the hand of the controller on her right. Instead of maintaining any contact with her, the observers on either side were found to be holding each other's hands and this made it possible for her to perform tricks.<ref name="Brower 2001">Brower, M. Brady. (2010). ''Unruly Spirits: The Science of Psychic Phenomena in Modern France''. University of Illinois Press. p. 62. {{ISBN|978-0-252-03564-7}}</ref> [[Richard Hodgson (parapsychologist)|Richard Hodgson]] had observed Palladino free a hand to move objects and use her feet to kick pieces of furniture in the room. Because of the discovery of fraud, the British SPR investigators such as [[Henry Sidgwick]] and [[Frank Podmore]] considered Palladino's mediumship to be permanently discredited and because of her fraud she was banned from any further experiments with the SPR in Britain.<ref name="Brower 2001"/>

In the ''[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'' on 9 November 1895 an article was published titled ''Exit Eusapia!''. The article questioned the scientific legitimacy of the [[Society for Psychical Research|SPR]] for investigating Palladino a medium who had a reputation of being a fraud and imposture.<ref name="BMJ1">{{cite journal|date=9 November 1895|volume= 2|issue=1819|pages=1182|journal=The British Medical Journal|title=Exit Eusapia!|pmc=2509128}}</ref> Part of the article read "It would be comic if it were not deplorable to picture this sorry Egeria surrounded by men like Professor Sidgwick, Professor Lodge, Mr. F. H. Myers, Dr. Schiaparelli, and Professor Richet, solemnly receiving her pinches and kicks, her finger skiddings, her sleight of hand with various articles of furniture as phenomena calling for serious study."<ref name="BMJ1"/> This caused [[Henry Sidgwick]] to respond in a published letter to the ''British Medical Journal'', 16 November 1895. According to Sidgwick SPR members had exposed the fraud of Palladino at the Cambridge sittings, Sidgwick wrote "Throughout this period we have continually combated and exposed the frauds of professional mediums, and have never yet published in our Proceedings, any report in favour of the performances of any of them."<ref name="BMJ2">{{cite journal|author=Sidgwick, Henry |date=16 November 1895|volume= 2|issue=1820|pages= 1263–1264|journal=The British Medical Journal|title=Exit Eusapia|pmc=2509272|doi=10.1136/bmj.2.1820.1263-e}}</ref> The response from the Journal questioned why the SPR wastes time investigating phenomena that are the "result of jugglery and imposture" and not urgently concerning the welfare of mankind.<ref name="BMJ2"/>

In 1898, Myers was invited to a series of séances in Paris with Richet. In contrast to the previous séances in which he had observed fraud he claimed to have observed convincing phenomena.<ref name="Oppenheim1985">Oppenheim, Janet (1985). ''The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850–1914''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 150–151. {{ISBN|978-0521265058}}</ref> Sidgwick reminded Myers of Palladino's trickery in the previous investigations as "overwhelming" but Myers did not change his position. This enraged [[Richard Hodgson (parapsychologist)|Richard Hodgson]], then editor of SPR publications to ban Myers from publishing anything on his recent sittings with Palladino in the SPR journal. Hodgson was convinced Palladino was a fraud and supported Sidgwick in the "attempt to put that vulgar cheat Eusapia beyond the pale."<ref name="Oppenheim1985"/> It wasn't until the 1908 sittings in Naples that the SPR reopened the Palladino file.<ref>[[Massimo Polidoro|Polidoro, Massimo]]. (2003). ''Secrets of the Psychics: Investigating Paranormal Claims''. Prometheus Books. p. 61. {{ISBN|978-1591020868}}</ref>

==Eugenics and racial beliefs==
Richet was a proponent of [[eugenics]], advocating [[Sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]] and marriage prohibition for those with mental disabilities.<ref>Cassata, Francesco. (2011). ''Building the New Man: Eugenics, Racial Sciences and Genetics in Twentieth-Century Italy''. Central European University Press. p. 73. {{ISBN|978-963-9776-83-8}}</ref> He expressed his eugenist ideas in his 1919 book ''La Sélection Humaine''.<ref>Mazliak, Laurent; Tazzioli, Rossana. (2009). ''Mathematicians at War: Volterra and His French Colleagues in World War I''. Springer. p. 42. {{ISBN|978-90-481-2739-9}}</ref> From 1920 to 1926 he presided over the French Eugenics Society.<ref>MacKellar, Calum;  Bechtel, Christopher. (2014). ''The Ethics of the New Eugenics''. Berghahn Books. pp. 18–19. {{ISBN|978-1-78238-120-4}}</ref>

Psychologist [[Gustav Jahoda]] has noted that Richet "was a firm believer in the inferiority of blacks",<ref>Gustav Jahoda. (1999). ''Images of Savages: Ancient Roots of Modern Prejudice in Western Culture''. Routledge. p. 154. {{ISBN|978-0-415-18855-5}}</ref> comparing [[black people]] to apes, and intellectually to [[Intellectual disability|imbeciles]].<ref>Bain, Paul G; Vaes, Jeroen; Leyens, Jacques Philippe.
