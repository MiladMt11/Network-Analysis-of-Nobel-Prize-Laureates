Steitz was awarded the 2009 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] along with [[Venkatraman Ramakrishnan]] and [[Ada Yonath]] "for studies of the structure and function of the ribosome".<ref name="2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry">[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2009/ 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry], Nobel Foundation.</ref>  Steitz also won the Gairdner International Award in 2007<ref name="Tom Steitz">[http://steitzlab.yale.edu/people/thomas-steitz Thomas Steitz], Thomas Steitz Lab.</ref> "for his studies on the structure and function of the [[ribosome]] which showed that the [[peptide|peptidyl]] [[transferase]] was an [[RNA]] catalyzed reaction, and for revealing the mechanism of inhibition of this function by [[antibiotics]]".<ref>[http://www.gairdner.org/awards/awardees2/20071998/2007awarde/thomasaste Thomas A. Steitz], The Gairdner 50 Foundation.</ref>

==Education and career==
Born in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]],<ref name="2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry"/> Steitz studied chemistry as an undergraduate at [[Lawrence University]] in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], graduating in 1962. While there he was a member of the fraternity, [[Delta Tau Delta]], the Delta Nu chapter.  In June 2010, the University renamed its chemistry building Thomas A. Steitz Hall of Science.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lawrence To Honor Nobel Prize Winner with Building Renaming Ceremony on Friday |url=http://blogs.lawrence.edu/news/2010/06/lawrence_to_honor_nobel_prize_.html|publisher=Lawrence University|date=9 June 2010|access-date=12 January 2013}}</ref>

He received a Ph.D. in biochemistry and molecular biology from [[Harvard University]] in 1966 where he worked under the direction of subsequent 1976 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|chemistry Nobel Prize]] winner [[William Lipscomb|William N. Lipscomb, Jr.]]
While at Harvard, after the training task of determining the structure of the small molecule methyl ethylene phosphate,<ref name=Steitz1965MEPhosphate/> Steitz made contributions to determining the atomic structures of [[carboxypeptidase A]]<ref name=Hartsuck1965CPA/><ref name=Lipscomb1965CPA/><ref name=Ludwig1966CPA/><ref name=Ludwig1967CPA/><ref name=Reeke1967CPA/><ref name=Lipscomb1967CPA/><ref name=Lipscomb1968CPA/><ref name=Copolla1968CPA/> and [[aspartate carbamoyltransferase]],<ref name=Steitz1967ACTase/> each the largest atomic structure determined in its time.

Steitz did postdoctoral research as a Jane Coffin Childs Postdoctoral Fellow at the MRC [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] during 1967–1970.

Steitz was initially offered an assistant professorship at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], but did not accept, on the grounds that the institution would not accept his wife Joan into a faculty position because she was a woman.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ferry|first=Georgina|date=2018-10-30|title=Thomas A. Steitz (1940–2018)|journal=Nature|language=EN|volume=563|issue=7729|pages=36|doi=10.1038/d41586-018-07187-2|issn=0028-0836|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Both Tom and Joan Steitz instead joined the Yale faculty in 1970, where he continued to work on cellular and structural biology. Steitz and [[Peter Moore (chemist)|Peter Moore]] determined the atomic structure of the large [[50S]] ribosomal subunit using [[X-ray crystallography]], and published their findings in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 2000.<ref>{{cite news |title=Yale Researches Solve Structure of the Ribosome; Groundbreaking Achievement 'Like Climbing Mount Everest' |newspaper=YaleNews |date=10 August 2000 |url=http://news.yale.edu/2000/08/10/yale-researchers-solve-structure-ribosome-groundbreaking-achievement-climbing-mount-evere |access-date=17 March 2015}}</ref> In 2009, Steitz was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his ribosome research.

He was also a Macy Fellow at the [[University of Göttingen]] during 1976–1977 and a Fairchild Scholar at the [[California Institute of Technology]] during 1984-1985.<ref name="Tom Steitz"/>

Steitz was also one of the founders of a company, Rib-X Pharmaceuticals, now [[Melinta Therapeutics]] for the development of new antibiotics based on the ribosome.

==Honors==
* [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] (2009)
* Elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 2011|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 2011]]<ref name=frs>{{cite web | url = http://royalsociety.org/about-us/fellowship/foreign-members/| title = Foreign Members|publisher= [[Royal Society]]|access-date = 2012-03-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramakrishnan|first=V.|last2=Henderson|first2=Richard|date=2021|title=Thomas Arthur Steitz. 23 August 1940—9 October 2018|url=https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbm.2021.0029|journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society|volume=72}}</ref>

==Private life==
He enjoyed [[skiing]], [[hiking]], and [[gardening]].<ref>{{cite book|chapter=''The Best Job Ever.

{{blockquote|It should also be noted that Tom valued a good time. He always looked forward to department happy hours, wine tastings and any other excuse for a party. He hosted many wonderful Halloween parties at his home, always appropriately attire in costume.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=''The Best Job Ever.

Steitz was married to [[Joan Steitz|Joan A. Steitz]], a distinguished molecular biologist who is also a Sterling Professor of Molecular Biophysics and Biochemistry at Yale. He lived with her in [[Branford, Connecticut]] and had one son, Jon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.miptalk.com/thomas-steitz/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-04-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401101355/http://www.miptalk.com/thomas-steitz/ |archive-date=2011-04-01 }}</ref> He died on October 9, 2018 of complications during treatment of pancreatic cancer.
