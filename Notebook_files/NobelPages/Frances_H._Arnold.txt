The same independence that drove Arnold to move out of her childhood home as a teenager also led to a large volume of absences from school and low grades. In spite of this, she made near perfect scores on standardized tests and was determined to attend Princeton University, the alma mater of her father. She applied as a mechanical engineering major and was accepted.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|title=Meet Frances Arnold, Teenage Rebel Turned Nobel Laureate {{!}} College of Chemistry|url=https://chemistry.berkeley.edu/news/meet-frances-arnold-teenage-rebel-turned-nobel-laureate|access-date=2020-10-30|website=chemistry.berkeley.edu}}</ref> Arnold's motivation behind studying engineering, as stated in her Nobel Prize interview, was that "[mechanical engineering] was the easiest option and the easiest way to get into Princeton University at the time and I never left".<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2018|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2018/arnold/interview/|access-date=2020-10-30|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US}}</ref>

In January 2021 she was named an external co-chair of President Joe Biden's [[President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology|Council of Advisors on Science and Technology]] (PCAST). She is working with Biden’s transition team to help identify scientists for roles in the administration. She says her main job now is to help choose PCAST’s additional members and to get to work setting a scientific agenda for the group. She has stated: “We have to reestablish the importance of science in policymaking, in decision making across the government. We need to reestablish the trust of the American people in science ... I think that PCAST can play a beneficial role in that.”<ref>{{Cite web|title=Eric Lander will be Biden's science adviser, a cabinet-level position for the first time|url=https://cen.acs.org/policy/Eric-Lander-will-be-Biden-science-adviser-a-cabinet-level-position-for-the-first-time/99/i3|access-date=2021-01-30|website=cen.acs.org}}</ref> 

===Research===
Arnold is credited with pioneering the use of [[directed evolution]] to create [[enzyme]]s (biochemical molecules—often proteins—that [[Catalysis|catalyze]], or speed up, chemical reactions) with improved and/or novel functions.<ref name="TNP">{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2018 |url=https://old.nobelprize.org/che-press.pdf?_ga=2.87232604.535716584.1538560295-715396971.1538560295 |publisher=The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences |access-date=October 3, 2018}}</ref> The [[directed evolution]] strategy involves iterative rounds of mutagenesis and screening for proteins with improved functions and it has been used to create useful [[biological system]]s, including [[enzyme]]s, [[metabolic pathway]]s, [[genetic regulatory circuit]]s, and organisms. In nature, evolution by [[natural selection]] can lead to proteins (including enzymes) well-suited to carry out biological tasks, but natural selection can only act on existing sequence variations (mutations) and typically occurs over long time periods.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Cirino|first1=Patrick C.|pages=215–243|publisher=Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA|isbn=978-3-527-30423-3|last2=Arnold|first2=Frances H.|doi=10.1002/3527600647.ch10|title=Directed Molecular Evolution of Proteins|year=2002}}</ref> Arnold speeds up the process by introducing mutations in the underlying sequences of proteins; she then tests these mutations' effects. If a mutation improves the proteins' function she can keep iterating the process to optimize it further. This strategy has broad implications because it can be used to design proteins for a wide variety of applications.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=October 3, 2018|title=Scientific Background on the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2018|url=https://old.nobelprize.org/che-sci.pdf?_ga=2.228216788.850160180.1538560699-1556534510.1538560699|journal=Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences}}</ref> For example, she has used directed evolution to design enzymes that can be used to produce [[renewable fuels]] and pharmaceutical compounds with less harm to the environment.<ref name="TNP" />

One advantage of directed evolution is that the mutations do not have to be completely random; instead, they can be random enough to discover unexplored potential, but not so random as to be inefficient. The number of possible mutation combinations is astronomical, but instead of just randomly trying to test as many as possible, she integrates her knowledge of biochemistry to narrow down the options, focusing on introducing mutations in areas of the protein that are likely to have the most positive effect on activity and avoiding areas in which mutations would likely be, at best, neutral and at worst, detrimental (such as disrupting proper protein folding).<ref name="TNP" /> 

Arnold applied directed evolution to the optimization of enzymes (although not the first person to do so, see e.g. Barry Hall<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Barry G.|date=1978|title=Experimental Evolution of a New Enzymatic Function. II. Evolution of Multiple Functions for EBG Enzyme in E. coli|journal=Genetics|volume=89|issue=3|pages=453–465|doi=10.1093/genetics/89.3.453|pmid=97169|pmc=1213848}}</ref>). In<ref name="TNP" /> her seminal work, published in 1993, she used the method to engineer a version of [[subtilisin]] E that was active in the organic solvent [[Dimethylformamide|DMF]], a highly unnatural environment.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=K.|last2=Arnold|first2=F.

After each round she screened the enzymes for their ability to [[Hydrolysis|hydrolyze]] the milk protein [[casein]] in the presence of DMF by growing the bacteria on agar plates containing casein and DMF. The bacteria secreted the enzyme and, if it were functional, it would hydrolyze the casein and produce a visible halo. She selected the bacteria that had the biggest halos and isolated their DNA for further rounds of mutagenesis.<ref name="TNP" /> Using this method, she designed an enzyme that had 256 times more activity in DMF than the original.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Fernholm|first=Ann|date=October 3, 2018|title=A (r)evolution in chemistry|url=https://old.nobelprize.org/che-popular.pdf|journal=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2018: Popular Science Background}}</ref>

She has further developed her methods and applied them under different selection criteria in order to optimize enzymes for different functions. She showed that, whereas naturally evolved enzymes tend to function well at a narrow temperature range, enzymes could be produced using directed evolution that could function at both high and low temperatures.<ref name="TNP" /> In addition to improving the existing functions of natural enzymes, Arnold has designed enzymes that perform functions for which no previous specific enzyme existed, such as when she evolved [[cytochrome P450]] to carry out [[cyclopropanation]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Coelho|first1=Pedro S.|last2=Brustad|first2=Eric M.|last3=Kannan|first3=Arvind|last4=Arnold|first4=Frances H.|s2cid=43145662|date=2013-01-18|title=Olefin cyclopropanation via carbene transfer catalyzed by engineered cytochrome P450 enzymes|journal=Science |volume=339|issue=6117|pages=307–310|doi=10.1126/science.1231434|issn=1095-9203|pmid=23258409|bibcode=2013Sci...339..307C|url=https://authors.library.caltech.edu/36827/7/Coelho.SM.pdf}}</ref> and [[carbene]] and [[nitrene]] transfer reactions.<ref name="TNP" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Prier|first1=Christopher K.|last2=Hyster|first2=Todd K.|last3=Farwell|first3=Christopher C.|last4=Huang|first4=Audrey|last5=Arnold|first5=Frances H.|date=2016-04-04|title=Asymmetric Enzymatic Synthesis of Allylic Amines: A Sigmatropic Rearrangement Strategy|journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition in English|volume=55|issue=15|pages=4711–4715|doi=10.1002/anie.201601056|issn=1521-3773|pmc=4818679|pmid=26970325}}</ref>

In addition to evolving individual molecules, she has used directed evolution to co-evolve enzymes in biosynthetic pathways, such as those involved in the production of [[carotenoid]]s<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Schmidt-Dannert|first1=C.|last2=Umeno|first2=D.|last3=Arnold|first3=F.

For example, she evolved bacteria to produce the biofuel [[isobutanol]]; it can be produced in ''E. coli'' bacteria, but the production pathway requires the [[Cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADPH]], whereas E. coli makes the cofactor [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide|NADH]]. To circumvent this problem, she evolved the enzymes in the pathway to use NADH instead of NADPH, allowing for the production of isobutanol.<ref name="TNP" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Bastian|first1=Sabine|last2=Liu|first2=Xiang|last3=Meyerowitz|first3=Joseph T.|last4=Snow|first4=Christopher D.|last5=Chen|first5=Mike M.

Arnold has also used directed evolution to design highly specific and efficient enzymes that can be used as environmentally-friendly alternatives to some industrial chemical synthesis procedures.<ref name="TNP" /> She, and others using her methods, have engineered enzymes that can carry out synthesis reactions more quickly, with fewer by-products, and in some cases eliminating the need for hazardous [[heavy metals]].<ref name=":0" /> 

She uses structure-guided protein recombination to combine parts of different proteins to form protein chimeras with unique functions. She developed computational methods, such as [[SCHEMA (bioinformatics)|SCHEMA]], to predict how the parts can be combined without disrupting their parental structure, so that the chimeras will fold properly, and then applies directed evolution to further mutate the chimeras to optimize their functions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cheme.che.caltech.edu/groups/fha/Projects2.htm|title=Structure-guided protein recombination|website=The Frances H.

At Caltech, Arnold runs a laboratory that continues to study directed evolution and its applications in environmentally-friendly chemical synthesis and green/alternative energy, including the development of highly active enzymes (cellulolytic and biosynthetic enzymes) and microorganisms to convert renewable biomass to fuels and chemicals.  A paper published in Science in 2019, with Inha Cho and Zhi-Jun Jia, has been retracted on January 2, 2020, as the results were found to be not reproducible.<ref>{{cite news |title=Nobel Prize-winning scientist retracts paper |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-50989423 |access-date=6 January 2020 |work=BBC News |date=3 January 2020}}</ref>

{{As of|2021}}, Arnold has an [[h-index]] of 135 according to [[Google Scholar]].<ref>{{Google Scholar id}}</ref>
