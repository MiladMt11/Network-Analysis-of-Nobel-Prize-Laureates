==Early life (1944–1976)==
Maguire was born into a Roman Catholic community in [[Belfast, Northern Ireland]], the second of eight children – five sisters and two brothers. Her parents were Andrew and Margaret Corrigan.<ref name="nobelcv" /><ref>{{cite book|title=The International Who's Who, 2004|year=2003|publisher=[[Europa Publications]]|location=London|isbn=1-85743-217-7|pages=359|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=neKm1X6YPY0C|edition=67|editor=Elizabeth Sleeman|access-date=22 March 2011|quote=CORRIGAN-MAGUIRE, Mairead; Northern Irish human rights activist; b. 27 Jan. 1944, Belfast; d. of Andrew Corrigan and Margaret Corrigan.}}</ref> She attended St. Vincent's Primary School, a private Catholic school, until the age of 14, at which time her family could no longer pay for her schooling. After working for a time as a babysitter at a Catholic community centre, she was able to save enough money to enrol in a year of business classes at Miss Gordon's Commercial College, which led her at the age of 16 to a job as an accounting clerk with a local factory. She volunteered regularly with the [[Legion of Mary]], spending her evenings and weekends working with children and visiting inmates at [[Maze (HM Prison)|Long Kesh]] prison. When she was 21 she began working as a secretary for the [[Guinness]] brewery, where she remained employed until December 1976.<ref>{{cite book |last=Darraj |first=Susan Muaddi |title=Mairead Corrigan and Betty Williams: Partners for Peace in Northern Ireland |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QeGYg9BMK3EC |publisher=Infobase Publishing |series=Modern Peacmakers |year=2006 |page=45|isbn=978-1-4381-0446-1 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Deutsch |first=Richard |title=Mairead Corrigan, Betty Williams |url=https://archive.org/details/maireadcorriganb00deut |url-access=registration |publisher=Barron's |year=1977 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/maireadcorriganb00deut/page/27 27]–31|isbn=978-0-8120-5268-8 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Peace: Nobel Lectures|year=1997|publisher=[[World Scientific]]|location=Singapore|isbn=981-02-1178-3|pages=149|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nz-HDhb5KO0C|author=Tore Frängsmyr|author2=Irwin Abrams|quote=Education: St. Vincent's Primary School, Falls Road, Belfast; Miss Gordon's Commercial College.

==Northern Ireland peace movement (1976–1980)==
Maguire became active with the Northern Ireland peace movement after three children of her sister, Anne Maguire, were run over and killed by a car driven by Danny Lennon, a [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) fugitive who had been fatally shot by [[British Army|British troops]] while trying to make a getaway.

The next march, to the burial sites of the three Maguire children, brought 10,000 Protestant and Catholic women together. The marchers, including Maguire and Williams, were physically attacked by IRA members.

In 2006, Maguire was one of the founders of the [[Nobel Women's Initiative]] along with fellow Peace Prize laureates [[Betty Williams (Nobel laureate)|Betty Williams]], [[Shirin Ebadi]], [[Wangari Maathai]], [[Jody Williams]], and [[Rigoberta Menchú Tum]]. The Initiative describes itself as six women representing North and South America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa who decided to bring together their "extraordinary experiences in a united effort for peace with justice and equality" and "to help strengthen work being done in support of women's rights around the world".<ref>{{cite web |title=About Us |url=http://www.nobelwomensinitiative.org/about-us |publisher=Nobel Women's Initiative |access-date=8 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022225346/http://www.nobelwomensinitiative.org/about-us |archive-date=22 October 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Maguire supported the Occupy movement and has described WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange as "very courageous". She has also praised Chelsea Manning. "I think they've been tremendously courageous in telling the truth", she has said, adding that "the American government and NATO have destroyed Iraq and Afghanistan. Their next targets will be Syria and Iran".<ref name=progressive />

Together with [[Desmond Tutu]] and [[Adolfo Pérez Esquivel]], Maguire published a letter in support of [[Chelsea Manning]], saying:"The words attributed to Manning reveal that he went through a profound moral struggle between the time he enlisted and when he became a [[whistleblower]]. Through his experience in [[Iraq]], he became disturbed by top-level policy that undervalued human life and caused the suffering of innocent civilians and soldiers. Like other courageous whistleblowers, he was driven foremost by a desire to reveal the truth".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.thenation.com/article/171272/nobel-laureates-salute-bradley-manning# |title=Nobel Laureates Salute Bradley Manning |date=14 November 2012 |access-date=15 February 2013|last1=Tutu |first1=Archbishop Desmond |last2=Maguire |first2=Mairead |last3=Esquivel |first3=Adolfo Pérez }}</ref>

Maguire has also earned a degree from the Irish School of Ecumenics at [[Trinity College Dublin]]. She works with various interchurch and interfaith organizations and is a councilor with the International Peace Council. She is also a Patron of the Methodist Theological College, and of the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education.<ref name="nobel women">{{cite web|title=Mairead Maguire-Northern Ireland, 1976|url=http://nobelwomensinitiative.org/meet-the-laureates/mairead-maguire/|publisher=Nobel Women's Initiative|access-date=11 November 2013}}</ref>

===United States===
Mairead Maguire is an outspoken critic of U.S. and British policy in the Middle East, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan. She has also been personally critical of U.S. President Barack Obama's leadership. Her activism in the U.S. has occasionally brought her into confrontations with the law.

After initially accepting an invitation to a 2012 Nobel summit in Chicago, she changed her mind because the event was hosted by the U.S. State Department, "and to me the Nobel Peace laureates should not be hosted by a State Department that is continuing with war, removing basic civil liberties and human rights and international law and then talking about peace to young people. That's a double standard".

Maguire said in a 2013 interview that ever since her 40-day fast and arrest outside the White House in 2003 (see below), "whenever I now come into America, I'm always questioned as to what my background is".<ref name=progressive />

In 2015, Maguire spoke with ''[[Democracy Now]]'' in a sit-down interview titled, "No to Violence, Yes to Dialogue", which included two other Nobel Peace Prize Laureates, [[Jody Williams]] and [[Leymah Gbowee]]. Maguire discussed the desire "to end militarism and war, and to build peace and international law and human rights and democracy".<ref>{{cite web|title=No to Violence, Yes to Dialogue: Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Mairead Maguire on Path to Peace Today|url=https://www.democracynow.org/2015/4/27/no_to_violence_yes_to_dialogue|publisher=Democracy Now|access-date=15 February 2017}}</ref>

====Iraq and Afghanistan====
Mairead Maguire voiced strong opposition to the U.N. [[sanctions against Iraq]], which is alleged by some to have resulted in hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths,<ref name="Michael Powell 1998">{{cite news|author=Michael Powell |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/doc/408416698.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Dec%2017,%201998&author=Michael%20Powell&pub=The%20Washington%20Post&edition=&startpage=E.01&desc=The%20Deaths%20He%20Cannot%20Sanction;%20Ex-U.N.%20Worker%20Details%20Harm%20to%20Iraqi%20Children |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301082833/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/doc/408416698.html?FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Dec%2017,%201998&author=Michael%20Powell&pub=The%20Washington%20Post&edition=&startpage=E.01&desc=The%20Deaths%20He%20Cannot%20Sanction;%20Ex-U.N.%20Worker%20Details%20Harm%20to%20Iraqi%20Children |archive-date=1 March 2014 |title=U.N. worker details harm |work=Washington Post |access-date=22 July 2010 |date=17 December 1998}} [http://www.public.asu.edu/~wellsda/foreignpolicy/Halliday-criticizes-sanctions.html Alt URL]</ref> calling them "unjust and inhuman", "a new kind of bomb", and "even more cruel than weapons".<ref>Abrams (2003), pp. 94, 99.</ref> During a visit to Baghdad with Argentinian colleague [[Adolfo Pérez Esquivel]] in March 1999, Maguire urged then-U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] and British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] to end the bombing of Iraq and to permit the lifting of U.N. sanction. "I have seen children dying with their mothers next to them and not being able to do anything", Maguire said. "They are not soldiers".<ref>{{citation |last=Faleh |first=Waiel |title=Nobel Winners: Give Iraq a Break |agency=Associated Press |date=9 March 1999}}.</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Iraq Peace Plea |url=http://www.peacepeople.com/IraqPeacePlea.htm |publisher=The Peace People |access-date=29 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611163812/http://www.peacepeople.com/IraqPeacePlea.htm |archive-date=11 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In the aftermath of [[al-Qaeda]]'s attacks on the U.S. in September 2001, as it became clear that the U.S. would retaliate and deploy troops in Afghanistan, Maguire campaigned against the impending war. In India she claimed to have marched with "hundreds of thousands of Indian people walking for peace".<ref>Abrams (2003) pp. 95–96</ref> In New York, Maguire was reported to have marched with 10,000 protesters, purportedly including families of 9/11 victims, as U.S. war planes were already en route to strike Taliban targets in Afghanistan.<ref>{{cite web |title=New York City protest opposes war in Afghanistan |url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2001/oct2001/nyc-o12.shtml |work=wsws.org |publisher=World Socialist Web Site |date=12 October 2001 |access-date=30 January 2011|quote=Over 10,000 people turned out in New York City on Sunday, October 7 to oppose the Bush administration's so-called war on terrorism".

In the period leading up to the March [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], Mairead Maguire campaigned vigorously against the anticipated hostilities. Speaking at the 23rd [[War Resisters' International]] Conference in Dublin, Ireland in August 2002, Maguire called on the Irish government to oppose the [[Iraq War]] "in every European and world forum of which they are a part".<ref>{{cite web |title=Peace on the Move |url=http://www3.unesco.org/iycp/uk/uk_nl/nl_uk_ontdit.asp |publisher=UNESCO |access-date=30 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727205441/http://www3.unesco.org/iycp/uk/uk_nl/nl_uk_ontdit.asp |archive-date=27 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Corrigan Maguire |first=Mairead |title=Act to Save the Children of Iraq |url=http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2002/08/00_maguire_children.htm |publisher=Nuclear Age Peace Foundation |date=4 August 2002 |access-date=30 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031223103420/http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2002/08/00_maguire_children.htm |archive-date=23 December 2003 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> On 17 March 2003, St. Patrick's Day, Maguire protested the war outside the United Nations Headquarters with, among other activists, [[Frida Berrigan]]. On 19 March, Maguire addressed an audience of 300 people in a chapel at Le Moyne College in Syracuse, N.Y. "Armies with all their advanced [[weapons of mass destruction]] are facing the Iraqi people who have nothing", she told the crowd. "In anybody's language, it's not fair".<ref>{{cite web |last=Cissel |first=Connie |title=She's a Peacemaker |url=http://www.thecatholicsun.com/2003-archives/page-49 |publisher=The Catholic Sun |date=27 March 2003 |access-date=30 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716225145/http://www.thecatholicsun.com/2003-archives/page-49 |archive-date=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Around this time, Maguire held a 30-day vigil and began a 40-day liquid fast outside the White House, joined by members of [[Pax Christi]] USA and Christian church leaders. As the war got under way in the days that followed, Maguire described the invasion as an "ongoing and shameful slaughter". "Daily we sit, facing Mecca in solidarity with our Muslim brothers and sisters in Iraq, and we ask Allah for forgiveness", she said in a statement to the press on 31 March.<ref>{{cite web |title=War in Iraq and Anti-war Protests |url=http://www.peacepeople.com/USAVigil.htm |publisher=The Peace People |access-date=30 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721030615/http://www.peacepeople.com/USAVigil.htm |archive-date=21 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Abrams (2003) p. 97</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mairead Corrigan Maguire |url=http://www.paxchristi.org.uk/PeacePeople/Corrigan.pdf |publisher=Pax Christi |access-date=30 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721103815/http://www.paxchristi.org.uk/PeacePeople/Corrigan.pdf |archive-date=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Maguire would later remark that the media in the U.S. distorted news from Iraq and that the Iraq War was carried out in pursuit of American "economic and military interests".<ref>Abrams (2003) pp. 96–97</ref> In February 2006 she expressed her belief that [[George W.

====Criticism of President Barack Obama====
Maguire expressed disappointment with the selection of U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] as winner of the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize. "They say this is for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between peoples", she said, "and yet he continues the policy of militarism and occupation of Afghanistan, instead of dialogue and negotiations with all the parties to the conflict. [...] Giving this award to the leader of the most militarised country in the world, which has taken the human family against its will to war, will rightly be seen by many people around the world as a reward for his country's aggression and domination".<ref>{{cite web |title=Nobel Peace Laureate: Obama Choice 'Disappointing' |url=http://www.accuracy.org/newsrelease.php?articleId=2095 |publisher=[[Institute for Public Accuracy]] |date=9 October 2009 |access-date=9 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023052433/http://accuracy.org/newsrelease.php?articleId=2095 |archive-date=23 October 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Maguire condemned what she considered Obama's deliberate refusal to meet with the Dalai Lama, calling it "horrifying".<ref>{{cite web |last=Devraj |first=Ranjit |title=Rising China Poses Danger to Peace, Say Nobel Laureates |url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49087 |publisher=Inter Press Service (IPS) |date=31 October 2009 |access-date=30 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612142529/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=49087 |archive-date=12 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Speaking at the [[Carl von Ossietzky Medal]] Award Ceremony in Berlin in December 2010, Maguire imputed criminal accountability to President Obama for violation of international law. "When President Obama says he wants to see a world without nuclear weapons and says, in respect of Iran and their alleged nuclear weapons ambitions, that 'all option {{sic|date=March 2011}} are on the table,' this is clearly a threat to use nuclear weapons, clearly a criminal threat against Iran, under the world court advisory opinion. The [[Nuremberg Charter]] of 8 August 1945 says the threat or use of nuclear weapons is criminal, so officials in all nine nuclear weapons states who maintain and use nuclear deterrence as a threat are committing crimes and breaking international law".<ref>{{cite web |title=Speech by Nobel Laureate Mairead Maguire During the Carl-von-Ossietzky Medal Award Ceremony Berlin 12th December 2010 |url=http://www.nobelforpeace-summits.org/speech-by-nobel-laureate-mairead-maguire-during-the-carl-von-ossietzky-medal-award-ceremony-berlin-12th-december-2010/ |publisher=World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates |access-date=30 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110114222450/http://www.nobelforpeace-summits.org/speech-by-nobel-laureate-mairead-maguire-during-the-carl-von-ossietzky-medal-award-ceremony-berlin-12th-december-2010/ |archive-date=14 January 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

====Confrontations with the law====
Mairead Maguire was twice arrested in the United States. On 17 March 2003, she was arrested outside the United Nations headquarters in New York City during a protest against the Iraq War. Later that month, on 27 March, she was one of 65 anti-war protesters briefly taken into custody by police after penetrating a security barricade near the White House.<ref>{{cite web |title=Protest Arrests Include Nobel Winners, Ellsberg |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/mar/27/news/war-briefs27.2 |work=The Los Angeles Times |date=27 March 2003 |access-date=14 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=War on Iraq and Anti-war Protests |url=http://www.peacepeople.com/USAVigil.htm |publisher=The Peace People |date=3 April 2003 |access-date=31 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721030615/http://www.peacepeople.com/USAVigil.htm |archive-date=21 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In May 2009, following a visit to Guatemala, immigration authorities at the Houston Airport in Texas detained Maguire for a number of hours, during which time she was questioned, fingerprinted and photographed, and consequently missed her connecting flight to Northern Ireland. "They insisted I must tick the box in the Immigration form admitting to criminal activities," she explained.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nobel Peace Laureate Mairead Maguire Detained by USA Homeland Security |url=http://www.nobelwomensinitiative.org/images/stories/Mairead_Maguire_Detained.pdf |publisher=Nobel Women's Initiative |access-date=31 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110223234424/http://www.nobelwomensinitiative.org/images/stories/Mairead_Maguire_Detained.pdf |archive-date=23 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In late July that same year, Maguire was again detained by immigration authorities, this time at the Dulles International Airport in Virginia, on her way from Ireland to New Mexico to meet with colleague [[Jody Williams]].

===Israel===

Mairead Maguire first visited Israel at age 40 in 1984. She came then as part of an interfaith initiative seeking forgiveness from Jews for years of persecution by Christians in Jesus' name. Her second visit was in June 2000, this time in response to invitations from [[Rabbis for Human Rights]] and the [[Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions]]. The two groups had taken upon themselves to defend Ahmed Shamasneh in an Israeli military court against charges of illegally constructing his home in the West Bank town of [[Qatanna]], and Maguire traveled to Israel to observe the court proceedings and support the Shamasneh family.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.interfaithstudies.org/peace/maguire.html |title=From Northern Ireland to Israel and Palestine |first=Eeta |last=Prince-Gibson |year=2000 |work=Jerusalem Post (via peacecouncil.org) |access-date=6 February 2011 |quote=Two weeks ago, Maíread Maguire, 1976 Nobel Peace Prize laureate from Northern Ireland, visited Israel and the Palestinian Territories as a representative of the Peace Council.

It was Maguire's second trip to Israel. Ten years ago, she came to fast and pray in repentance for what Christians have done to Jews in Jesus's name. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725012218/http://www.interfaithstudies.org/peace/maguire.html |archive-date=25 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peacecouncil.org/israel_news.html |title=&#91;From ''Report from the Peace Council'', Fall, 2000&#93; |year=2000 |publisher=International Committee for the Peace Council |access-date=6 February 2011 |quote=On very short notice Peace Councilor Máiread Maguire agreed to attend the June, 2000 trial in an Israeli military court of Ahmed (Abu Faiz) Shamasneh, a Palestinian grandfather accused of illegally building a home for his family, and the result was a flood of stories in Israeli, Palestinian, and European newspapers, television, and radio about the case and about the plight of Palestinians who are not able to provide legal housing for their families. [The photo shows Máiread Maguire being briefed by Phil Halper of the Israeli Committee Against Home Demolitions. Eetta Prince-Gibson, author of the following article, is in the foreground.]}}</ref>

In a 2013 interview, she omitted any mention of her 1984 trip to Israel, saying that "I first went to Israel/Palestine at the invitation of Rabbis for Human Rights and the Israeli Committee against House Demolitions" and "was absolutely horrified" at Palestinians' living conditions. It was after that visit that she "started going on a regular basis" because she was "very hopeful that there is a solution to the Israeli/Palestinian injustice. In Northern Ireland, people said there would never be a solution. But once people begin to have the political will and force their governments to sit down, it can happen".<ref name=progressive />

A 2013 profile of Maguire in The Progressive noted that "she hasn't lost her passion yet" and that "it is the Israeli occupation of Palestine that has occupied much of her attention in recent years".<ref name= progressive />

====Mordechai Vanunu advocacy====
Mairead Maguire has been a vocal supporter of [[Mordechai Vanunu]], a former Israeli nuclear technician who revealed details of Israel's nuclear defence program to the British press in 1986 and subsequently served 18 years in prison for treason.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/apr/21/israel3 |title=Vanunu released after 18 years |date=21 April 2004 |work=The Guardian |access-date=22 February 2011 |quote=Among Mr Vanunu's supporters were British actress Susannah York and Nobel peace prize laureate Mairead Corrigan Maguire of Northern Ireland.}}</ref> Maguire flew to Israel in April 2004 to greet Vanunu upon his release<ref>{{cite web |title=Israel frees nuclear whistleblower Vanunu |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2004-04-21-israeli-spy-released_x.htm |work=[[USA Today]] (AP) |date=21 April 2004 |access-date=8 July 2009}}</ref> and has since flown to meet with him in Israel on several occasions.

Maguire has described as "draconian" the terms of Vanunu's parole – including a special order prohibiting contact with foreign journalists and a refusal to allow him to leave Israel – and said he "remains a virtual prisoner".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/maguire09162006.html |title=A Visit with Mordechai Vanunu |first=Mairead |last=Corrigan Maguire |date=16–17 September 2006 |publisher=counterpunch |access-date=22 February 2011 |quote=Upon his release, the Israeli Government imposed draconian restrictions on his freedom. He is forbidden to speak to foreigners or to foreign press or to leave Israel. Each year for the past two years, on the 21st of April, these restrictions have been renewed and Vanunu remains a virtual prisoner, living within a couple of square miles of East Jerusalem and under constant security surveillance everywhere he goes. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317171909/http://www.counterpunch.org/maguire09162006.html |archive-date=17 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In an open letter addressed to the Israeli people in July 2010, after Vanunu was returned to prison for violating the terms of his parole, Maguire urged Jews in Israel to petition their government for Vanunu's release and freedom. She praised Vanunu as "a man of peace", "a great visionary", "a true Gandhian spirit" and compared his actions to those of [[Alfred Nobel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peacepeople.com/dynamic_news.php?id=27 |title=An Open Letter to the People of Israel about Mordechai Vanunu |first=Mairead |last=Maguire |date=14 July 2010 |publisher=Peace People |access-date=22 February 2011 |quote=I have met Mordechai many times since he was released from prison on 21st April, 2004.

====References to the Holocaust====
At a joint press conference with Mordechai Vanunu in Jerusalem in December 2004, Maguire compared Israel's nuclear weapons to the Nazi gas chambers in [[Auschwitz]]. "When I think about nuclear weapons, I've been to Auschwitz concentration camp". She added, "Nuclear weapons are only gas chambers perfected ... and for a people who already know what gas chambers are, how can you even think of building perfect gas chambers".<ref>{{cite news |title=Nobel laureate compares Israeli nuclear arms to gas chambers |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/nobel-laureate-compares-israeli-nuclear-arms-to-gas-chambers-1.144503 |work=Haaretz |agency=AP |date=19 December 2004 |access-date=1 July 2010}}</ref>

In January 2006, close to [[Holocaust Memorial Day]], Maguire asked that Mordechai Vanunu be remembered together with the Jews that perished in the Holocaust. "As we, with sorrow and sadness, remember the Holocaust Victims, we remember too those individuals of conscience who refused to be silenced in the face of danger and paid with their freedom and lives in defending their Jewish brothers and sisters, and we remember our brother Mordechai Vanunu – the lonely Israeli prisoner in his own country, who refused to be silent".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2006/01/00_maguire_lonely-israeli-prisoner.htm |title=The Lonely Israeli Prisoner – Mordechai Vanunu |first=Mairead |last=Maguire |date=January 2006 |publisher=Nuclear Age Peace Foundation |access-date=22 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202181706/http://wagingpeace.org/articles/2006/01/00_maguire_lonely-israeli-prisoner.htm |archive-date=2 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In a speech delivered in February 2006 to the [[Nuclear Age Peace Foundation]] in Santa Barbara, California, Maguire again made a comparison between nuclear weapons and the Nazis. "Last April some of us protested at Dimona Nuclear Plant, in Israel, calling for it to be open to UN Inspection, and bombs to be destroyed. Israeli Jets flew overhead, and a train passed into the Dimona nuclear site. This brought back to me vivid memories of my visit to Auschwitz concentration camp, with its rail tracks, trains, destruction and death".<ref>{{cite web |title=Nobel Women's Initiative – a Right to Live without Violence, Nuclear Weapons and War |url=http://www.nobelwomensinitiative.org/about-us/laureates/article/a-right-to-live-without-violence-nuclear-weapons-and-war |publisher=Nobelwomensinitiative.org |date=21 February 2006 |access-date=1 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721000302/http://www.nobelwomensinitiative.org/about-us/laureates/article/a-right-to-live-without-violence-nuclear-weapons-and-war |archive-date=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Maguire firmly denied comparing Israel to Nazi Germany in an interview with Tal Schneider of ''[[Globes (newspaper)|Lady Globes]]'' in November 2010. "I have for years been speaking out against nuclear weapons. I am actively opposed to nuclear weapons in Britain, in the United States, in Israel, in any country, because nuclear weapons are the ultimate destruction of humankind. But I have never said that Israel is like Nazi Germany, and I don't know why I am quoted like that in Israel. I also never compared Gaza to an extermination camp. I visited the death camps in Austria, with Nobel Prize laureate Elie Wiesel, and I think it is terrible that people did not try to stop the genocide of the Jewish people".<ref>{{cite news |script-title=he:כלות פרס נובל: 'ישראל מדינת אפרטהייד, מפעילה טיהור אתני' |first=Tal |last=Schneider |url=http://www.globes.co.il/news/article.aspx?did=1000598551 |newspaper=[[Globes (newspaper)|Lady Globes]] |publisher=[[Globes (newspaper)|Globes]] |date=10 November 2011 |access-date=11 March 2011 |language=he |trans-title=Nobel Prize laureate: 'Israel is an apartheid state, engages in ethnic cleansing' |quote=אני שנים מדברת נגד נשק גרעיני. אני אקטיביסטית נגד נשק גרעיני בבריטניה, בארה"ב, בישראל, בכל מדינה, כי נשק גרעיני הוא ההרס האולטימטיבי של האנושות. אבל אני מעולם לא אמרתי שישראל היא כמו גרמניה הנאצית, ואני לא יודעת למה מצטטים אותי כך בישראל. גם לא השוויתי בין עזה לבין מחנה השמדה. אני ביקרתי במחנות ההשמדה באוסטריה, ביחד עם חתן פרס נובל אלי ויזל, ואני חושבת שזה נורא שאנשים לא ניסו לעצור את רצח העם היהודי.}}</ref>

====Palestinian activism====
Maguire said in a 2007 speech that Israel's separation wall "is a monument to fear and failed politics" and that "for many Palestinians daily living is so hard, it is indeed an act of resistance." She praised the "inspirational work of the International Solidarity Movement" and paid tribute to the memory of "Rachel Corrie, who gave her life protesting the demolition of Palestinian homes by Israeli military", saying that "it is the Rachels of this world who reminds us that we are responsible for each other, and we are interconnected in a mysteriously spiritual and beautiful way".<ref>{{cite web|title=Mairead Corrigan Maguire: Nobel Peace Laureate Shot with Israeli Rubber-coated Steel Bullet |date=26 April 2007|url=http://blog.beliefnet.com/godspolitics/2007/04/mairead-corrigan-maguire-nobel-peace.html|publisher=God's Politics|access-date=25 November 2013}}</ref>

On 20 April 2007, Maguire participated in a protest against the construction of Israel's separation barrier outside the Palestinian village of [[Bil'in]]. The protest was held in a no-access military zone. Israeli forces used tear-gas grenades and rubber-coated bullets in an effort to disperse the protesters, while the protesters hurled rocks at the Israeli troops, injuring two Border Guard policemen. One rubber bullet hit Maguire in the leg, whereupon she was transferred to an Israeli hospital for treatment. She was also reported to have inhaled large quantities of tear gas.<ref>{{cite web |first=Ali |last=Waked |title=Nobel peace laureate Corrigan injured in anti-fence protest |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3390314,00.html |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date=20 April 2007|access-date=8 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |first=Justin |last=Morahan |title=Palestine: IDF Shoots Irish Peace Prize Winner With Rubber Bullets |url=http://www.indymedia.ie/article/82119 |publisher=[[Indymedia Ireland]] |date=23 April 2007 |access-date=8 July 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=End the Occupation Now |first=Mairead |last=Corrigan Maguire |url=http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/04/26/770/ |publisher=[[Common Dreams NewsCenter|Common Dreams]] |date=26 April 2007 |access-date=8 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714080554/http://www.commondreams.org/archive/2007/04/26/770 |archive-date=14 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In October 2008, Maguire arrived in Gaza aboard the SS ''Dignity''. Although Israel had insisted that the yacht would not be permitted to approach Gaza, then-Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] ultimately capitulated and allowed the ship to sail to its destination without incident.<ref>{{cite web |last= Khalil |first=Ashraf |title=Protesters' boat arrives in Gaza |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/30/world/fg-gaza30 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=30 October 2008 |access-date=24 January 2011}}</ref> During her stay in Gaza, Maguire met with [[Hamas]] leader [[Ismail Haniyeh]].

[[File:Huwaida and Mairead on Spirit of Humanity.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Huwaida Arraf and Mairead Maguire aboard the MV Spirit of Humanity, June 2009|[[Huwaida Arraf]] and Maguire, 2009]]
On 30 June 2009, Maguire was taken into custody by the Israeli military along with twenty others, including former U.S. Congresswoman [[Cynthia McKinney]]. She was on board a small ferry, the MV ''Spirit of Humanity'' (formerly the ''Arion''), said to be carrying humanitarian aid to the [[Gaza Strip]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Israel navy intercepts boat with ex-U.S. Rep.

From an Israeli prison, she gave a lengthy interview with [[Democracy Now!]] via cell phone,<ref>{{cite web |title=Nobel Peace Laureate Mairead Maguire Speaks from Israeli Jail Cell After Arrest on Boat Delivering Humanitarian Aid to Gaza |url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/7/2/nobel_peace_laureate_mairead_maguire_speaks |work=[[Democracy Now!]] |date=2 July 2009|access-date=8 July 2009}}</ref> and was deported on 7 July 2009 to Dublin.<ref>{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Jansen |title=Israel deports Nobel laureate |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2009/0707/1224250170719.html |work=The Irish Times |date=7 July 2009 |access-date=8 July 2009}}</ref> on 2 July 2009. In the interview, she rejected Israeli authorities' claim that aid can pass freely into Gaza, charging that "Gaza is like a huge prison...a huge occupied territory of one-and-a-half million people who have been subjected to collective punishment by the Israeli government". She further said that "the tragedy is that the American government, the UN and Europe, they remain silent in the face of the abuse of Palestinian human rights, like freedom, and it's really tragic". In addition, she claimed that when her boat was approached by Israeli naval vessels in international waters, "we were in grave danger of actually being killed at that point....really we were in a very, very dangerous position. So we were literally hijacked, taken at gunpoint by the Israeli military".<ref>{{cite web|title=Nobel Peace Laureate Mairead Maguire Speaks from Israeli Jail Cell After Arrest on Boat Delivering Humanitarian Aid to Gaza|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/7/2/nobel_peace_laureate_mairead_maguire_speaks|publisher=Democracy Now|access-date=25 November 2013|date=2 July 2009}}</ref>

In May–June 2010, Maguire was a passenger on board the [[MV Rachel Corrie|MV ''Rachel Corrie'']], one of seven vessels that were part of the [[Gaza flotilla raid|Gaza Freedom Flotilla]], a flotilla of pro-Palestinian activists that attempted to bust the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of the Gaza Strip. In an interview with BBC Radio Ulster while still at sea, Maguire called the blockade an "inhumane, illegal siege."<ref>{{cite web |title=Irish aid ship expects Israelis to board vessel |publisher=BBC |date=2 June 2010 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10212345 |access-date=29 December 2010}}</ref> Having been delayed due to mechanical problems, the ''Rachel Corrie'' did not actually sail with the flotilla and only approached the Gazan coast several days after the main flotilla did. In contrast with the violence that characterised the arrival of the first six ships, Israel's takeover of the ''Rachel Corrie'' was met only with passive resistance. Israeli naval forces were even lowered a ladder by the passengers to assist their ascent onto the deck.<ref>{{cite web |last=Meranda |first=Amnon |title=Seized ship enters Ashdod Port |publisher=Ynet |date=6 June 2010 |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3899313,00.html |access-date=29 December 2010}}</ref> After the incident, Maguire said she did not feel her life was in danger as the ship's captain, Derek Graham, had been in touch with the Israeli navy to assure them that there would be no violent resistance.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rachel Corrie activists 'relieved' to be home |publisher=RTÉ |date=8 June 2010 |url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2010/0607/rachelcorrie.html |access-date=29 December 2010}}</ref>

On 28 September 2010, Maguire landed in Israel as part of a delegation of the [[Nobel Women's Initiative]]. She was refused an entry visa by Israeli authorities on the grounds that she had twice in the past tried to run Israel's naval embargo of the Gaza Strip and that a 10-year exclusion order was in effect against her.<ref>{{cite news |title=Irish Nobel laureate challenges Israeli detention |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gXp6fvvgQLELYgmlMBK-EaQ8A1WQD9IKDA000?docId=D9IKDA000 |agency=Associated Press |date=3 October 2010 |access-date=7 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Supreme Court rejects Maguire's appeal |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3964109,00.html |publisher=Ynet News |date=4 October 2010 |access-date=7 October 2010}}</ref> She fought her deportation with the help of Adalah an NGHO devoted to the rights of Palestinians in Israel. Fatmeh El-Ajou, an attorney for Adalah noted, "We believe that the decision to refuse entry to Ms. Maguire is based on illegitimate, irrelevant, and arbitrary political considerations".<ref>{{cite web|last=Guarnieri|first=Mya|title=Nobel Peace Prize Winner Detained in Israel|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mya-guarnieri/nobel-peace-prize-winner_b_741692.html|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=27 November 2013|date=28 Sep 2010}}</ref> Her legal team filed a petition against the order with the Central District Court on Maguire's behalf, but the court ruled pronounced that the deportation order was valid. Maguire then appealed to [[Supreme Court of Israel|Israel's Supreme Court]]. Initially, the Court proposed that Maguire be allowed to remain in the country for a few days on bail despite the deportation order; however, the state rejected the proposal, arguing that Maguire had known prior to her arrival she was barred from entering Israel and that her conduct amounted to taking the law into her own hands. A three-judge panel accepted the state's position and upheld the ruling of the Central District Court. At one point during the hearing, Maguire reportedly spoke up, saying that Israel must stop "its apartheid policy and the siege on Gaza". One of the judges scolded her saying, "This is no place for propaganda". Mairead Corrigan-Maguire was deported on a flight to the UK the following morning, 5 October 2010.<ref>{{cite web |title=Irish Nobel winner Maguire boards flight out of Israel |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=190263 |work=[[Jerusalem Post]] |date=5 October 2010 |access-date=7 October 2010}}</ref>

As preparations for a [[Freedom Flotilla II|second Gaza flotilla]] got underway in the summer of 2011, with the Irish MV Saoirse expected to take part, Maguire expressed her support for the campaign and called on Israel to grant the flotilla passengers safe passage to Gaza.<ref>{{cite news|last=Reilly|first=Gavan|title=Nobel laureate appeals for safe passage for Gaza flotilla|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/nobel-laureate-appeals-for-safe-passage-for-gaza-flotilla-163326-Jun2011/|access-date=26 June 2011|newspaper=The Journal.ie|date=25 June 2011|quote=One of Ireland's former Nobel peace laureates has urged the Israeli government not to pursue violence against the people sailing on a second aid flotilla to Gaza at the end of the month.}}</ref>

Maguire said in a December 2011 interview that "Hamas is an elected party and should be recognized as such by all. It has the democratic vote and should be recognised". She pointed out that on her 2008 Gaza trip she had been invited to speak "to the Hamas parliament".<ref>{{cite web|last=Chehata|first=Dr. Hanan|title=Nobel Peace Laureate Mairead Maguire speaks to MEMO about Palestine, political prisoners and nuclear weapons|url=http://www.middleeastmonitor.com/resources/interviews/3126-nobel-peace-laureate-mairead-maguire-speaks-to-memo-about-palestine-political-prisoners-and-nuclear-weapons|work=Middle East Monitor|access-date=25 November 2013|date=1 Dec 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204034601/https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/resources/interviews/3126-nobel-peace-laureate-mairead-maguire-speaks-to-memo-about-palestine-political-prisoners-and-nuclear-weapons|archive-date=4 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
In March 2014, Maguire tried to arrive to Gaza through Egypt, as a part of activist delegation which also included the American anti-war activist [[Medea Benjamin]]. The members of the delegation were arrested in Cairo, questioned and deported.<ref>{{cite news|last=al-Atrush|first=Samer|title=Egypt bars Gaza-bound Irish Nobel Peace Laureate Maguire|url=https://news.yahoo.com/egypt-bars-irish-nobel-peace-laureate-maguire-164535636.html|access-date=13 March 2014|newspaper=Yahoo News|date=5 March 2014}}</ref>

In 2016, Maguire attempted to break Israel's naval blockade of the Gaza Strip along with 13 other activists on board the Women's Boat to Gaza,<ref>{{cite web |title= Participants on Board: Messina to Gaza |url=https://wbg.freedomflotilla.org/participants-on-board-messina-to-gaza |date= 5 October 2016 |access-date=20 February 2020}}</ref> until they were stopped by the [[Israeli Navy]] approximately {{Convert|40|miles|km|abbr=}} offshore. The boat was escorted to the port of Ashdod. The Israeli military said the interception was brief and without injuries. Maguire complained that she and the activists were "arrested, kidnapped, illegally, in international waters and taken against our wishes to Israel".<ref>{{cite web|title=Israel intercepts protest vessel trying to break naval blockade of Gaza|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/israel-intercepts-protest-vessel-trying-to-break-naval-blockade-of-gaza|work=The Guardian|date=5 October 2016|access-date=16 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Nobel peace laureate Mairead Maguire: Israeli forces kidnapped me in international waters|newspaper=Belfasttelegraph|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/nobel-peace-laureate-mairead-maguire-israeli-forces-kidnapped-me-in-international-waters-35110831.html|publisher=Belfast Telegraph|access-date=15 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Young|first1=Connla|title=Nobel peace prize winner Mairead Corrigan 'kidnapped' by Israeli forces|date=6 October 2016|url=http://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2016/10/07/news/nobel-peace-prize-winner-mairead-corrigan-kidnapped-by-israeli-forces-724178/|publisher=The Irish News|access-date=15 February 2017}}</ref>

===Comparison of Palestinians and Israelis===
Maguire has more than once suggested that Palestinians are more interested in peace than the Israeli government. She said in a 2011 interview that when she and some colleagues left Gaza in 2008, "we were very hopeful because there is a passionate desire among the Palestinian people for peace, and then Operation Cast Lead started the following week. That was horrific". Israel, she said, had killed Palestinian farmers and fishermen who were just "trying to fish for their families", thus proving "that the Israeli government does not want peace".<ref>{{cite web|last=Chehata|first=Dr. Hanan|title=Nobel Peace Laureate Mairead Maguire speaks to MEMO about Palestine, political prisoners and nuclear weapons|url=http://www.middleeastmonitor.com/resources/interviews/3126-nobel-peace-laureate-mairead-maguire-speaks-to-memo-about-palestine-political-prisoners-and-nuclear-weapons|publisher=Middle East Monitor|access-date=30 November 2013|date=1 Dec 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204034601/https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/resources/interviews/3126-nobel-peace-laureate-mairead-maguire-speaks-to-memo-about-palestine-political-prisoners-and-nuclear-weapons|archive-date=4 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In a 2013 interview, she repeated the same point, saying that in Gaza in 2008, she had been told by Hamas and Fatah leaders "that they want dialogue and peace", yet a week later "Israel bombed Gaza, committing war crimes", showing "that there is no political will for peace in the Israeli government".<ref name=progressive />

=== Russell Tribunal===
In October 2012, Maguire traveled to New York City to serve on the [[Russell Tribunal]] on Israel/Palestine alongside writer [[Alice Walker]], activist [[Angela Davis]], former Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney, and Pink Floyd's Roger Waters.<ref name=progressive /> During her participation in the Russell Tribunal, Maguire, according to one report, "asked the question that seems to be taboo in the U.S.: Why does President Barack Obama allow Israel to threaten Iran with war when Iran has signed the NPT and Israel has at least 200 nuclear weapons? Why does the president not demand that Israel sign the NPT?"<ref name=russel>{{cite web|last=Adas|first=Jane|title=Russell Tribunal on Palestine Examines Roles of U.N. and U.S.|url=http://www.wrmea.org/wrmea-archives/541-washington-report-archives-2011-2015/january-february-2013/11612-russell-tribunal-on-palestine-examines-roles-of-u-n-and-u-s.html|access-date=30 November 2013|year=2013}}</ref>

After her work on the Russell Tribunal was completed Maguire said that the experience had "opened the mind, and deepened the understanding of all those present to the facts of the ongoing injustice which the Palestinians are daily suffering under Israeli siege and occupation. The RToP's findings and conclusions challenge Governments and civil society to have courage and act by implementing sanctions, BDS etc., thereby refusing to be silent and complicit in the face of Israel's violation of International Laws. The RToP was brilliant, informative and decisive, reminding us that all our Governments, and we the people, have a moral and legal responsibility to act to protect Human Rights and International Law and we cannot be silent when injustice is being done to anyone, anywhere".<ref name=nobel>{{cite web|title=Mairead Maguire, Russell Tribunal on Palestine find Israel guilty of Apartheid|url=http://nobelwomensinitiative.org/2011/11/mairead-maguire-russell-tribunal-on-palestine-find-israel-guilty-of-apartheid/|publisher=Nobel Women's Initiative|access-date=30 November 2013|date=10 Nov 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203012503/http://nobelwomensinitiative.org/2011/11/mairead-maguire-russell-tribunal-on-palestine-find-israel-guilty-of-apartheid/|archive-date=3 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

== Rohingya issue ==

In March 2018, Maguire and two [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] peace laureates [[Shirin Ebadi]] and [[Tawakkol Karman]] visited [[Rohingya conflict|Rohingya]] camps in [[Cox's Bazar District|Cox's Bazar]] and shared opinions on the crisis.

==Personal philosophy and vision==
{{cquote|Gandhi taught that nonviolence does not mean passivity. No. It is the most daring, creative, and courageous way of living, and it is the only hope for our world. Nonviolence is an active way of life which always rejects violence and killing, and instead applies the force of love and truth as a means to transform conflict and the root causes of conflict. Nonviolence demands creativity. It pursues dialogue, seeks reconciliation, listens to the truth in our opponents, rejects militarism, and allows God's spirit to transform us socially and politically.|author=Mairead Maguire|source=[[Santa Clara University]]<ref>[http://www.scu.edu/ethics/architects-of-peace/Maguire/essay.html "Mairead Corrigan Maguire Reflects on Working Toward Peace"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150613203619/http://www.scu.edu/ethics/architects-of-peace/Maguire/essay.html |date=13 June 2015 }}.

Mairead Maguire is a proponent of the belief that violence is a disease that humans develop but are not born with. She believes humankind is moving away from a mindset of violence and war and evolving to a higher consciousness of [[nonviolence]] and love. Among the figures she considers spiritual prophets in this regard are Jesus, [[Francis of Assisi]], Gandhi, [[Khan Abdul Ghaffar Khan]], Fr. John L. McKenzie, and Martin Luther King, Jr.<ref name="journeying">{{cite web |url=http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2006/12/21_maguire_nonviolence.htm |title=Journeying with Active Nonviolence |first=Mairead |last=Corrigan Maguire |date=21 December 2006 |publisher=Nuclear Age Peace Foundation |access-date=20 February 2011 |quote=The good news is that we are not born violent, most humans never kill, and the World Health Organization says Human Violence is a 'preventable disease'. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202175639/http://wagingpeace.org/articles/2006/12/21_maguire_nonviolence.htm |archive-date=2 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wagingpeace.org/articles/2006/11/19_maguire_nonviolentworld.htm |title=A Nonkilling, Nonviolent World for the 21st Century |first=Mairead |last=Corrigan Maguire |date=17 November 2006 |publisher=Nuclear Age Peace Foundation |access-date=19 February 2011 |quote=The Human family is moving away from the violent mindset, and increasingly violence, war, armed struggles, violent revolutions, are no longer romanticed, glorified, or culturally accepted as ways of solving our problems. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202182516/http://wagingpeace.org/articles/2006/11/19_maguire_nonviolentworld.htm |archive-date=2 December 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.peacepeople.com/MaireadByJohnDear.htm |title=Mairead Corrigan Maguire by John Dear, S.J. |publisher=The Peace People |access-date=19 February 2011 |quote=I believe that hope for the future depends on each of us taking nonviolence into our hearts and minds and developing new and imaginative structures which are nonviolent and life-giving for all...Some people will argue that this is too idealistic.

Maguire professes to rejects violence in all its forms. "As a pacifist I believe that violence is never justified, and there are always alternatives to force and threat of force. We must challenge the society that tells us there is no such alternative. In all areas of our lives we should adopt nonviolence, in our lifestyles, our education, our commerce, our defence, and our governance."<ref name="journeying" /> Maguire has called for the abolition of all armies and the establishment of a multi-national community of unarmed peacekeepers in their stead.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vmpeace.org/apiget/pdf/ref/Documents-documents-19-file/Annual%20Erskine%20Childers%20Lecture%202009%20-Mairead%20Maguire%20and%20Vijay%20Mehta |title='Saving Succeeding Generations from the Scourge of War': Building a Nonkilling, Nonviolent Culture for the Human Family |first=Mairead |last=Maguire |date=18 February 2009 |publisher=Mehta Centre |access-date=19 February 2011 |quote=Armies: I believe we should work to transform the culture of militarism into a culture of nonkilling, nonviolence and peace.

===The Vision of Peace: Faith and Hope in Northern Ireland===
Maguire has written a book, ''The Vision of Peace: Faith and Hope in Northern Ireland.''<ref name=nwi>{{cite web|title=Mairead Maguire - Northern Ireland, 1976|url=http://nobelwomensinitiative.org/meet-the-laureates/mairead-maguire/|publisher=Nobel Women's Initiative|access-date=2 December 2013}}</ref> Published in 2010, it is a collection of essays and letters, in many of which she discusses the connections between her political activities and her faith. Most of the book is about Northern Ireland, but Maguire also discusses the Holocaust, India, East Timor, and Yugoslavia. Maguire writes that "hope for the future depends on each of us taking non-violence into our hearts and minds and developing new and imaginative structures which are non-violent and life-giving for all.... Some people will argue that this is too idealistic. I believe it is very realistic.... We can rejoice and celebrate today because we are living in a miraculous time.

In 1990 she was awarded the [[Pacem in Terris Award]], named after a 1963 [[encyclical]] letter by [[Pope John XXIII]] that called upon all people of good will to secure peace among all nations. The Davenport Catholic Interracial Council extolled Maguire for her peace efforts in Northern Ireland and for being "a global force against violence in the name of religion."<ref>{{cite web|title=Pacem in Terris |url=http://www.davenportdiocese.org/socialaction/sapitrecipients.htm |work=davenportdiocese.org |publisher=[[Diocese of Davenport]] |access-date=21 March 2011 |quote=MAIREAD CORRIGAN MAGUIRE, peace advocate in Ireland, has become a global force against violence in the name of religion.

==Criticism==
===Nobel Prize decision and Peace People movement===
Referring to the decision to award Mairead Maguire and Betty Williams the 1976 Nobel Peace Prize, journalist [[Michael Binyon]] of ''[[The Times]]'' commented, "The Nobel committee has made controversial awards before. Some have appeared to reward hope rather than achievement." He described as sadly "negligible" the two women's contribution to bringing peace to Northern Ireland.<ref>{{cite web |last=Binyon |first=Michael |title=Comment: absurd decision on Obama makes a mockery of the Nobel Peace Prize |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article6867711.ece |work=The Times |location=UK |date=9 October 2009 |access-date=1 February 2011}}</ref>

[[Alex Maskey]] of [[Sinn Féin]] charged that at the time of the Troubles, the Peace People movement was hijacked by the British government and used to turn public opinion against [[Irish republicanism]]. "For me and others, the Peace People and their good intentions were quickly exploited and absorbed into British state policy," Maskey opined.<ref>{{cite web |title=Legacy of NI peace movement |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/4781091.stm |work=BBC News|date=11 August 2006 |access-date=2 February 2011}}</ref>

[[Derek Brown (journalist)|Derek Brown]], the Belfast correspondent for ''[[The Guardian]]'', wrote that Maguire and Betty Williams were "both formidably articulate and, in the best possible sense, utterly naive." He described their call for an end to violence in response to the will of the people as an "awesomely impractical demand."<ref>{{cite news |title=The Sad History of Ulster's Peace Movements |first=Derek |last=Brown |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=16 August 1976 |quote=they are both formidably articulate and, in the best possible sense, utterly naive...Their simple, awesomely impractical demand is that all men of violence lay down their arms in response to the will of the people.}}</ref>

In his extensive study of the Peace People movement, Rob Fairmichael found that the Peace People were seen by some as being "more anti-[[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] than anti-[[Ulster Defence Association|UDA]]," i.e. less loyal to republican factions than to loyalist ones. Fairmichael also noted that "Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan were beaten up numerous times and at times the leaders were threatened by a hostile crowd." Fairmichael noted, as examples of forms that some of the extreme negative reactions took.<ref>Fairmichael, pp. 17, 18</ref>

===Prize money controversy===
While most Nobel Prize laureates keep their prize money,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Reflections on the prize of prizes: Alfred Nobel|doi=10.1096/fj.06-1102ufm |journal=[[The FASEB Journal]]|pmid=17077294|year=2006|last1=Pederson|first1=T.|volume=20|issue=13|pages=2186–9|s2cid=30015190 }}</ref> it is not uncommon for prize winners to donate prize money to scientific, cultural or humanitarian causes.<ref>{{cite web|last=Locke|first=Michelle|title=Berkeley Nobel laureates donate prize money to charity|url=http://www.ebcf.org/press/07/Smoot_AP_3-07.pdf|access-date=2 February 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726012539/http://ebcf.org/press/07/Smoot_AP_3-07.pdf|archive-date=26 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref><!--The preceding information and references come from Wikipedia articles about the Nobel Prize--> Upon announcing their intention to keep their prize funds, Maguire and Williams were severely criticised.<ref>Abrams (2001) p. 28</ref>{{by whom|date=June 2013}} The move angered many people, including members of the Peace People, and fuelled unpleasant rumours about the two women.<ref>Buscher, pp. 89–90</ref> Rob Fairmichael writes of "gossip of fur coats" and concludes that the prize money controversy was perceived by the public, in the context of the Peace People's eventual decline, as specifically problematic.<ref>Fairmichael</ref>

===Jewish and Israeli reactions===
In the wake of the 2009 Gaza flotilla, [[Ben-Dror Yemini]], a popular columnist for the Israeli daily ''Ma'ariv'', wrote that Maguire was obsessed with Israel. "There is a lunatic coalition that does not concern itself with the slaughtered in Sri Lanka or with the oppressed Tibetans. They see only the struggle against the Israeli Satan." He further charged that Maguire chose to identify with a population that elected an openly antisemitic movement to lead it – one whose raison d'etre is the destruction of the Jewish state.<ref>{{cite web |last=Yemini |first=Ben Dror |title=Hovevei ha-Ayatollot ba-Hevra ha-Yisre'elit (Hebrew) |url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART1/912/921.html |publisher=NRG (Maariv) |date=7 July 2009 |access-date=22 January 2011}}</ref>

Eliaz Luf, the deputy head of the Israeli foreign mission to Canada, has argued that Maguire's activism plays into the hands of Hamas and other terrorist organisations in Gaza.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mittleman |first=Shmuel |title=Calat Pras Nobel le-Shalom Mevaqeshet le-Hishaer ba-Aretz (Hebrew)|url=http://www.nrg.co.il/online/1/ART2/161/761.html |publisher=NRG (Maariv) |date=29 September 2010 |access-date=23 January 2011}}</ref>

Michael Elterman, Chairman of the Canada-Israel Committee Pacific Region, warned that Maguire's actions, though probably well-intentioned, have promoted a hateful, antisemitic agenda.<ref>{{cite web |title=Michael Elterman: Nobel laureate Mairead Maguire's good intentions promote anti-Semitism |url=https://www.straight.com/article-261409/michael-elterman-nobel-laureate-mairead-maguires-good-intentions-promote-antisemitism |work=Georgia Straight |date=6 October 2009 |access-date=23 January 2011}}</ref>

In a 4 October 2010 editorial entitled "The disingenuous Nobel laureate," the ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'' called Maguire's comparison of Israel's nuclear weapons to the gas chambers of Auschwitz "outrageous" and maintained that "Israel can and must use its sovereignty to stop people like Maguire who are essentially seeking to endanger the lives of Israeli citizens." The Post applauded Maguire's expulsion from Israel, "not because of Maguire's outrageous comparison in 2004 of Israel's purported nuclear capability to Auschwitz's gas chambers, nor because of her absurd, reprehensible accusation made in court Monday that Israel is an "apartheid state" perpetrating "ethnic cleansing against Palestinians," but because she had taken "actions that undermine Israel's ability to protect itself.""<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Editorials/Article.aspx?id=190186 |title=Editorial: The disengenuous Nobel laureate |date=4 October 2010 |work=The Jerusalem Post |access-date=5 February 2011}}</ref>

The ''Post'' argued that if Maguire and others "truly desire to improve the lives of Gazans, they should send their humanitarian aid in coordination with Israel," pressure Hamas "and the other radical Islamists who control the Gaza Strip to stop senseless ballistic attacks on Israeli towns and villages, kibbutzim and moshavim," and "insist that Hamas provide Gaza's citizens with a stable, responsible leadership that respects human rights and religious freedom, as well as that it accept the UN-recognized right of the Jewish people to self-determination and political sovereignty in their historical homeland." But Maguire "seems more intent on enabling Israel's terrorist enemies," exploiting "charges of a 'humanitarian crisis' in Gaza in order to empower Hamas terrorists."<ref>{{cite web|title=Editorial: The disingenuous Nobel laureate|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Editorials/Editorial-The-disingenuous-Nobel-laureate|work=The Jerusalem Post|access-date=15 December 2013|date=4 Oct 2010}}</ref> Jewish and Israeli opinion is not all negative. Following the June 2010 Gaza flotilla raid, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was careful to distinguish between Mairead Maguire's nonviolent resistance aboard the ''Rachel Corrie'', which he referred to as "a flotilla of peace activists – with whom we disagree, but whose right to a different opinion we respect," and the conduct of the activists aboard the other six vessels, which he described as "a flotilla of hate, organized by violent, terrorism-supporting extremists."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/navy-takes-over-rachel-corrie-without-incident-1.294382 |title=Navy takes over Rachel Corrie without incident |last1=Yagna |first1=Yanir |last2=Ravid |first2=Barak |last3=Pfeffer |first3=Anshel |date=6 June 2010 |work=Haaretz |access-date=13 February 2011}}</ref> [[Gideon Levy]] strongly defended Mairéad Maguire in the Israeli newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'' in October 2010, calling her "the victim of state terror" after Israel refused to allow her to enter the country and kept her detained for several days.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/a-nobel-peace-prize-laureate-in-prison-1.316807 |last=Levy |first=Gideon |title=A Nobel Peace Prize laureate in prison |work=Haaretz |date=3 October 2010 |access-date=8 February 2011}}</ref>
