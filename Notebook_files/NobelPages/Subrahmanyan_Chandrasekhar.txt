He was awarded the 1983 [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] with [[William Alfred Fowler|William A. Fowler]] for "...theoretical studies of the physical processes of importance to the structure and evolution of the stars". His mathematical treatment of stellar evolution yielded many of the current theoretical models of the later evolutionary stages of massive stars and [[black hole]]s.<ref name=currentscience>{{cite journal | last=Vishveshwara | first=C.V. | title=Leaves from an unwritten diary: S.

Chandrasekhar worked on a wide variety of problems in physics during his lifetime, contributing to the contemporary understanding of [[stellar structure]], [[white dwarf]]s, [[stellar dynamics]], [[stochastic process]], [[radiative transfer]], the [[Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules|quantum theory]] of the [[hydrogen anion]], [[Hydrodynamic stability|hydrodynamic]] and [[Hydromagnetics|hydromagnetic]] stability, [[turbulence]], equilibrium and the stability of [[Jacobi ellipsoid|ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium]], [[general relativity]], mathematical theory of black holes and theory of colliding gravitational waves.<ref name = standrews/> At the [[University of Cambridge]], he developed a theoretical model explaining the structure of white dwarf stars that took into account the relativistic variation of mass with the velocities of electrons that comprise their degenerate matter. He showed that the mass of a white dwarf could not exceed 1.44 times that of the Sun – the [[Chandrasekhar limit]]. Chandrasekhar revised the models of stellar dynamics first outlined by [[Jan Oort]] and others by considering the effects of fluctuating gravitational fields within the [[Milky Way]] on stars rotating about the galactic centre. His solution to this complex dynamical problem involved a set of twenty partial differential equations, describing a new quantity he termed "[[dynamical friction]]", which has the dual effects of decelerating the star and helping to stabilize clusters of stars. Chandrasekhar extended this analysis to the interstellar medium, showing that clouds of galactic gas and dust are distributed very unevenly.

Chandrasekhar studied at [[Presidency College, Chennai|Presidency College, Madras]] (now [[Chennai]]) and the University of Cambridge.  A long-time professor at the [[University of Chicago]], he did some of his studies at the [[Yerkes Observatory]], and served as editor of ''[[The Astrophysical Journal]]'' from 1952 to 1971. He was on the faculty at Chicago from 1937 until his death in 1995 at the age of 84, and was the [[Morton D. Hull]] Distinguished Service Professor of Theoretical Astrophysics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/StarChild/whos_who_level2/chandra.html|title=Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar|website=starchild.gsfc.nasa.gov|access-date=2017-10-19}}</ref>

==Early life and education==

Chandrasekhar was born on 19 October 1910 in [[Lahore]], [[Punjab, British India]] (now [[Pakistan]]) in a [[Tamil Brahmin]] family,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/who-is/who-is-subrahmanyan-chandrasekhar-nobel-prize-winner-physics-4897568/|title=Who was S Chandrasekhar?|date=19 October 2017|website=The Indian Express|language=en|access-date=2019-01-13}}</ref> to Sita Balakrishnan (1891–1931) and Chandrasekhara Subrahmanya Ayyar (1885–1960)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1983/chandrasekhar/biographical/|title=Subramanyan Chandrasekhar Biographical |website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-24}}</ref> who was stationed in Lahore as Deputy Auditor General of the Northwestern Railways at the time of Chandrasekhar's birth. He had two elder sisters, Rajalakshmi and Balaparvathi, three younger brothers, Vishwanathan, Balakrishnan, and Ramanathan and four younger sisters, Sarada, Vidya, Savitri, and Sundari. His paternal uncle was the Indian physicist and Nobel laureate [[Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman]]. His mother was devoted to intellectual pursuits, had translated [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s ''[[A Doll's House]]'' into [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and is credited with arousing Chandra's intellectual curiosity at an early age.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/chandrasekhar-google-honours-171018135910958.html|title=S Chandrasekhar: Why Google honours him|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2017-10-18}}</ref> The family moved from Lahore to [[Allahabad]] in 1916, and finally settled in [[Madras]] in 1918. 

Chandrasekhar was tutored at home until the age of 12.<ref name=":0" /> In middle school his father taught him [[Mathematics]] and [[Physics]] and his mother taught him [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. He later attended the [[The Hindu Higher Secondary School|Hindu High School]], [[Triplicane]], [[Chennai|Madras]] during the years 1922–25. Subsequently, he studied at [[Presidency College, Chennai|Presidency College, Madras]] (affiliated to the [[University of Madras]]) from 1925 to 1930, writing his first paper, "The [[Compton scattering|Compton Scattering]] and the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|New Statistics]]", in 1929 after being inspired by a lecture by [[Arnold Sommerfeld]].<ref name="Chandra_bio_INSA">{{Cite journal | last1 = Trehan | first1 = Surindar Kumar | url =http://insaindia.res.in/BM/BM23_0207.pdf  | title = Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar 1910–1995 | journal = Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Indian National Science Academy| volume = 23 | pages = 101–119 | year = 1995 }}</ref> He obtained his bachelor's degree, BSc (Hon.), in physics, in June 1930. In July 1930, Chandrasekhar was awarded a Government of India scholarship to pursue graduate studies at the [[University of Cambridge]], where he was admitted to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], secured by [[Ralph H. Fowler|R. H. Fowler]] with whom he communicated his first paper. During his travels to [[England]], Chandrasekhar spent his time working out the [[statistical mechanics]] of the [[Degenerate matter#Degenerate gases|degenerate electron gas]] in [[white dwarf]] stars, providing [[special relativity|relativistic]] corrections to Fowler's previous work (see [[#Legacy|Legacy]] below).

==At the University of Cambridge==
In his first year at Cambridge, as a research student of Fowler, Chandrasekhar spent his time calculating mean [[opacity (optics)|opacities]] and applying his results to the construction of an improved model for the limiting mass of the degenerate star. At the meetings of the [[Royal Astronomical Society]], he met [[E. A. Milne]]. At the invitation of [[Max Born]] he spent the summer of 1931, his second year of post-graduate studies, at Born's institute at [[Göttingen]], working on opacities, [[Atomic spectral line#Emission and absorption coefficients|atomic absorption coefficients]], and [[model photosphere|model stellar photospheres]]. On the advice of [[Paul Dirac|P. A. M. Dirac]], he spent his final year of graduate studies at the [[Niels Bohr Institute|''Institute for Theoretical Physics'']] in [[Copenhagen]], where he met [[Niels Bohr]].

After receiving a bronze medal for his work on degenerate stars, in the summer of 1933, Chandrasekhar was awarded his PhD degree at Cambridge with a thesis among his four papers on rotating self-gravitating [[polytrope]]s. On 9 October, he was elected to a Prize Fellowship at Trinity College for the period 1933–1937, becoming only the second Indian to receive a Trinity Fellowship after [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] 16 years earlier. He had been so certain of failing to obtain the fellowship that he had already made arrangements to study under Milne that autumn at Oxford, even going to the extent of renting a flat there.<ref name="Chandra_bio_INSA"/>

During this time, Chandrasekhar became acquainted with British physicist Sir [[Arthur Eddington]]. In an infamous encounter at the Royal Astronomical Society in London in 1935, Eddington publicly ridiculed the concept of the [[Chandrasekhar limit]].<ref name=":0" /> Although Eddington would later be proved wrong by computers and the first positive identification of a black hole in 1972, this encounter caused Chandrasekhar to contemplate employment outside the UK. Later in life, on multiple occasions, Chandrasekhar expressed the view that Eddington's behaviour was in part racially motivated.<ref>[[Kameshwar C. Wali|K.C. Wali]], "Chandrasekhar vs. Eddington: An Unanticipated Confrontation", Physics Today, vol. 35, no. 10, pp. 33–40 (October, 1982)</ref>

==Career and research==

===Early career===
In 1935, Chandrasekhar was invited by the Director of the Harvard Observatory, [[Harlow Shapley]], to be a visiting lecturer in theoretical astrophysics for a three-month period. He travelled to the United States in December. During his visit to Harvard, Chandrasekhar greatly impressed Shapley, but declined his offer of a Harvard research fellowship. At the same time, Chandrasekhar met [[Gerard Kuiper]], a noted Dutch astrophysical observationalist who was then a leading authority on white dwarfs. Kuiper had recently been recruited by [[Otto Struve]], the Director of the [[Yerkes Observatory]] in [[Williams Bay, Wisconsin]], which was run by the [[University of Chicago]], and the university's President [[Robert Maynard Hutchins]]. Having known of Chandrasekhar, Struve was then considering him for one of three faculty posts in astrophysics, along with Kuiper; the other opening had been filled by [[Bengt Stromgren]], a Danish theorist.<ref name="Chandra_bio_INSA"/> Following a praise-filled recommendation from Kuiper, Struve invited Chandrasekhar to Yerkes in March 1936 and offered him the job. Though Chandrasekhar was keenly interested, he initially declined the offer and left for England; after Hutchins sent a radiogram to Chandrasekhar during the voyage, he finally accepted, returning to Yerkes as an Assistant Professor of Theoretical Astrophysics in December 1936.<ref name="Chandra_bio_INSA"/> Hutchins also intervened on an occasion where Chandra's participation on teaching a course organised by Struve, was vetoed by the dean [[Henry Gale (astrophysicist)|Henry Gale]] based on a racial prejudice; Hutchins said "By all means have Mr.Chandrasekhar teach".<ref>https://www.nap.edu/read/5859/chapter/4</ref>

Chandrasekhar remained at the University of Chicago for his entire career. He was promoted to associate professor in 1941 and to full professor two years later at just 33 years of age.<ref name="Chandra_bio_INSA"/> In 1946, when [[Princeton University]] offered Chandrasekhar a position vacated by [[Henry Norris Russell]] with a salary double that of Chicago's, Hutchins incremented his salary matching with that of Princeton's and persuaded Chandrasekhar to stay in Chicago. In 1952, he became [[Morton D. Hull]] Distinguished Service Professor of Theoretical Astrophysics and [[Enrico Fermi Institute]], upon [[Enrico Fermi]]'s invitation. In 1953, he and his wife, Lalitha Chandrasekhar, took American citizenship.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.financialexpress.com/lifestyle/science/s-chandrashekhar-indias-great-astrophysicist-why-google-doodle-is-celebrating-the-nobel-prize-winner/899544/ |title=S Chandrashekhar, India's great astrophysicist: Why Google Doodle is celebrating the Nobel prize winner |date=19 October 2017 |work=The Financial Express |access-date=2017-10-19 |language=en-US}}</ref>

After the Laboratory for Astrophysics and Space Research (LASR) was built by NASA in 1966 at the university, Chandrasekhar occupied one of the four corner offices on the second floor.  (The other corners housed [[John Alexander Simpson|John A. Simpson]], [[Peter Meyer (astrophysicist)|Peter Meyer]], and [[Eugene N. Parker]].) Chandrasekhar lived at 4800 Lake Shore Drive after the high-rise apartment complex was built in the late 1960s, and later at 5550 Dorchester Building.

===World War II===

During World War II, Chandrasekhar worked at the [[Ballistic Research Laboratory]] at the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]] in Maryland.  While there, he worked on problems of [[ballistics]], resulting in reports such as 1943's ''[[:s:On the Decay of Plane Shock Waves|On the decay of plane shock waves]]'', ''[[:s:Optimum height for the bursting of a 105mm shell|Optimum height for the bursting of a 105mm shell]]'', ''[[:s:On the Conditions for the Existence of Three Shock Waves|On the Conditions for the Existence of Three Shock Waves]]'',<ref>{{cite report |last=Chandrasekhar |first=S. |year=1943 |title=On the conditions for the existence of three shock waves |publisher=Ballistic Research Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground |id=367}}</ref> ''[[:s:On the Determination of the Velocity of a Projectile from the Beat Waves Produced by Interference with the Waves of Modified Frequency Reflected from the Projectile|On the Determination of the Velocity of a Projectile from the Beat Waves Produced by Interference with the Waves of Modified Frequency Reflected from the Projectile]]''<ref>{{cite report |last=Chandrasekhar |first=S. |year=1943 |title=On the Determination of the Velocity of a Projectile from the Beat Waves Produced by Interference with the Waves of Modified Frequency Reflected from the Projectile |publisher=Ballistic Research Laboratory, Aberdeen Proving Ground |id=365}}</ref> and ''[[:s:The normal reflection of a blast wave|The normal reflection of a blast wave]]''.<ref>{{cite report |last=Chandrasekhar |first=S. |year=1943 |title=Optimum Height for the Bursting of a 105mm Shell |id=BRL-MR-139 |publisher=Army Ballistic Research Lab Aberdeen Procing Ground MD |url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/492801.pdf}}</ref><ref name=standrews>{{cite web|last=O'Connor|first=J.

F }}</ref> Chandrasekhar's expertise in hydrodynamics led [[Robert Oppenheimer]] to invite him to join the [[Manhattan Project]] at Los Alamos, but delays in the processing of his security clearance prevented him from contributing to the project. It has been rumoured that he visited the [[Calutron]] project.

===Philosophy of systematization===

He wrote that his scientific research was motivated by his desire to participate in the progress of different subjects in science to the best of his ability, and that the prime motive underlying his work was ''systematization''. "What a scientist tries to do essentially is to select a certain domain, a certain aspect, or a certain detail, and see if that takes its appropriate place in a general scheme which has form and coherence; and, if not, to seek further information which would help him to do that".<ref>''The Works of the Mind'', p.176, edited by Robert B. Heywood, University of Chicago Press, 1947.</ref>

Chandrasekhar developed a unique style of mastering several fields of physics and astrophysics; consequently, his working life can be divided into distinct periods. He would exhaustively study a specific area, publish several papers in it and then write a book summarizing the major concepts in the field. He would then move on to another field for the next decade and repeat the pattern. Thus he studied [[stellar structure]], including the theory of [[white dwarfs]], during the years 1929 to 1939, and subsequently focused on [[stellar dynamics]], theory of [[Brownian motion]] from 1939 to 1943. Next, he concentrated on the theory of [[radiative transfer]] and the quantum theory of the [[hydride|negative ion of hydrogen]] from 1943 to 1950. This was followed by sustained work on [[turbulence]] and hydrodynamic and hydromagnetic stability from 1950 to 1961. In the 1960s, he studied the equilibrium and the stability of ellipsoidal figures of equilibrium, and also general relativity. During the period, 1971 to 1983 he studied the mathematical theory of [[black holes]], and, finally, during the late 80s, he worked on the theory of colliding [[gravitational waves]].<ref name = standrews/>

===Work with students===

Chandra worked closely with his students and expressed pride in the fact that over a 50-year period (from roughly 1930 to 1980), the average age of his co-author collaborators had remained the same, at around 30. He insisted that students address him as "Prof. Chandrasekhar" until they received their PhD degree, after which time they (as other colleagues) were encouraged to address him as "Chandra". When Chandrasekhar was working at the Yerkes Observatory in 1940s, he would drive {{convert|150|mi|km}} to and fro every weekend to teach a course at the University of Chicago. Two of the students who took the course, [[Tsung-Dao Lee]] and [[Chen-Ning Yang]], won the Nobel prize before he could get one for himself. Regarding classroom interactions during his lectures, noted astrophysicist [[Carl Sagan]] stated from firsthand experience that "frivolous questions" from unprepared students were "dealt with in the manner of a summary execution", while questions of merit "were given serious attention and response".<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Chandra : a biography of S.

===Other activities===

From 1952 to 1971 Chandrasekhar was editor of ''[[The Astrophysical Journal]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal | author=Helmut A. Abt | date=1 December 1995 | title= Obituary – Chandrasekhar, Subrahmanyan | journal=Astrophysical Journal | volume=454 | pages=551 | bibcode=1995ApJ...454..551A|doi = 10.1086/176507 }}</ref> When [[Eugene Parker]] submitted a paper on his discovery of [[solar wind]] in 1957, two eminent reviewers rejected the paper. However, since Chandra as an editor could not find any mathematical flaws in Parker's work, he went ahead and published the paper in 1958.<ref>Parker, E. N. (1958). Dynamics of the interplanetary gas and magnetic fields. The Astrophysical Journal, 128, 664.</ref>

During the years 1990 to 1995, Chandrasekhar worked on a project devoted to explaining the detailed geometric arguments in Sir [[Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'' using the language and methods of ordinary calculus.  The effort resulted in the book ''Newton's Principia for the Common Reader'', published in 1995. Chandrasekhar was an honorary member of the International Academy of Science.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Personal life==
Chandrasekhar married Lalitha Doraiswamy in September 1936. He had met her as a fellow student at [[Presidency College, Chennai|Presidency College]]. Chandrasekhar was the nephew of [[C.V. Raman]], who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1930. He became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the U.S. in 1953. Many considered him as warm, positive, generous, unassuming, meticulous, and open to debate, while some others as private, intimidating, impatient and stubborn regarding non-scientific matters,<ref name=":1" /> and unforgiving to those who ridiculed his work.<ref name=":2">{{Cite book|title=S.

Chandrasekhar died of a sudden [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] at the University of Chicago Hospital in 1995, having survived a prior heart attack in 1975.<ref name=":1" /> He was survived by his wife, who died on 2 September 2013 at the age of 102.<ref>{{Cite news|work=[[The Hindu]]|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/nobel-laureates-wife-lalitha-chandrasekhar-dies-at-102/article5101654.ece|title=Nobel laureate's wife Lalitha Chandrasekhar dies at 102|date=7 September 2013}}</ref> She was a serious student of literature and western classical music.<ref name=":2" />

Once when involved in a discussion about the [[Bhagavad Gita|Gita]], Chandrasekhar said, "I should like to preface my remarks with a personal statement in order that my later remarks will not be misunderstood. I consider myself an atheist".<ref>''S. Chandrasekhar: the man behind the legend,'' Kameshwar C. Wali.

==Awards, honours and legacy==

===Nobel prize===

Chandrasekhar was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1983 for his studies on the physical processes important to the [[stellar structure|structure]] and [[stellar evolution|evolution of stars]]. Chandrasekhar accepted this honor, but was upset the citation mentioned only his earliest work, seeing it as a denigration of a lifetime's achievement. He shared it with [[William A. Fowler]].

===Legacy===

Chandrasekhar's most notable work is on the [[astrophysics|astrophysical]] [[Chandrasekhar limit]]. The limit gives the maximum mass of a [[white dwarf]] star, ~1.44 [[solar mass]]es, or equivalently, the minimum mass that must be exceeded for a star to collapse into a [[neutron star]] or [[black hole]] (following a [[supernova]]). The limit was first calculated by Chandrasekhar in 1930 during his maiden voyage from India to [[Cambridge, England]] for his graduate studies. In 1979, [[NASA]] named the third of its four "[[Great Observatories program|Great Observatories]]" after Chandrasekhar. This followed a naming contest which attracted 6,000 entries from fifty states and sixty-one countries. The [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]] was launched and deployed by [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'']] on 23 July 1999. The [[Chandrasekhar number]], an important [[dimensionless number]] of [[magnetohydrodynamics]], is named after him. The [[asteroid]] [[1958 Chandra]] is also named after Chandrasekhar. The [[Indian Astronomical Observatory#Facilities|Himalayan Chandra Telescope]] is named after him. In the ''Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society of London'', R. J. Tayler wrote: "Chandrasekhar was a classical applied mathematician whose research was primarily applied in astronomy and whose like will probably never be seen again."<ref name=frs>{{Cite journal | last1 = Tayler | first1 = R.
