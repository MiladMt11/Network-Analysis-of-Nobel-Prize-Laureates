==Early life and education==
MacDiarmid was born in [[Masterton]], New Zealand as one of five children – three brothers and two sisters. His family was relatively poor, and the [[Great Depression]] made life difficult in Masterton, due to which his family shifted to [[Lower Hutt]], a few miles from [[Wellington]], New Zealand. At around age ten, he developed an interest in [[chemistry]] from one of his father's old textbooks, and he taught himself from this book and from library books.

MacDiarmid was educated at [[Hutt Valley High School]] and [[Victoria University of Wellington]].<ref name="ab">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2000/macdiarmid-autobio.html|title=Alan G.

In 1943, MacDiarmid passed the University of New Zealand's University Entrance Exam and its Medical Preliminary Exam.<ref name="nz">

</ref> He then took up a part-time job as a "lab boy" or janitor in Victoria University of Wellington, during his studies for a BSc degree, which he completed in 1947.<ref name=nz/> He was then appointed demonstrator in the undergraduate laboratories.<ref name=nz/> After completing an MSc in chemistry from the same university, he later worked as an assistant in its chemistry department.<ref name=ab/> It was here that he had his first publication in 1949, in the scientific journal ''Nature''.<ref name=nz/> He graduated in 1951 with first class honours, and won a [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Fellowship]] to the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. He majored in inorganic chemistry, receiving his M.S. degree in 1952 and his PhD in 1953. He then won a Shell Graduate Scholarship, which enabled him to go to [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]], where he completed a second PhD in 1955.<ref name=ab/><ref>{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Cambridge|title=The chemistry of some new derivatives of the silyl radical|first= Alan Graham|last=MacDiarmid|date=1955|url=http://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.648061}}</ref>

==Career and research==
MacDiarmid worked in the School of Chemistry at the [[University of St Andrews]] in Scotland for a year as a member of the junior faculty. He then took a faculty position in chemistry at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], USA, where he became a full professor in 1964. MacDiarmid spent the greater part of his career on the chemistry faculty of the University of Pennsylvania, where he worked for 45 years.<ref name=ab/> The first twenty years of his research there focused on [[silicon]] chemistry.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} He was appointed Blanchard Professor of Chemistry in 1988.<ref>"Chairs for Five SAS Faculty".  ''Almanac'' (University of Pennsylvania newsletter), '''35(1)''', 12 July 1988.</ref>

In 2002 MacDiarmid also joined the faculty of the [[University of Texas at Dallas]].<ref name="nyt">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/08/obituaries/08macdiarmid.html|title=Alan MacDiarmid, 79, Who Won Nobel for Work With Plastic, Dies|work=The New York Times|access-date=1 March 2018 | first=Kenneth | last=Chang | date=8 February 2007}}</ref>

=== Conductive polymers===
His best-known research was the discovery and development of [[conductive polymers]]—plastic materials that conduct electricity. He collaborated with the Japanese chemist [[Hideki Shirakawa]] and the American physicist [[Alan Heeger]] in this research and published the first results in 1977.<ref name="HMacSh">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1039/C39770000578|title= Synthesis of electrically conducting organic polymers: Halogen derivatives of polyacetylene, (CH) x|year=1977| last1=Shirakawa|first1=Hideki| last2=Louis|first2=Edwin J.|last3=MacDiarmid| first3=Alan G.| last4=Chiang|first4 =Chwan K.| last5=Heeger|first5=Alan J.| journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Chemical Communications|issue=16 |pages=578|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA041866}}</ref> The three of them shared the 2000 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for this work.<ref>[http://www.upenn.edu/almanac/v47/n08/nobel2000.html "The Long and Winding Road to the Nobel Prize for Alan MacDiarmid".

The Nobel Prize was awarded for the discovery that plastics can, after certain modifications, be made electrically conductive.<ref name="NZ_Herald_10423031"/> The work progressed to yield important practical applications. Conductive plastics can be used for anti-static substances for photographic film and 'smart' windows that can exclude sunlight. Semi-conductive polymers have been applied in light-emitting diodes, solar cells and displays in mobile telephones. Future developments in molecular electronics are predicted to dramatically increase the speed while reducing the size of computers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

MacDiarmid also travelled around the world for speaking engagements that impressed upon listeners the value of globalising the effort of innovation in the 21st century. In one of his last courses, in 2001, MacDiarmid elected to lead a small seminar of incoming freshmen about his research activities. Overall, his name is on over 600 published papers and 20 patents.<ref name=nyt/>
MacDiarmid was also active as a naturist and [[nudist]], and considered himself a sun-worshipper and keen waterskier.<ref>[http://naturistmusings.blogspot.com/2007_02_01_archive.html Article with Naturist Musings]</ref><ref name="NZ_Herald_10423031">{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=10423031 |title=The Nobel-prize winning naturist – Alan MacDiarmid remembered |author=Kent Atkinson of NZPA |date=9 February 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |access-date=16 September 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://mynudelife.com/home/modules/news/article.php?storyid=96 My Nude Life]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930090902/http://mynudelife.com/home/modules/news/article.php?storyid=96 |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref>

==Personal life==
Towards the end of his life, MacDiarmid was ill with [[myelodysplastic syndrome]]. In early February 2007 he was planning to travel back to New Zealand, when he fell down the stairs in his home in [[Drexel Hill, Pennsylvania]], a suburb of [[Philadelphia]],<ref>[http://www.upenn.edu/gazette/0307/gaz02.html "Nobel-Winner MacDiarmid Dies".  ''Pennsylvania Gazette'', March 2007.]</ref> and died on 7 February 2007.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/3955234a11.html|title=NZ Nobel Prize winner dies|publisher=[[NZPA]]|date=8 February 2007|access-date=8 February 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922214848/http://www.stuff.co.nz/3955234a11.html|archive-date=22 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> He is buried at [[Arlington Cemetery (Pennsylvania)|Arlington Cemetery]] in Drexel Hill.

MacDiarmid's first wife, Marian Mathieu, who he had married in 1954,<ref name=nz/> died in 1990. He is survived by four children: Heather McConnell, Dawn Hazelett, Duncan MacDiarmid and Gail Williams, from their marriage and nine grandchildren: Dr. Sean McConnell, Dr. Ryan McConnell, Rebecca McConnell, Dr. Clayton Hazelett, Wesley Hazelett, Langston MacDiarmid, Aubree Williams, Austin Williams and George Williams. MacDiarmid was also survived by his second wife, Gayl Gentile, whom he married in 2005; she died in 2014.<ref name=nyt/>

Alan MacDiarmid was a first cousin of New Zealand expatriate painter [[Douglas MacDiarmid]]. The year after Alan received the [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]], Douglas [http://www.douglasmacdiarmid.com/portrait-alan-macdiarmid/ painted a portrait] of his cousin for the [[New Zealand Portrait Gallery]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nzportraitgallery.org.nz/portraits-online/portraits/alan-macdiarmid|title=Alan MacDiarmid |website= The New Zealand Portrait Gallery |language=en|access-date=2017-02-22}}</ref>
