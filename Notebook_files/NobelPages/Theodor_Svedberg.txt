'''Theodor Svedberg''' (30 August 1884 – 25 February 1971) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[chemist]] and [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel laureate]] for his research on [[colloid]]s and proteins using the [[ultracentrifuge]]. Svedberg was active at [[Uppsala University]] from the mid 1900s to late 1940s. While at Uppsala, Svedberg started as a [[docent]] before becoming the university's [[physical chemistry]] head in 1912. After leaving Uppsala in 1949, Svedberg was in charge of the Gustaf Werner Institute until 1967. Apart from his 1926 Nobel Prize, Svedberg was named a [[Foreign Member of the Royal Society]] in 1944 and became part of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1945.

==Career==
While at Uppsala, Svedberg started his scientific career in 1905 as an assistant chemist with the university.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Svedberg, Theodor|year=2004|encyclopedia=Chemistry: Foundations and Applications|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|location=New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gD0pAAAAYAAJ&q=%22assistant+at+the+Chemical+Institute+in+1905%22 |editor-last=Lagowski|editor-first=J.

==Research==
Svedberg's work with [[colloid]]s supported the theories of [[Brownian motion]] put forward by [[Albert Einstein]] and the Polish [[geophysics|geophysicist]] [[Marian Smoluchowski]]. During this work, he developed the technique of [[analytical ultracentrifugation]], and demonstrated its utility in distinguishing pure [[protein]]s one from another.<ref name="frs"/><ref>{{Cite journal

==Awards and honours==
