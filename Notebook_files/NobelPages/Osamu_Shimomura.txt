Born in [[Fukuchiyama, Kyoto]] in 1928, Shimomura was brought up in [[Manchukuo]] ([[Manchuria]], China) and [[Osaka, Japan]] while his father served as an officer in the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. Later, his family moved to [[Isahaya, Nagasaki]],<ref name="aglow">{{cite web|url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog/PIEAGL.html|title=Aglow in the Dark: The Revolutionary Science of Biofluorescence|website=Harvard University Press|access-date=2017-11-28}}</ref> 25&nbsp;km from the epicenter of the August 1945 [[atomic bombing of Nagasaki|atomic bombing of the city]]. He recalled hearing, as a 16-year-old boy, the bomber plane ''[[Bockscar]]'' before the atom bomb exploded.<ref name="nobel1">Nobelprize.org: [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2008/shimomura-lecture.html  Nobel laureate lecture.] December 8, 2008.</ref>  The explosion flash blinded Shimomura for about thirty seconds, and he was later drenched by the "black rain" bomb fallout.<ref>{{cite web | title= Osamu Shimomura The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2008 Interview | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2008/shimomura-telephone.html | publisher=The Official Web Site of the Nobel Foundation | access-date=2009-01-12}}</ref> He overcame great odds in the following 11 years to earn an education and achieve academic success.<ref name="aglow"/>

Shimomura's education opportunities were starkly limited in devastated, post-war Japan. Although he later recalled having no interest in the subject,<ref name="nobel1"/> he enrolled in the College of Pharmaceutical Sciences of Nagasaki Medical College (now [[Nagasaki University]] School of Pharmaceutical Sciences).<ref name="woodshole1">{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/breaking_news/2008/10/woods_hole_cell.html|website=boston.com|title=Woods Hole cell biologist wins Nobel Prize|access-date=2017-11-28}}</ref> The Medical College campus had been entirely destroyed by the atomic bomb blast, forcing the pharmacy school to relocate to a temporary campus near Shimomura's home. This proximity was the fortuitous reason he embarked upon the studies and career which would ultimately lead to unanticipated rewards.<ref name="nobel1"/> Shimomura was awarded a [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] degree in pharmacy in 1951, and he stayed on as a lab assistant through 1955.<ref name="nobel1"/>

Shimomura's mentor at Nagasaki helped him find employment as an assistant to Professor [[Yoshimasa Hirata]] at [[Nagoya University]] in 1956.<ref name="woodshole1"/> While working for Professor Hirata, he received a [[Master of Science|MS]] degree in organic chemistry in 1958 and, before leaving Japan for an appointment at Princeton University, a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in organic chemistry in 1960 at Nagoya University.<ref>{{cite web|title=Former Associate Professor Osamu Shimomura Wins the Nobel Prize in Chemistry |url=http://www.nagoya-u.ac.jp/en/index1_081008nobel.html |publisher=Nagoya university |access-date=2008-12-05 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=下村脩先生が2008年ノーベル化学賞をご受賞 | url=http://www2.chem.nagoya-u.ac.jp/%7Ecommon/005Overview/nobel2008.phtml | publisher=Nagoya University | access-date=2008-12-05 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219231239/http://www2.chem.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~common/005Overview/nobel2008.phtml | archive-date=2008-12-19 }}</ref> At Nagoya, Hirata assigned Shimomura the challenging task of determining what made the crushed remains of a type of [[crustacean]] (Jp. ''umi-hotaru'', lit. "sea-firefly", ''[[Vargula hilgendorfii]]'') glow when moistened with water. This assignment led Shimomura to the successful identification of the protein causing the phenomenon, and he published the preliminary findings in the ''[[Bulletin of the Chemical Society of Japan]]'' in a paper titled "Crystalline Cypridina luciferin." The article caught the attention of Professor Frank Johnson at [[Princeton University]], and Johnson successfully recruited Shimomura to work with him in 1960.

==Study==
Shimomura worked in the Department of Biology at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] for Professor Johnson to study the [[Bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] jellyfish ''[[Aequorea victoria]]'', which they collected during many summers at the [[Friday Harbor Laboratories]] of the [[University of Washington]].<ref name="princeton">{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S22/34/86O07/index.xml?section=topstories|title=Nobel goes to former Princeton researcher for discovery made here|website=princeton.edu|access-date=2017-11-28}}</ref> In 1962, their work culminated in the discovery of the proteins [[aequorin]] and [[green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) in ''A. victoria'';<ref>{{cite web | title=GFP History | url=http://www.conncoll.edu/ccacad/zimmer/GFP-ww/shimomura.html | publisher=Marc Zimmer | access-date=2008-12-09}}</ref> for this work, he was awarded a third of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2008.

==Family==
His wife, Akemi, whom Shimomura met at [[Nagasaki University]], is also an organic chemist and was a partner in his research activities. Their son, [[Tsutomu Shimomura]], is a computer security expert who was involved in the arrest of [[Kevin Mitnick]]. Their daughter, Sachi Shimomura, is director of Undergraduate Studies for the English Department at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] and the author of ''Odd Bodies and Visible Ends in Medieval Literature''.
