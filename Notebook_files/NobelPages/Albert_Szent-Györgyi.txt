==Early life==
Szent-Györgyi was born in [[Budapest]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]] in 1893. His father, Miklós Szent-Györgyi, was a landowner, born in [[Târgu Mureş|Marosvásárhely]], [[Transylvania]] (today Târgu Mureş, [[Romania]]), a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]], and could trace his ancestry back to 1608 when Sámuel, a Calvinist predicant, was ennobled.<ref>Dr.Czeizel, E.: Családfa, page 148, Kossuth Könyvkiadó,1992.</ref><ref>Dr. Czeizel E. : Az érték még mindig bennünk van, page 172, Akadémiai kiadó, Budapest</ref> At the time of Szent-Györgyi's birth, being of the nobility was considered important and created opportunities that otherwise were not available.<ref name=Gaylord>{{cite news

His mother Jozefina prepared to become an opera singer and auditioned for Gustav Mahler, then a conductor at the [[Budapest Opera]]. He advised her to marry instead, since her voice was not enough. Albert himself was good at the piano, while his brother Pál became a professional violinist.

==Education==
[[File:WGBBBC Albert Szent-Györgyi.jpg|right|thumb|Szent-Györgyi in 1917 Italy]]
Szent-Györgyi began his studies at the [[Semmelweis University]] in 1911,<ref name=Heritage/> and then began research in his uncle's anatomy lab. His studies were interrupted in 1914 to serve as an army medic in World War I. In 1916, disgusted with the war, Szent-Györgyi shot himself in the arm,<ref>[http://www.history.com/news/2011/09/16/remembering-albert-szent-gyorgyi/ Remembering Albert Szent-Györgyi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118005626/http://www.history.com/news/2011/09/16/remembering-albert-szent-gyorgyi/ |date=2011-11-18 }}. [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]]. 16 Sep 2011. Last accessed 16 Sep 2011.</ref> claimed to be wounded from enemy fire, and was sent home on medical leave. He was then able to finish his medical education and received his MD in 1917.<ref name=Heritage/> He married [[Kornélia Demény]], the daughter of the Hungarian Postmaster General, that same year.<ref name="first" />

After the war, Szent-Györgyi began his research career in [[Pozsony]] (today [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]]). He switched universities several times over the next few years, finally ending up at the [[University of Groningen]], where his work focused on the [[chemistry]] of [[cellular respiration]]. This work landed him a position as a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] fellow at the [[University of Cambridge]]. He received his [[PhD]] from the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1929<ref name=aphd>{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Cambridge|url=https://copac.jisc.ac.uk/id/39560580?style=html|title=Observations on the functions of peroxidase systems and the chemistry of the adrenal cortex|first=Albert|last=Szent-Györgyi|date=1929|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.648034}}|website=Jisc.ac.uk|oclc=1063377732}}{{Dead link|date=June 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> where he was a student at [[Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge]]. His research involved isolating an [[organic acid]], which he then called "hexuronic acid", from adrenal gland tissue.<ref name=aphd/>

==Career and research==
He accepted a position at the [[University of Szeged]] in 1930.<ref name=Heritage/> There Szent-Györgyi and his research fellow Joseph Svirbely found that "hexuronic acid" was actually the thus far unidentified [[antiscorbutic]] factor, known as [[vitamin C]]. After [[Walter Norman Haworth]] had determined the structure of vitamin C, and in honour of its antiscorbutic properties, it was given the formal chemical name of [[L-ascorbic acid]]. In some experiments they used [[paprika]] as the source for their vitamin C. Also during this time, Szent-Györgyi continued his work on cellular respiration, identifying [[fumaric acid]] and other steps in what would become known as the [[Krebs cycle]]. In Szeged he also met [[Zoltán Bay]], physicist, who became his personal friend and partner in research on matters of bio-physics.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

In 1937 he received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] "for his discoveries in connection with the biological combustion process with special reference to vitamin C and the [[catalysis]] of [[fumaric acid]]". Albert Szent-Györgyi offered all of his Nobel prize money to [[Finland]] in 1940. (The [[Hungarian Volunteers in the Winter War]] travelled to fight for the Finns after the [[Soviet invasion of Finland]] in 1939.)

In 1938 he began work on the [[biophysics]] of [[muscle]] movement. He found that muscles contain [[actin]], which when combined with the protein [[myosin]] and the energy source [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], contract muscle fibers. In 1946, Albert received the [[Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh]].

In 1947 Szent-Györgyi established the Institute for Muscle Research at the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] in [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]] with financial support from Hungarian businessman Stephen Rath. However,  Szent-Györgyi still faced funding difficulties for several years, due to his foreign status and former association with the government of a Communist nation. In 1948, he received a research position with the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) in [[Bethesda, Maryland]] and began dividing his time between there and Woods Hole. In 1950, grants from the [[Armour and Company|Armour Meat Company]] and the [[American Heart Association]] allowed him to establish the Institute for Muscle Research.

During the 1950s Szent-Györgyi began using [[electron microscope]]s to study muscles at the subunit level. He received the [[Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research|Lasker Award]] in 1954.  In 1955, he became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States. He was elected a [[Member of the National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS) in 1956.<ref name=nasmember>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/deceased-members/49890.html|title=Albert Szent-Gyorgyi|website=Nasonline.org|access-date=29 April 2019}}</ref>

In the late 1950s, Szent-Györgyi developed a research interest in [[cancer]] and developed ideas on applying the theories of [[quantum mechanics]] to the biochemistry ([[quantum biology]]) of cancer. The death of Rath, who had acted as the financial administrator of the Institute for Muscle Research, left Szent-Györgyi in a financial mess. Szent-Györgyi refused to submit government grants which required him to provide minute details on exactly how he intended to spend the research dollars and what he expected to find. After Szent-Györgyi commented on his financial hardships in a 1971 newspaper interview, attorney Franklin Salisbury contacted him and later helped him establish a private nonprofit organization, the [[National Foundation for Cancer Research]]. Late in life, Szent-Györgyi began to pursue [[free radical]]s as a potential cause of cancer. He came to see cancer as being ultimately an electronic problem at the molecular level.   In 1974, reflecting his interests in quantum physics, he proposed the term "[[negentropy|syntropy]]" replace the term "[[negentropy]]". Ralph Moss, a protégé of his in the years he performed his cancer research, wrote a biography entitled ''Free Radical: Albert Szent-Gyorgyi and the Battle over Vitamin C.''<ref>{{ISBN|0-913729-78-7}}, (1988), Paragon House Publishers, New York.</ref> Aspects of this work are an important precursor to what is now dubbed [[redox signaling]].{{fact|date=January 2021}}

===Statement on scientific discovery===

Albert Szent-Györgyi, who realized that "a discovery must be, by definition, at variance with existing knowledge,"<ref name="Dionysians and Apollonians">{{cite journal|last1=Szent-Györgyi|first1=Albert|title=Dionysians and Apollonians|journal=Science|volume=176|issue=4038|page=966|doi= 10.1126/science.176.4038.966|pmid=17778411|year=1972|bibcode=1972Sci...176..966S}}</ref> divided scientists into two categories: the [[Apollonian and Dionysian|Apollonians and the Dionysians]]. He called scientific dissenters, who explored "the fringes of knowledge," Dionysians. He wrote, "In science the Apollonian tends to develop established lines to perfection, while the Dionysian rather relies on intuition and is more likely to open new, unexpected alleys for research...The future of mankind depends on the progress of science, and the progress of science depends on the support it can find. Support mostly takes the form of grants, and the present methods of distributing grants unduly favor the Apollonian."<ref name="Dionysians and Apollonians"/>

===Involvement in politics===

As the government of [[Gyula Gömbös]] and the associated [[Hungarian National Defence Association]] gained control of politics in Hungary, Szent-Györgyi helped his [[Jews|Jewish]] friends escape from the country. During World War II, he joined the Hungarian [[Resistance during World War II|resistance movement]]. Although Hungary was allied with the [[Axis Powers]], the Hungarian prime minister [[Miklós Kállay]] sent Szent-Györgyi to Istanbul in 1944 under the guise of a scientific lecture to begin secret negotiations with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. The Germans learned of this plot and [[Adolf Hitler]] himself issued a warrant for the arrest of Szent-Györgyi. He escaped from house arrest and spent 1944 to 1945 as a fugitive from the [[Gestapo]].

After the war, Szent-Györgyi had become well-recognized as a public figure and there was some speculation that he might become President of Hungary, should the Soviets permit it. Szent-Györgyi established a laboratory at the [[Eötvös Loránd University|University of Budapest]] and became head of the biochemistry department there. He was elected a member of Parliament and helped re-establish the Academy of Sciences. Dissatisfied with the [[Communist]] rule of Hungary, he emigrated to the United States in 1947.

In 1967, Szent-Györgyi signed a letter declaring his intention to [[tax resistance|refuse to pay taxes]] as a means of protesting against the U.S. war against Vietnam, and urging other people to take a similar stand.<ref>"An Open Letter" [http://collection1.libraries.psu.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/transaction/id/17162 archived at Horowitz Transaction Publishers Archive]</ref>
