==History==
WFP was established in 1961<ref>{{cite web|title=UN Food Programme – History|url=https://www.wfp.org/history|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201009104141/https://www.wfp.org/history|archive-date=9 October 2020|access-date=9 October 2020|publisher=World Food Program}}</ref> after the 1960 [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO) Conference, when [[George McGovern]], director of the US [[Food for Peace]] Programmes, proposed establishing a multilateral food aid programme. WFP launched its first programmes in 1963 by the FAO and the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on a three-year experimental basis, supporting the [[Nubians|Nubian population]] at [[Wadi Halfa]] in Sudan. In 1965, the programme was extended to a continuing basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://library.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/widget/file/zalite_wfp_unday2013_0.pdf|title=World Food Programme – An Overview|author=Elga Zalite|website=Stanford University Library|access-date=9 October 2020|archive-date=2 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201002064413/https://library.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/widget/file/zalite_wfp_unday2013_0.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Background ==
WFP works across a broad spectrum of [[Sustainable Development Goals]],<ref name=":0" /> owing to the fact that [[Food security|food shortages]], [[hunger]], [[malnutrition]] and [[foodborne illness]] cause poor health, which subsequently impacts other areas of sustainable development, such as education, employment and poverty (Sustainable Development Goals [[Sustainable Development Goal 4|Four]], [[Sustainable Development Goal 8|Eight]] and [[Sustainable Development Goal 1|One]] respectively).<ref name=":0" />

The [[COVID-19 pandemic]] in 2020 and lockdown has placed significant pressure on agricultural production, disrupted global value and supply chain. Subsequently, this raises issues of malnutrition and inadequate food supply to households with the poorest of them all gravely affected.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Gulseven|first1=Osman|last2=Al Harmoodi|first2=Fatima|last3=Al Falasi|first3=Majid|last4=ALshomali|first4=Ibrahim|date=2020|title=How the COVID-19 Pandemic Will Affect the UN Sustainable Development Goals?|url=https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=3592933|journal=SSRN Electronic Journal|language=en|doi=10.2139/ssrn.3592933|s2cid=225914413|issn=1556-5068|access-date=9 October 2020|archive-date=9 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201009162556/https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3592933|url-status=live}}</ref> This is expected to cause "132 million more people to suffer from undernourishment in 2020".<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-08-27|title=UN/DESA Policy Brief #81: Impact of COVID-19 on SDG progress: a statistical perspective {{!}} Department of Economic and Social Affairs|url=https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/publication/un-desa-policy-brief-81-impact-of-covid-19-on-sdg-progress-a-statistical-perspective//|access-date=2020-09-24|website=www.un.org|language=en-US|archive-date=9 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201009162601/https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/publication/un-desa-policy-brief-81-impact-of-covid-19-on-sdg-progress-a-statistical-perspective/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Funding==
WFP operations are funded by voluntary donations principally from governments of the world, and also from corporations and private donors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wfp.org/funding-and-donors|title=Funding and donors|website=www.wfp.org|access-date=9 October 2020|archive-date=9 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201009104017/https://www.wfp.org/funding-and-donors|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2020, funding was a record US$8.4 billion  – 5 percent higher than in 2019 – meeting 61 percent of requirements against a funding need of USD 13.7 billion.<ref name="auto"/>

WFP is governed by an executive board which consists of representatives from 36 member states, and provides intergovernmental support, direction and supervision of WFP's activities. The [[European Union]] is a permanent observer in WFP and, as a major donor, participates in the work of its executive board.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/rome/eu_united_nations/work_with_3_un_agencies_rome/index_en.htm|title=European Union|access-date=17 May 2016|archive-date=10 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610002023/http://eeas.europa.eu/delegations/rome/eu_united_nations/work_with_3_un_agencies_rome/index_en.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> WFP is headed by an executive director, who is appointed jointly by the UN Secretary-General and the director-general of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. The executive director is appointed for fixed five-year terms and is responsible for the administration of the organization as well as the implementation of its programmes, projects and other activities.<ref>{{cite web |title=Governance and leadership |url=https://www.wfp.org/governance-and-leadership |website=wfp.org |publisher=World Food Programme |access-date=13 January 2021}}</ref> [[David Beasley]], previously Governor of the U.S. state of [[South Carolina]], was appointed to the role in March 2017. He heads the WFP secretariat, which is headquartered in [[Rome]].

In October 2020, WFP had 19,660 staff.

==Activities==

===Emergencies===
About two-thirds of WFP's life-saving food assistance goes to people facing severe food crises, most of them caused by conflict.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hunger, Conflict, and Improving the Prospects for Peace |url=https://docs.wfp.org/api/documents/WFP-0000119678/download/ |website=wfp.org |publisher=World Food Programme |access-date=9 January 2021}}</ref>In November 2021, WFP issued an urgent warning that 45 million people were on the brink of famine in 43 countries, with the slightest shock likely to push them over the precipice. Conflict, the climate crises, COVID-19 and the rising cost of reaching people were all contributory factors. WFP said it was working with partners to fend off the threat of famine, chiefly through life-saving food and nutrition assistance. Across all of its activities, it was aiming to directly reach 140 million people. The most powerful tool that WFP deploys to save lives in the face of famine is emergency food assistance, while longer term solutions involve strengthening education, nutrition, livelihood resilience and social protection systems.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Khorsandi |first1=Peyvand |last2=Anthem |first2=Paul |title=45 million people at risk of famine require urgent intervention |url=https://www.wfp.org/stories/42-million-people-are-knocking-famines-door-and-us66-billion-could-save-them-now-0 |access-date=25 November 2021 |publisher=World Food Programme |date=8 November 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=WFP - saving lives, preventing famine|url=https://www.wfp.org/stories/wfp-saving-lives-preventing-famine |website=wfp.org |publisher=World Food Programme |access-date=25 November 2021}}</ref>

[[Afghanistan]] is becoming the world’s largest humanitarian crisis, with assessments reported in October 2021 showing that almost 24 million people had been pushed into acute hunger – including 8.7 million in Emergency IPC4 – as the devastating impact of multiple droughts combined with an economic meltdown. WFP was ramping up its support to assist up to 23 million people. It requires an estimated US$220 million a month in 2022. In [[Ethiopia]], it was projected that more 4.3 million people across northern Ethiopia would be facing acute hunger by September 2021, with more than half of those – 2.2 million – in Emergency IPC4 or worse. As conflict escalates and in the absence of any updated analysis, it’s expected that this situation has worsened significantly and up to 7 million people across northern Ethiopia are facing acute hunger. WFP requires US$245 million to respond across all three regions of Afar, Amhara, and Tigray.<ref>{{cite news |title=WFP warns of countdown to catastrophe as acute hunger reaches new peak |url=https://www.wfp.org/news/wfp-warns-countdown-catastrophe-acute-hunger-reaches-new-peak |access-date=25 November 2021 |publisher=World Food Programme |date=8 November 2021}}</ref>
  
WFP's continues its support in [[Yemen]], amidst ongoing conflict, a ravaged economy and a decimated health system unable to cope with COVID-19, factors that are combining to cause one of the worst hunger crises in the world and which threaten famine.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hincks |first1=Joseph |title='2021 Is Going To Be Catastrophic.'

WFP is also a first responder to sudden-onset emergencies. When floods struck Sudan in July 2020, it provided emergency food assistance to nearly 160,000 people.<ref>{{cite news |title=WFP expands assistance to families struggling in flood-devastated regions of Sudan |url=https://www.wfp.org/news/wfp-expands-assistance-families-struggling-flood-devastated-regions-sudan |access-date=8 January 2021 |publisher=World Food Programme |date=17 September 2020}}</ref> WFP provided food as well as vouchers for people to buy vital supplies, while also planning recovery, reconstruction and resilience-building activities, after Cyclone Idai struck Mozambique and floods washed an estimated 400,000 hectares of crops on early 2019.<ref>{{cite news |title=All you need to know about 2020 Nobel Peace Prize winner Word Food Programme |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/all-you-need-to-know-about-nobel-peace-prize-winner-world-food-programme/articleshow/78573291.cms |access-date=6 January 2021 |publisher=Times of India |date=9 October 2020}}</ref>

WFP's emergency is also pre-emptive, in offsetting the potential impact of disasters. In the Sahel region of Africa, amidst economic challenges, climate change and armed militancy, WFP's activities included working with communities and partners to harvest water for irrigation and restore degraded land, and supporting livelihoods through skills training.<ref>{{cite news |title=World Food Programme Reinforces the Resilience of the Population in the Sahel |url=https://unowas.unmissions.org/world-food-programme-reinforces-resilience-population-sahel |access-date=7 January 2021 |publisher=United Nations Office for West Africa and the Sahel |date=2 March 2020}}</ref> It uses early-warning systems to help communities prepare for disasters. In Bangladesh, weather forecasting led to distributions of cash to vulnerable farmers to pay for measures such as reinforcing their homes or stockpiling food ahead of heavy flooding.<ref>{{cite news |title=WFP provides assistance to communities at risk of monsoon flooding |url=https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2020/07/02/wfp-provides-assistance-to-communities-at-risk-of-monsoon-flooding |access-date=9 January 2021 |publisher=World Food Programme |date=2 July 2020}}</ref>

WFP coordinates responses to large-scale emergencies on behalf of the wider humanitarian community, as lead agency of the [[Logistics Cluster]] and the Emergency Telecommunications Cluster.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.etcluster.org/|title=Emergency Telecommunications Cluster (ETC)|website=www.etcluster.org}}</ref>  It also co-leads the Food Security Cluster.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fscluster.org/|title=Food Security Cluster|website=fscluster.org}}</ref> The WFP-managed [[United Nations Humanitarian Air Service]] (UNHAS) serves over 300 destinations globally. WFP also manages the [[United Nations Humanitarian Response Depot]] (UNHRD), a global network of hubs that procures, stores and transports emergency supplies for the organization and the wider humanitarian community. WFP logistical support, including its air service and hubs, has enabled staff and supplies from WFP and partner organizations to reach areas where commercial flights have not been available, during the COVID-19 pandemic.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Chan |first1=Selina |title=The chain that coronavirus cannot break |url=https://www.wfp.org/stories/chain-coronavirus-cannot-break |access-date=9 January 2021 |publisher=World Food Programme |date=31 March 2020}}</ref>

'''Emergency Response procedures'''

WFP has a system of classifications known as the Emergency Response Procedures designed for situations that require an immediate response. This response is activated under the following criteria:
# When human suffering exists and domestic governments cannot respond adequately
# The United Nations reputation is under scrutiny
# When there is an obvious need for aid from WFP

The Emergency Response Classifications are divided as follows, with emergency intensity increasing with each level:<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://documents.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/resources/wfp264770.pdf|title=WFP Emergency Response Classifications|date=8 May 2014|website=World Food Programme|access-date=8 April 2018|archive-date=29 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329102408/http://documents.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/resources/wfp264770.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>
* '''Level 1''' – Response is activated. Resources are allocated to prepare for WFP's local office to respond
* '''Level 2''' – A country's resources require regional assistance with an emergency across one or multiple countries/territories
* '''Level 3 (L3)''' – The emergency overpowers WFP's local offices and requires a global response from the entire WFP organisation

===Climate change===

WFP works with governments and humanitarian partners in responding to increasing number of climate-related disasters. It also takes pre-emptive action to reduce the number of people needing humanitarian assistance. WFP used Forecast-based Financing to provide cash to vulnerable families, allowing them to buy food, reinforce their homes and take other steps to build resilience ahead of torrential rains in Bangladesh in July 2019.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rowling |first1=Megan |title=Analysis: As disaster train gathers speed, efforts gear up to clear the track |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-aid-climatechange-disaster-ana-idUSKBN2781IJ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201023235121/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-aid-climatechange-disaster-ana-idUSKBN2781IJ |url-status=live |archive-date=23 October 2020 |access-date=7 January 2021 |publisher=Reuters |date=23 October 2020}}</ref>  WFP's response to [[Hurricane Dorian]] in the Bahamas in September 2019 was assisted by a regional office in Barbados, which had been set up the previous year to enable better disaster preparedness and response. In advance of Hurricane Dorian, WFP deployed technical experts in food security, logistics and emergency telecommunication, to support a rapid needs assessment. Assessment teams also conducted an initial aerial reconnaissance mission, with the aim of putting teams on the ground as soon as possible.<ref>{{cite news |title=WFP lends expertise before and after Hurricane Dorian |url=https://reliefweb.int/report/bahamas/wfp-lends-expertise-and-after-hurricane-dorian |access-date=11 January 2021 |publisher=ReliefWeb |date=8 September 2019}}</ref>

===School feeding===

School meals encourage parents in vulnerable families to send their children to school, rather than work. They have proved highly beneficial in areas including education and gender equality, health and nutrition, social protection, local economies and agriculture.<ref>{{cite web |title=The impact of school feeding programmes |url=https://docs.wfp.org/api/documents/WFP-0000102338/download/?_ga=2.168978918.694102881.1604921119-1516168960.1603989980 |website=wfp.org |publisher=World Food Programme |access-date=6 January 2021}}</ref> WFP works with partners to ensure school feeding is part of integrated school health and nutrition programmes, which include services such as malaria control, menstrual hygiene and guidance on sanitation and hygiene.<ref>{{cite web |title=Joint Advocacy Brief - Stepping up effective school health and nutrition |url=https://www.wfp.org/publications/joint-advocacy-brief-stepping-effective-school-health-and-nutrition |website=wfp.org |publisher=World Food Programme |access-date=11 January 2021}}</ref>

===Smallholder farmers===
Smallholder farmers produce most of the world's food and are critical in achieving a zero-hunger world. WFP's support to farmers spans a range of activities to help build sustainable food systems, from business-skills training to opening up roads to markets.<ref>{{cite web |title=Changing lives for smallholder farmers |url=https://docs.wfp.org/api/documents/WFP-0000110345/download/ |website=wfp.org |publisher=World Food Programme |access-date=11 January 2021}}</ref> WFP is among a global consortium that forms the {{visible anchor|Farm to Market Alliance}}, which helps smallholder farmers receive information, investment and support, so they can produce and sell marketable surplus and increase their income.<ref>{{cite news |title=Farm to Market Alliance secures additional public funding from Norway |url=https://www.newtimes.co.rw/news/world-food-day-wfp-urges-further-strengthening-food-systems |access-date=11 January 2021 |publisher=World Food Programme |date=28 December 2020}}</ref> WFP connects smallholder farmers to markets in more than 40 countries.

In 2008, WFP coordinated the five-year Purchase for Progress (P4P) pilot project. P4P assists [[smallholding]] farmers by offering them opportunities to access agricultural markets and to become competitive players in the marketplace. The project spanned across 20 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and trained 800,000 farmers in improved agricultural production, post-harvest handling, quality assurance, group marketing, agricultural finance, and contracting with WFP. The project resulted in 366,000 metric tons of food produced and generated more than US$148&nbsp;million in income for its smallholder farmers.<ref>[http://www.wfp.org/sites/default/files/P4P%20-%20Reflections%20on%20the%20pilot%2C%20February%202015.pdf Purchase for Progress: Reflections on the pilot, February 2015] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311083131/http://www.wfp.org/sites/default/files/P4P%20-%20Reflections%20on%20the%20pilot,%20February%202015.pdf |date=11 March 2016 }}.

===Asset creation===
WFP's Food Assistance for Assets (FFA) programme is one of WFP's key initiatives aimed at i) addressing the most vulnerable people's immediate food needs with cash, voucher or food transfers when they need them and ii) improving people and communities' long-term food security and resilience.

Through FFA people receive cash or food-based transfers to address their immediate food needs, while they build or boost assets, such as repairing irrigation systems, bridges, land and water management activities, that will improve their livelihoods by creating healthier natural environments, reducing risks and impact of climate shocks, increasing food productivity, and strengthening resilience to natural disasters over time.

FFA reflects WFP's drive towards food assistance and development rather than food aid and dependency. It does this by placing a focus on the assets and their impact on people and communities rather than on the work to realize them, representing a shift away from the previous approaches such as Food or Cash for Work programmes and large public works programmes.<ref>{{cite news |title=How Asset Creation & Livelihood Diversification Brings Resilience to Kenya's Arid Counties |url=https://www.agrilinks.org/post/how-asset-creation-livelihood-diversification-brings-resilience-kenyas-arid-counties |access-date=9 January 2021 |publisher=Agrilinks |date=13 July 2020}}</ref>

===Cash assistance===

WFP is the largest [[Cash and Voucher Assistance|cash provider]] in the humanitarian community. The aim is to provide better value for people and donors, allowing for increased food choices and diet diversity for beneficiaries, while boosting local smallholder production, retail and the financial sector. WFP and the European Union joined forces with the Government of Turkey and the Turkish Red Crescent to launch the Emergency Social Safety Net in 2016, one of the largest humanitarian cash programmes ever mounted by the United Nations and the largest humanitarian project the EU has ever funded. It provides monthly cash to vulnerable refugees using individual debit cards. A 2019 survey revealed that the project helped prevent 1.7 million refugees from falling deeper into poverty. WFP stepped back in April 2020, with the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]] taking over its role.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Summers |first1=Hannah |title='Why we're paying the rent for a million Syrian refugees' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/mar/26/scheme-cash-transfer-turkey-1m-refugees-eu-aid |access-date=9 January 2021 |work=The Guardian |date=26 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Cash assistance from WFP and the European Union helps keep Syrian refugees in Turkey out of poverty |url=https://www.wfp.org/news/cash-assistance-wfp-and-european-union-helps-keep-syrian-refugees-turkey-out-poverty |access-date=9 January 2021 |publisher=World Food Programme |date=10 March 2020}}</ref>

===Capacity building===
WFP places a strong emphasis on transferring skills and knowledge to a range of public, private and civil society actors who are pivotal to sustaining national policies and programmes. The goal is to build governments' and other partners' capacities to manage disaster risk and improve food security, while also investing in early warning and preparedness systems for climate and other threats. In the most climate disaster-prone provinces of the Philippines for example, WFP is providing emergency response training and equipment to local government units, and helping set up Automated Weather Stations.<ref>{{cite web |title=World Food Programme: Emergency response and preparedness |url=https://docs.wfp.org/api/documents/WFP-0000108994/download/?_ga=2.106464576.2123531880.1575880347-1264218027.1561107831 |website=wfp.org |publisher=World Food Programme |access-date=8 January 2021}}</ref>

===Digital innovation===
WFP's digital transformation centres on deploying the latest technologies and data to help achieve zero hunger. WFP's Munich-based Innovation Accelerator has sourced and supported more than 60 projects spanning 45 countries.<ref>{{cite web |title=WFP Innovation Accelerator |url=https://www.solutions-summit.org/programs/wfp-innovation-accelerator/info |website=solutions-summit.org |publisher=Solutions Summit |access-date=11 January 2021}}</ref> In 2017, WFP launched the Building Blocks programme. It aims to distribute money-for-food assistance to Syrian refugees in Jordan. The project uses blockchain technology to digitize identities and allow refugees to receive food with eye scanning.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Juskalian |first1=Russ |title=Inside the Jordan refugee camp that runs on blockchain |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/2018/04/12/143410/inside-the-jordan-refugee-camp-that-runs-on-blockchain/ |access-date=25 November 2021 |publisher=MIT Technology Review |date=12 April 2018}}</ref> WFP's low-tech hydroponics kits allow refugees to grow barley that feed livestock in the Sahara desert.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Vetter |first1=David |title=Iris Scans, Hydroponics And Blockchain: How Innovation Is Helping Fight Global Hunger |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidrvetter/2020/09/22/iris-scans-hydroponics-and-blockchain-how-innovation-is-helping-fight-global-hunger/ |access-date=9 January 2021 |work=Forbes |date=22 September 2020}}</ref>

===Partnerships===

WFP works with thousands of partners, including governments, private sector, UN agencies, international finance groups, academia, NGOs and other civil society groups. The more than 1,000 NGOs it collaborates with around the world forms its biggest group of partners.<ref>{{cite web |title=Partner with us |url=https://www.wfp.org/partner-with-us |website=wfp.org |publisher=World Food Programme |access-date=8 January 2021}}</ref> WFP places strong emphasis on its partnership with the other two Rome-Based agencies – the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the International Fund for Agricultural Development. The agencies  reaffirmed their joint efforts to end global hunger, particularly amid the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, during a joint meeting of their governing bodies in October 2020.<ref>{{cite news |title=FAO, IFAD and WFP pledge to strengthen collaboration against hunger |url=https://reliefweb.int/report/world/fao-ifad-and-wfp-pledge-strengthen-collaboration-against-hunger |access-date=7 January 2021 |publisher=ReliefWeb |date=12 October 2020}}</ref> In the United States, [[Washington, D.C.]]-based [[501(c)(3) organization]] World Food Program USA supports the WFP. The American organisation frequently donates to the WFP, though the two are separate entities for taxation purposes.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Funke|first1=Daniel|last2=Dc 20036|title=Fact-checking claims about charities linked to Hunter Biden and the Trump children|url=https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/oct/21/left-action/fact-checking-claims-about-charities-linked-hunter/|access-date=2020-10-23|website=PolitiFact|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Recognition and awards===
WFP won the [[2020 Nobel Peace Prize]] for its "efforts for combating hunger", its "contribution to creating peace in conflicted-affected areas," and for acting as a driving force in efforts to prevent the use of [[Food security#Politics|food as a weapon of war and conflict]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Peace Prize |first1=Nobel |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2020/press-release/ |website=The Nobel Prize |access-date=9 October 2020 |title=The Nobel Peace Prize 2020 |archive-date=9 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201009091529/https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/2020/press-release/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/09/uns-world-food-programme-wins-nobel-peace-prize|title=UN's World Food Programme wins Nobel peace prize|date=9 October 2020|website=The Guardian|access-date=9 October 2020|archive-date=9 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201009101202/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/oct/09/uns-world-food-programme-wins-nobel-peace-prize|url-status=live}}</ref> Receiving the award, Executive David Beasley called for billionaires to "step up" and help source the US$5 billion WFP needs to save 30 million people from famine.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McNamara |first1=Audrey |title=U.N.

===Challenges===

In 2018 the [[Center for Global Development]] ranked WFP last in a study of 40 aid programmes, based on indicators grouped into four themes: maximising efficiency, fostering institutions, reducing burdens, and transparency and learning. These indicators relate to aid effectiveness principles developed at the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness (2005), the Accra Agenda for Action (2008), and the Busan Partnership Agreement (2011).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cgdev.org/blog/how-do-you-measure-aid-quality-and-who-ranks-highest|title=How Do You Measure Aid Quality and Who Ranks Highest?|date=15 November 2018|website=Center for Global Development|access-date=11 October 2020}}</ref>

There is wide general debate on the [[Aid#Criticism|net effectiveness of aid]], including unintended consequences such as increasing the duration of conflicts, and increasing corruption. WFP faces difficult decisions on working with some regimes.<ref>'Yemen: World Food Programme to cut aid by half in Houthi-controlled areas', BBC, https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-52239645</ref>
