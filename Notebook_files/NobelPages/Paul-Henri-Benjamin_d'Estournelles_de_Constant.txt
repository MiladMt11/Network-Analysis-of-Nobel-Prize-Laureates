==Biography==
[[File:Balluet d'Estournelles de Constant.jpg|left|thumb|Paul d'Estournelles de Constant|alt=]]
He was born at [[La Flèche]] ([[Sarthe]]) in the [[Loir]] valley to an old aristocratic family which traced its [[genealogy]] back to the [[Crusades]]; the renowned [[French Revolution|Revolution]]-era writer and politician [[Benjamin Constant]] was his great-uncle.  After studying law and Oriental languages at the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]] in Paris, Estournelles de Constant embarked on a diplomatic career in 1876.

Among Estournelles de Constant's early diplomatic posts were [[Montenegro]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], the Netherlands, Great Britain, and Tunisia; in 1882 he returned to Paris to serve as assistant director of the [[Levant]] bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.  In 1890 he was posted to [[London]] as the French [[chargé d'affaires]], where he played a role in averting war with [[United Kingdom|Britain]] over colonial disputes.  Frustrated by the limitations of diplomatic service, he ran for [[Parliament of France|parliament]] in 1895, securing a seat in the [[French Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies]].  In 1904 Estournelles de Constant ran for and won a seat in the [[French Senate|Senate]], where he served until the end of his career in 1924.

As a deputy and senator, Estournelles de Constant concerned himself with colonial issues, consistently opposing [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] colonial policy.  He advocated the elimination of colonial seats in the French parliament, preferring a policy of establishing [[protectorate]]s to the traditional republican programme of colonial [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]].  In particular, he violently opposed the establishment of French colonial rule in [[Madagascar]] and the [[Great Powers]]' dismemberment of [[China]].  In domestic affairs, he was concerned particularly with what the terminology of the day called "outrages against morality" (''outrages aux bonnes mœurs''). He was a [[Dreyfusard]] and argued in favour of placing [[Émile Zola]]'s remains in the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]] for Zola's part in the [[Dreyfus Affair]].

Above all, though, Estournelles de Constant dedicated himself to the cause of improving international relations, and he was a member of the [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]] from 1900.  He represented France at both [[Hague Peace Conference]]s (1898 and 1907), and outlined a vision of a European union.

Estournelles de Constant wrote historical and political works and even dabbled in playwriting.  In addition, he was a regular contributor to the newspapers ''[[Le Temps (Paris)|Le Temps]],'' ''[[La Revue de Paris]],'' and ''[[La Revue des deux mondes]].''  Married to an American, [[Daisy Sedgwick Berend]], he also travelled extensively in and wrote about the [[United States]].

Estournelles de Constant's name may be encountered in numerous variants; the article title reflects the form standardized by the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].

In [[La Flèche]] (Sarthe), his hometown, two schools bear his name: the Estournelles de Constant General and Technological High School, and the Estournelles de Constant Kindergarten.

An amphitheatre bears his name at the UFR (Training and Research Unit) of Law, Economic Sciences and Management of the [[University of Maine (France)|University of Maine]] (Université du Maine).

A monument, including a bust by [[Paul Landowski]], also pays tribute to him on the “Place des [[Jacobin|Jacobins]]” (Jacobins Square), at [[Le Mans]] (coordinates: {{Location|48.0083791|0.1999867}}).
