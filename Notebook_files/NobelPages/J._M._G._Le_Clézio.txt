'''Jean-Marie Gustave Le Clézio''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃ maʁi ɡystav lə klezjo|lang}}; 13 April 1940), usually identified as '''J. M. G. Le Clézio''', of French and Mauritian nationality, is a writer and professor. The author of over forty works, he was awarded the 1963 [[Prix Renaudot]] for his novel ''[[Le Procès-Verbal]]'' and the 2008 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] for his life's work, as an "author of new departures, poetic adventure and sensual ecstasy, explorer of a humanity beyond and below the reigning civilization".<ref name="nobelweb"/>

==Biography==
Le Clézio's mother was born in the [[French Riviera]] city of [[Nice]], his father on the island of [[Mauritius]] (which was a British possession, but his father was ethnically Breton). Both his father's and his mother's ancestors were originally from [[Morbihan]], on the south coast of [[Brittany]].<ref name=geo>

His paternal ancestor François Alexis Le Clézio fled France in 1798 and settled with his wife and daughter on [[Mauritius]], which was then a French colony but would soon pass into British hands. The colonists were allowed to maintain their customs and use of the French language. Le Clézio has never lived in Mauritius for more than a few months at a time, but he has stated that he regards himself both as a Frenchman and a Mauritian.<ref name=roots>{{cite web|url=http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-entertainment/20081207/EU.Sweden.Nobel.Le.Clezio/ |title=Internet might have stopped Hitler |access-date=12 December 2008 |publisher=comcast.net |date=7 December 2008 |quote="Though he was born in France, Le Clézio's father is British and he holds dual nationality with Mauritius, where his family has roots" |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209075618/http://www.comcast.net/articles/news-entertainment/20081207/EU.Sweden.Nobel.Le.Clezio/ |archive-date=9 December 2008 }}</ref><ref>

After several years spent in London and Bristol, he moved to the United States to work as a teacher. During 1967 he served as an aid worker as part of his national service in [[Thailand]], but was quickly expelled from the country for protesting against child prostitution and sent to [[Mexico]] to finish his national service. From 1970 to 1974, he lived with the [[Embera-Wounaan]] tribe in [[Panama]]. He has been married since 1975 to Jémia Jean, who is Moroccan, and has three daughters (one by his first marriage with Rosalie Piquemal).

== Literary career ==
Le Clézio began writing at the age of seven; his first work was a book about the sea. He achieved success at the age of 23, when his first novel, ''[[Le Procès-Verbal]]'' (''The Interrogation''), was the [[Prix Renaudot]] and was shortlisted for the [[Prix Goncourt]].<ref name="times" /> Since then he has published more than thirty-six books, including short stories, novels, essays, two translations on the subject of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] mythology, and several children's books.

From 1963 to 1975, Le Clézio explored themes such as [[insanity]], [[language]], nature and writing. He devoted himself to formal experimentation in the wake of such contemporaries as [[Georges Perec]] or [[Michel Butor]]. His persona was that of an [[innovation|innovator]] and a rebel, for which he was praised by [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Gilles Deleuze]].

During the late 1970s, Le Clézio's style changed drastically; he abandoned experimentation, and the mood of his novels became less tormented as he used themes like [[childhood]], adolescence, and traveling, which attracted a broader audience. In 1980, Le Clézio was the first winner of the newly created Grand Prix [[Paul Morand]], awarded by the [[Académie Française]], for his novel ''Désert''.<ref name=TLS>{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article709674.ece |title=A Frenchman and a geographer |access-date=9 December 2008 |work= 5th paragraph|publisher=review is taken from the TLS |date= 21 April 2006|quote="Le Clezio received the Academie Francaise's Grand Prix Paul Morand in 1980 for Desert, a novel that revealed a move towards a more expansive and lyrical style. The book has a dual narrative. The first, dated 1909–10, chronicles the tragic fate of a Tuareg clan fleeing across Morocco from their French and Spanish colonial oppressors ("les chrétiens")". | location=London | first=Adrian | last=Tahourdin}}</ref> In 1994, a survey conducted by the French literary magazine ''[[Lire (magazine)|Lire]]'' showed that 13 percent of the readers considered him to be the greatest living French language writer.<ref>{{cite web

The [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] for 2008 went to Le Clézio for works characterized by the [[Swedish Academy]] as being "poetic adventure and sensual ecstasy" and for being focused on the environment, especially the desert.<ref name="nobelweb">{{cite web | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2008/| title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 2008 | access-date=2008-10-09 | publisher=Nobelprize.org }}</ref> The [[Swedish Academy]], in announcing the award, called Le Clézio an "author of new departures, poetic adventure and sensual ecstasy, explorer of a humanity beyond and below the reigning civilization."<ref name="post">{{cite news | last =Thompson | first =Bob | title =France's Le Clézio Wins Nobel Literature Prize | newspaper =The Washington Post | date =9 October 2008 | url =https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/09/AR2008100900243.html?hpid=topnews | access-date =2008-10-09 }}</ref> Le Clézio used his Nobel prize acceptance lecture to attack the subject of information poverty.<ref name=lecture>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/dec/08/jmg-clezio-nobel-lecture |title=Le Clézio uses Nobel lecture to attack information poverty |access-date=14 December 2008 |publisher= guardian.co.uk home|date=8 December 2008 | location=London | first=Richard | last=Lea}}</ref> The title of his lecture was ''Dans la forêt des paradoxes'' ("In the forest of paradoxes"), a title he attributed to [[Stig Dagerman]].<ref name=english>{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2008/clezio-lecture_en.html |title=The Nobel Foundation 2008 |access-date=11 December 2008 |author=The Nobel Foundation 2008 |date=7 December 2008 |work=Nobel Lecture |publisher=The Nobel Foundation 2008

[[Gao Xingjian]], a Chinese émigré writing in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], was the previous French citizen to receive the prize (for 2000); Le Clézio was the first French-language writer to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature since [[Claude Simon]] for 1985, and the fourteenth since [[Sully Prudhomme]], laureate of the first prize of 1901.

==Controversy==
He is a staunch defender of Mama Rosa, director of a Mexican shelter raided by the police in July 2014 when children were found eating rotten food and kept against the will of their parents. He wrote an article in ''Le Monde'' arguing that she is close to sanctity.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/idees/article/2014/07/23/plaidoyer-pour-mama-rosa_4461743_3232.html |title=Foyer de l'horreur au Mexique : plaidoyer pour " Mama Rosa " par JMG Le Clézio |newspaper=[[Le Monde]] |date=2014-07-24 |author=JMG Le Clézio }}</ref>
