{{Nihongo|'''Masatoshi Koshiba'''|小柴 昌俊|Koshiba Masatoshi|19 September 1926{{spnd}}12 November 2020}} was a Japanese [[physicist]] and one of the founders of [[neutrino astronomy]]. His work with the neutrino detectors [[Kamiokande]] and [[Super-Kamiokande]] was instrumental in detecting [[solar neutrinos]], providing experimental evidence for the [[solar neutrino problem]].

Koshiba won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 2002 (jointly with [[Raymond Davis Jr.]]) "for pioneering contributions to astrophysics, in particular for the detection of cosmic [[neutrino]]s".

He was a senior counselor at the [[International Center for Elementary Particle Physics]] (ICEPP) and [[professor]] at the University of Tokyo.

== Early life ==
Koshiba was born in [[Toyohashi]] in central Japan on September 19, 1926, to Toshio and Hayako Koshiba. His father was a military officer. His mother died when he was three, leading to his father marrying his wife's elder sister.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|last=Overbye|first=Dennis|date=November 16, 2020|title=Masatoshi Koshiba, 94, Dies; Nobel Winner Tracked Ghostly Neutrinos|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/16/science/masatoshi-koshiba-dead.html|access-date=November 17, 2020|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> He grew up in [[Yokosuka]], and completed his high school in [[Tokyo]]. It is mentioned that his initial interest was in studying [[German literature]], but, ended up studying physics, spurred by a teacher's denigrating comments.<ref name=":2" />

He graduated from the [[University of Tokyo]] in 1951 and received a [[Ph.D.]] in physics from the [[University of Rochester]], New York, in 1955.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":0" />

==Career and research==

Koshiba started his career as a Research Associate at the Department of Physics, [[University of Chicago]] from July 1955 to February 1958, and was an associate professor at Institute of Nuclear Study, University of Tokyo from March 1958 to October 1963. While on leave from November 1959 to August 1962 he served as the acting director, Laboratory of High Energy Physics and Cosmic Radiation, Department of Physics, University of Chicago.<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|last=Yamaguchi|first=Mari|title=Japan Nobel laureate Koshiba who found neutrinos dies at 94|language=en-US|work=The Washington Post|agency=AP|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/japan-nobel-laureate-koshiba-who-found-neutrinos-dies-at-94/2020/11/13/d2fc6cd2-25a7-11eb-9c4a-0dc6242c4814_story.html|access-date=November 17, 2020|issn=0190-8286}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Bio.Masatoshi Koshiba|url=https://jspsusa.org/FORUM2003/bio.koshiba.htm|access-date=November 17, 2020|website=jspsusa.org}}</ref> At the University of Tokyo he became associate professor in March 1963 and then professor in March 1970 in the Department of Physics, Faculty of Science, and emeritus professor there in 1987. From 1987 to 1997, Koshiba taught at [[Tokai University]].<ref name=":0" />

In 2002, he jointly won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for "pioneering contributions to [[astrophysics]], in particular for the detection of cosmic [[neutrino]]s". (The other shares of that year's Prize were awarded to [[Raymond Davis Jr.]] and [[Riccardo Giacconi]] of the U.S.A.)<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2002/ The Nobel Prize in Physics 2002.]</ref>

Koshiba's initial research was in cosmic rays.  In 1969, he shifted into electron-positron collider physics, and was involved with the [[JADE (particle detector)|JADE]] detector in Germany, which helped confirm the Standard Model.  Along with [[Masayuki Nakahata]] and [[Atsuto Suzuki]], Koshiba designed the [[Kamiokande]] experiment to detect [[proton decay]], a prediction of [[grand unified theories]].  No proton decay was detected, but Koshiba realized the detector could be made to detect neutrinos, and adapted the project accordingly, following the pioneering U.S. work of Davis.<ref name=science-obit>{{cite journal |last1=Nakahata|first1=Masayuki |last2=Suzuki |first2=Atsuto |date= 22 Jan 2021|title=Masatoshi Koshiba (1926–2020) |url=https://science.sciencemag.org/content/371/6527/349.full |journal= Science|volume= 371|issue= 6257|pages= 349|doi= 10.1126/science.abg1561 |pmid=33479141 |bibcode=2021Sci...371..349N |access-date=9 Feb 2021|doi-access=free}}</ref>

In the early 1970s, Koshiba collaborated with [[Gersh Budker]] (1918-1977), the particle-accelerator [[electron cooling]] pioneer in the Soviet Union. This collaboration was cut short for unknown reasons but Budker died of heart attack a few years later.<ref name=science-obitPT>{{cite journal |last1=Kajita|first1=Takaaki |last2=Komamiya |first2=Sachio |date= 1 Jul 2021|title=Masatoshi Koshiba |url=https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/PT.3.4800?utm_source=AIP%20Publishing&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=12500307__ALERT_TOPIC_p4390p4390_Particle%20Physics_20210703&dm_i=1XPS,7FXAR,6MRMF7,U8OUK,1 |journal= Physics Today|volume= 74|issue= 7|pages= 60|doi= 10.1063/PT.3.4800  |access-date=5 Jul 2021|doi-access=free}}</ref> 

Through this experiment, he (and Davis in the U.S.) were able to confirm the prediction that neutrinos are generated during the nuclear fusion reaction in the sun. However, these experiments detected fewer neutrinos than had been expected.  This deficit was called the [[solar neutrino problem]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=November 13, 2020|title=Japanese Nobel-prize-winning neutrino pioneer Masatoshi Koshiba dies aged 94|url=https://physicsworld.com/a/japanese-nobel-prize-winning-neutrino-pioneer-masatoshi-koshiba-dies-aged-94/|access-date=November 17, 2020|website=Physics World|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref name=":2" />  The deficit would be eventually explained by "neutrino oscillations", whose existence was confirmed by an enlarged version of Kamiokande, known as [[Super-Kamiokande]], run under the direction of Koshiba's student [[Takaaki Kajita]].<ref name=science-obit/>

In 1987, the Kamiokande experimental detector detected neutrinos from the [[supernova]] explosion (designated [[SN 1987A]]) outside the [[Milky Way]], the [[Large Magellanic Cloud]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Browne|first=Malcolm W.|date=April 7, 1987|title=NEUTRINOS: NEW VIEW INTO SPACE (Published 1987)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/04/07/science/neutrinos-new-view-into-space.html|access-date=November 17, 2020|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref name=":2" /> His research was pioneering in the establishment of [[neutrino astronomy]] as a field of study.<ref name=":2" />

In 1996, with the promising results from Kaokande, the team operationalized a larger and more sensitive detector called [[Super-Kamiokande]]. With this detector, scientists was able to demonstrate strong evidence to prove that neutrinos changed from one type to another of three types during flight. This demonstration resolved the solar neutrino problem with the reasoning being that the early detectors could detect one type of neutrino rather than all three types.<ref>{{Cite web|date=November 13, 2020|title=Nobel Prize laureate remembered for groundbreaking research on neutrinos|url=http://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/nobel-prize-laureate-remembered-for-groundbreaking-research-on-neutrinos-461492/|access-date=November 17, 2020|website=NewsCenter|language=en-US}}</ref>
