== Education and early life ==
Kornberg was born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], the eldest son of biochemist [[Arthur Kornberg]], who won the Nobel Prize, and Sylvy Ruth (Levy) who was also a biochemist. He  earned his [[bachelor's degree]] in [[chemistry]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1967 and his [[Ph.D.]] in [[chemical physics]] from Stanford in 1972 supervised by [[Harden M. McConnell]].<ref name=phd />

==Career==
Kornberg became a [[postdoctoral research]] fellow at the [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]] in Cambridge, England and then an Assistant Professor of Biological Chemistry at Harvard Medical School in 1976, before moving to his present position as Professor of Structural Biology at [[Stanford University School of Medicine|Stanford Medical School]] in 1978.<ref name="Vasmatkar">{{cite book |last1=Vasmatkar |first1=Pashupat |last2=Kamaljit |first2=Kaur |title=Miracles in Biochemistry: The contribution of the Nobel laureates to the field of Biochemistry |date=2019 |publisher=Educreation Publishing |location=India |isbn=978-9388910743 |page=99 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=23WQDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA99 |access-date=8 September 2021}}</ref>

All organisms have genes, which are coded by DNA, which is copied to RNA, which creates [[protein]]s, which are sequences of [[amino acid]]s. DNA resides in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]]. When a cell expresses a gene, it copies ([[transcription (genetics)|transcribes]]) that gene's DNA sequence onto a [[messenger RNA]] (mRNA) sequence. mRNA is transported out of the nucleus to [[ribosome]]s. The ribosomes read the mRNA and [[Translation (genetics)|translate]] the code into the right amino acid sequence to make that gene's protein.<ref name="Pines">{{cite book|first=Alison|last=Davis|chapter=Chapter 2: Cells 101 Business basics |editor-last1=Pines |editor-first1=Maya |title=Inside the cell |date=1990 |publisher=U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, National Institute of General Medical Sciences |location=[Bethesda, Md.?] |isbn=9780160243813 |pages=22–26 |edition=Rev.

The DNA is transcribed to mRNA by an enzyme, [[RNA polymerase II]], with the help of many other proteins. Using [[yeast]], Kornberg identified the role of RNA polymerase II and other proteins in transcribing DNA, and he created three-dimensional images of the protein cluster using [[X-ray crystallography]]. Polymerase II is used by all organisms with nuclei, including humans, to transcribe DNA.<ref name="Hirota">{{cite book |last1=Hirota |first1=Noboru |title=A history of modern chemistry |date=2016 |publisher=Kyoto University Press, Trans Pacific Press |location=Kyoto, Japan |pages=625–626 |isbn=9781920901141 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YOi2SeSVMjsC&pg=PA625 |access-date=8 September 2021}}</ref>

Kornberg and his research group have made several fundamental discoveries concerning the mechanisms and regulation of eukaryotic transcription. While a graduate student working with Harden McConnell at Stanford in the late 1960s, he discovered the "flip-flop" and lateral diffusion of phospholipids in bilayer membranes.  While a postdoctoral fellow working with [[Aaron Klug]] and [[Francis Crick]] at the MRC in the 1970s, Kornberg discovered the [[nucleosome]] as the basic protein complex packaging chromosomal DNA in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells (chromosomal DNA is often termed "[[Chromatin]]" when it is bound to proteins in this manner, reflecting [[Walther Flemming]]'s discovery that certain structures within the cell nucleus would absorb dyes and become visible under a microscope).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kornberg |first1=R. D. |title=Chromatin Structure: A Repeating Unit of Histones and DNA |journal=Science |volume=184 |issue=4139 |year=1974 |pages=868–871 |issn=0036-8075 |doi=10.1126/science.184.4139.868 |pmid=4825889|bibcode=1974Sci...184..868K }}</ref> Within the nucleosome, Kornberg found that roughly 200 bp of DNA are wrapped around an octamer of histone proteins. With Yahli Lorch, Kornberg showed that a nucleosome on a promoter prevents the initiation of transcription, leading to the recognition of a functional role for the nucleosome, which serves as a general gene repressor.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lorch |first1=Yahli |last2=LaPointe |first2=Janice W. |last3=Kornberg |first3=Roger D. |title=Nucleosomes inhibit the initiation of transcription but allow chain elongation with the displacement of histones |journal=Cell |volume=49 |issue=7 |year=1987 |pages=203–210 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(87)90561-7 |pmid=3568125 |s2cid=21270171 }}</ref>

Kornberg's research group at [[Stanford]] later succeeded in the development of a faithful transcription system from [[baker's yeast]], a simple unicellular eukaryote, which they then used to isolate in a purified form all of the several dozen proteins required for the transcription process. Through the work of Kornberg and others, it has become clear that these protein components are remarkably conserved across the full spectrum of eukaryotes, from yeast to human cells.<ref name="Capa">{{cite journal |last1=Capa |first1=Nossa |title=Our Journal Cover |journal=Jornal Brasileiro de Patologia e Medicina Laboratorial |date=2001 |volume=37 |issue=4 |pages=231 |doi=10.1590/S1676-24442001000400001 |url=https://www.scielo.br/j/jbpml/a/Xb79Kg8YPYZMgBXyVg9JtRw/?format=pdf&lang=en |access-date=8 September 2021|doi-access=free }}</ref>

Using this system, Kornberg made the major discovery that transmission of gene regulatory signals to the RNA polymerase machinery is accomplished by an additional protein complex that they dubbed [[Mediator (coactivator)|''Mediator'']].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kelleher |first1=Raymond J. |last2=Flanagan |first2=Peter M. |last3=Kornberg |first3=Roger D. |title=A novel mediator between activator proteins and the RNA polymerase II transcription apparatus |journal=Cell |volume=61 |issue=7 |year=1990 |pages=1209–1215 |issn=0092-8674 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(90)90685-8|pmid=2163759 |s2cid=4971987 }}</ref> As noted by the Nobel Prize committee, "the great complexity of eukaryotic organisms is actually enabled by the fine interplay between tissue-specific substances, enhancers in the DNA and Mediator. The discovery of Mediator is therefore a true milestone in the understanding of the transcription process."<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2006|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2006/kornberg/facts/|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2020-06-01}}</ref>

At the same time as Kornberg was pursuing these biochemical studies of the transcription process, he devoted two decades to the development of methods to visualize the atomic structure of RNA polymerase and its associated protein components. Initially, Kornberg took advantage of expertise with lipid membranes gained from his graduate studies to devise a technique for the formation of two-dimensional protein crystals on lipid bilayers. These 2D crystals could then be analyzed using electron microscopy to derive low-resolution images of the protein's structure. Eventually, Kornberg was able to use [[X-ray crystallography]] to solve the [[protein structure|3-dimensional structure]] of RNA polymerase at atomic resolution.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cramer |first1=P. |title=Structural Basis of Transcription: RNA Polymerase II at 2.8 Angstrom Resolution |journal=Science |volume=292 |issue=5523 |year=2001 |pages=1863–1876 |issn=0036-8075 |doi=10.1126/science.1059493 |pmid=11313498|url=http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1943340/component/escidoc:1943341/1943340.pdf |hdl=11858/00-001M-0000-0015-8729-F |s2cid=4993438 |hdl-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Gnatt |first1=A.

According to the Nobel Prize committee, "the truly revolutionary aspect of the picture Kornberg has created is that it captures the process of transcription in full flow. What we see is an RNA-strand being constructed, and hence the exact positions of the DNA, polymerase and RNA during this process."<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2006/press.html A family story about life] 2006</ref>

=== Lipids membrane ===
As a graduate student at Stanford University, Kornberg's studied the rotation of phospholipids and defined for the first time the dynamics of lipids in the membrane.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kornberg |first1=RD |last2=McConnell |first2=HM |title=Lateral diffusion of phospholipids in a vesicle membrane. |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=October 1971 |volume=68 |issue=10 |pages=2564–8 |doi=10.1073/pnas.68.10.2564 |pmid=4332815|pmc=389469 |bibcode=1971PNAS...68.2564K |doi-access=free }}</ref> Kornberg called the movement of lipid from one leaflet to the other flip-flop because he had studied only a few years before electronic circuit elements called [[Flip-flop (electronics)|flip-flops]]. The term gave rise to the naming of proteins called [[flippase]]s and floppases.<ref name="Epand">{{cite book |last1=Epand |first1=Richard M. |last2=Ruysschaert |first2=Jean-Marie |title=The biophysics of cell membranes : biological consequences |date=September 25, 2017 |publisher=Springer |location=Singapore |isbn=9789811062438 |pages=33–34 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ps3DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA33 |access-date=8 September 2021}}</ref>
