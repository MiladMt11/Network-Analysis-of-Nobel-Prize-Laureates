'''Johann Deisenhofer''' ({{IPA-de|ˈjoːhan ˈdaɪ̯zn̩ˌhoːfɐ|-|De-Johann Deisenhofer.ogg}}; born September 30, 1943) is a German [[biochemist]] who, along with [[Hartmut Michel]] and [[Robert Huber]], received the [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]] in 1988 for their determination of the first crystal structure of an [[integral membrane protein]], a membrane-bound complex of proteins and co-factors that is essential to [[photosynthesis]].<ref name="bio">{{cite book

==Early life and education==
[[Image:Photosynthetic Reaction Center Drawing.png|thumb|right| Schematic of photosynthetic reaction center structure in membrane.]]
Born in Bavaria, Deisenhofer earned his doctorate from the [[Technical University of Munich]] for research work done at the [[Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry]] in [[Martinsried]], [[West Germany]], in 1974. He conducted research there until 1988, when he joined the scientific staff of the [[Howard Hughes Medical Institute]] and the faculty of the Department of [[Biochemistry]] at The [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas]].

==Career==
Together with Michel and Huber, Deisenhofer determined the three-dimensional structure of a [[protein complexes|protein complex]] found in certain photosynthetic bacteria. This membrane protein complex, called a [[photosynthetic reaction center]], was known to play a crucial role in initiating a simple type of photosynthesis. Between 1982 and 1985, the three scientists used [[X-ray crystallography]] to determine the exact arrangement of the more than 10,000 atoms that make up the protein complex. Their research increased the general understanding of the mechanisms of photosynthesis and revealed similarities between the photosynthetic processes of plants and bacteria.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/318618a0| pmid = 22439175| title = Structure of the protein subunits in the photosynthetic reaction centre of Rhodopseudomonas viridis at 3Å resolution| journal = Nature| volume = 318| issue = 6047| pages = 618–624| year = 1985| last1 = Deisenhofer | first1 = J.| author-link1 = Johann Deisenhofer| last2 = Epp | first2 = O.| last3 = Miki | first3 = K.| last4 = Huber | first4 = R.| author-link4 = Robert Huber| last5 = Michel | first5 = H.| author-link5 = Hartmut Michel| bibcode = 1985Natur.318..618D| s2cid = 1551692}}</ref>

Deisenhofer currently serves on the board of advisors of [[Scientists and Engineers for America]], an organization focused on promoting sound science in American government. In 2003 he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the [[Humanism and Its Aspirations|Humanist Manifesto]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III/Notable_Signers |title=Notable Signers |publisher=American Humanist Association |work=Humanism and Its Aspirations |access-date=October 1, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005105825/http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III/Notable_Signers |archive-date=October 5, 2012 }}</ref> He is currently a Professor at the Department of [[Biophysics]] at the [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://profiles.utsouthwestern.edu/profile/11743/johann-deisenhofer.html | title=Johann Deisenhofer, Ph.D. - Faculty Profile - UT Southwestern | access-date=June 24, 2014}}</ref>
