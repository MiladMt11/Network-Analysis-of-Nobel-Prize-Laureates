Semyonov was awarded the 1956 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his work on the mechanism of chemical transformation.

==Life and career==
Semyonov was born in [[Saratov]], the son of Elena Dmitrieva and Nikolai Alex Semyonov.<ref>{{Cite book | url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/nikolai-n-semenov-woc/ |title = Nikolai N. Semenov Summary}}</ref> He graduated from the department of [[physics]] of [[Saint Petersburg State University|Petrograd University]] (1913&ndash;1917), where he was a student of [[Abram Ioffe|Abram Fyodorovich Ioffe]]. In 1918, he moved to [[Samara, Russia|Samara]], where he was enlisted into [[Aleksandr Kolchak|Kolchak]]'s [[White movement|White Army]] during [[Russian Civil War]].

In 1920, he returned to [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] and took charge of the [[electron]] phenomena laboratory of the [[Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute|Petrograd Physico-Technical Institute]].  He also became the vice-director of the institute. In 1921, he married [[philology|philologist]] Maria Boreishe-Liverovsky (student of [[Zhirmunsky]]). She died two years later. In 1923, Nikolay married Maria's niece Natalia Nikolayevna Burtseva. She brought Nikolay a son (Yuri) and a daughter (Lyudmila).

During that difficult time, Semyonov, together with [[Pyotr Kapitsa]], discovered a way to measure the [[magnetic field]] of an [[atomic nucleus]] (1922). Later the experimental setup was improved by [[Otto Stern]] and [[Walther Gerlach]] and became known as [[Stern–Gerlach experiment]].

In 1925, Semyonov, together with [[Yakov Frenkel]], studied [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetics]] of [[condensation]] and [[adsorption]] of [[vapor]]s. In 1927, he studied [[ion]]isation in [[gas]]es and published an important book, ''Chemistry of the Electron''. In 1928, he, together with [[Vladimir Fock]], created a theory of thermal [[disruptive discharge]] of [[dielectric]]s.

He lectured at the [[Petrograd Polytechnical Institute]] and was appointed Professor in 1928. In 1931, he organized the Institute of Chemical Physics of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|USSR Academy of Sciences]] (which moved to [[Chernogolovka]] in 1943) and became its first director. In 1932, he became a full member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.

==Significant works==

Semyonov's outstanding work on the mechanism of chemical transformation includes an exhaustive analysis of the application of the [[chain reaction|chain]] theory to varied reactions (1934&ndash;1954) and, more significantly, to [[combustion]] processes. He proposed a theory of degenerate branching, which led to a better understanding of the phenomena associated with the induction periods of oxidation processes.

Semyonov wrote two important books outlining his work. ''Chemical Kinetics and Chain Reactions'' was published in 1934, with an English edition in 1935. It was the first book in the U.S.S.R. to develop a detailed theory of unbranched and branched chain reactions in chemistry. ''Some Problems of Chemical Kinetics and Reactivity'', first published in 1954, was revised in 1958; there are also English, American, German, and Chinese editions. In 1956, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] (together with Sir [[Cyril Norman Hinshelwood]]) for this work.
