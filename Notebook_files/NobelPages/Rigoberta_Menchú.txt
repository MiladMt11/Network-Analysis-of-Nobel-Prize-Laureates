She lives with her family in the municipality of [[San Pedro Jocopilas]], [[Quiché Department]], northwest of Guatemala City, in the heartland of the Kʼicheʼ people.

==Guatemalan activism==
From a young age, Menchú was active alongside her father, advocating for the rights of Indigenous farmers through the [[Committee for Peasant Unity]].<ref name=":29">{{Cite web|url=https://course-resources.minerva.kgi.edu/uploaded_files/mke/nAXkZr/i-rigoberta-menchu-excerpts.pdf|title=I, Rigoberta Menchu Excerpts|last=Menchu|first=Rigoberta|date=1984}}</ref><ref name=":28" /> Menchú often faced discrimination for wanting to join her male family members in the fight for justice, but she was inspired by her mother to continue making space for herself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tolerance.org/classroom-resources/texts/rigoberta-menchu|title=Rigoberta Menchú|date=2017-08-09|website=Teaching Tolerance|language=en|access-date=2019-12-08}}</ref> She believes that the roots of Indigenous oppression in Guatemala stem from issues of exploitation and colonial land ownership.<ref name=":29" /> Her early activism focused on defending her people from colonial exploitation.<ref name=":29" />

After leaving school, Menchú worked as an activist campaigning against [[human rights]] violations committed by the [[Guatemalan armed forces]] during the country's [[Guatemalan Civil War|civil war]], which lasted from 1960 to 1996.<ref name=":26" /> Many of the human rights violations that occurred during the war targeted Indigenous peoples.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ezpa.library.ualberta.ca/ezpAuthen.cgi?url=https://video.alexanderstreet.com/watch/mayan-indians|title=Mayan Indians|last=ABC Australia|date=2014|website=ezpa.library.ualberta.ca|access-date=2019-12-07}}</ref> Women were targets of physical and sexual violence at the hands of the military.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ezpa.library.ualberta.ca/ezpAuthen.cgi?url=https://brill.com/view/title/23764|title=Come Hell or High Water: Feminism and the Legacy of Armed Conflict in Central America|last=Destrooper|first=Tine|date=2014|website=ezpa.library.ualberta.ca|access-date=2019-12-07}}</ref>

{{Feminism sidebar}}

After the [[Guatemalan Civil War]] ended, Menchú campaigned to have Guatemalan political and military establishment members tried in Spanish courts.<ref name=":21" /> In 1999, she filed a complaint before a court in Spain because prosecutions of civil-war era crimes in Guatemala was practically impossible.<ref name=":21" /> These attempts stalled as the Spanish courts determined that the plaintiffs had not yet exhausted all possibilities of seeking justice through the legal system of Guatemala.<ref name=":21">{{Cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1999/dec/03/news/mn-40132|title=Activist Asks Spain to Pursue Guatemala Case|agency=Reuters|date=1999-12-03|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-10-04|issn=0458-3035}}</ref> On 23 December 2006, Spain called for the [[extradition]] from Guatemala of seven former members of Guatemala's government, including [[Efraín Ríos Montt]] and [[Óscar Humberto Mejía Víctores|Óscar Mejía]], on charges of [[genocide]] and [[torture]].<ref name=":22">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6205327.stm|title=Spain seeks Guatemalan ex-rulers|date=23 December 2006|access-date=27 November 2017|work=BBC News}}</ref> Spain's highest court ruled that cases of genocide committed abroad could be judged in Spain, even if no Spanish citizens were involved.<ref name=":22" /> In addition to the deaths of Spanish citizens, the most serious charges include genocide against the [[Maya people]] of Guatemala.<ref name=":22" />

====Controversies about her testimony====
More than a decade after the publication of ''I, Rigoberta Menchú'', anthropologist [[David Stoll (anthropologist)|David Stoll]] investigated Menchú's story and claimed that Menchú changed some elements about her life, family, and village to meet the publicity needs of the guerrilla movement.<ref name=":27">{{Cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/s/stoll-menchu.html|title=Rigoberta Menchú and the Story of All Poor Guatemalans|website=archive.nytimes.com|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> The controversy caused by Stoll's book received widespread coverage in the US press of the time; thus the ''[[New York Times]]'' highlighted a few claims in her book contradicted by other sources: 

{{Quote|text=A younger brother whom Ms. Menchu says she saw die of starvation never existed, while a second, whose suffering she says she and her parents were forced to watch as he was being burned alive by army troops, was killed in entirely different circumstances when the family was not present. Contrary to Ms. Menchu's assertion in the first page of her book that ''I never went to school'' and could not speak Spanish or read or write until shortly before she dictated the text of ''I, Rigoberta Menchu,'' she in fact received the equivalent of a middle-school education as a scholarship student at two prestigious private boarding schools operated by Roman Catholic nuns.<ref>{{Citation|last=Rohter|first=Larry|title=TARNISHED LAUREATE: A special report; Nobel Winner Finds Her Story Challenged|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=15 December 1998|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100211171327/https://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/15/world/tarnished-laureate-a-special-report-nobel-winner-finds-her-story-challenged.html}}</ref>}}

Many authors have defended Menchú, and attributed the controversy to different interpretations of the testimonio genre.<ref name=":7">{{Cite journal|last=Beverley|first=John|date=1989|title=The Margin at the Center: on "Testimonio" (Testimonial Narrative)|journal=Modern Fiction Studies|volume=35|pages=11–28|doi=10.1353/mfs.0.0923|s2cid=162050347}}</ref><ref>Sanford, Victoria PhD.

The Nobel Committee dismissed calls to revoke Menchú's Nobel Prize, in spite of Stoll's allegations regarding Menchú. [[Geir Lundestad]], the secretary of the committee, stated that Menchú's prize was awarded because of her advocacy and social justice work, not because of her testimony, and that she had committed no observable wrongdoing.

According to Mark Horowitz, William Yaworsky, and Kenneth Kickham, the controversy about Stoll's account of Menchu is one of the three most divisive episodes in recent American anthropological history, along with controversies about the truthfulness of [[Margaret Mead]]'s ''[[Coming of Age in Samoa]]'' and [[Napoleon Chagnon]]'s representation of violence among the [[Yanomami]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/705409|doi = 10.1086/705409|title = Anthropology's Science Wars|year = 2019|last1 = Horowitz|first1 = Mark|last2 = Yaworsky|first2 = William|last3 = Kickham|first3 = Kenneth|journal = Current Anthropology|volume = 60|issue = 5|pages = 674–698|s2cid = 203051445}}</ref>
