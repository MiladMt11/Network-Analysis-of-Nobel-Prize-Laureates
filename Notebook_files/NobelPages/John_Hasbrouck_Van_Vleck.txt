'''John Hasbrouck Van Vleck''' (March 13, 1899 – October 27, 1980) was an [[Americans|American]] [[physicist]] and [[mathematician]]. He was co-awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1977, for his contributions to the understanding of the behavior of [[electron]]s in [[magnetic]] [[solid]]s.

==Education and early life==
Born in [[Middletown, Connecticut]], the son of mathematician [[Edward Burr Van Vleck]] and grandson of astronomer [[John Monroe Van Vleck]], he grew up in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], and received an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] [[academic degree|degree]] from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1920. Then he went to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] for graduate studies and earned a [[Ph.D]] [[Academic degree|degree]] in 1922 under the supervision of [[Edwin C. Kemble]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1977/vleck/biographical/ |title=John H. van Vleck Biographical}} </ref>

==Career and research==
He joined the [[University of Minnesota]] as an assistant [[professor]] in 1923, then moved to the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] before settling at Harvard. He also earned ''[[Honorary Degree|Honorary]] D. Sc.'', or ''D. [[Honoris Causa]]'', degree from [[Wesleyan University]] in 1936.<ref>{{Nobelprize}} including the Nobel Lecture, December 8, 1977 ''Quantum Mechanics The Key to Understanding Magnetism''</ref>

J. H. Van Vleck established the fundamentals of the [[quantum mechanical]] theory of [[magnetism]], [[crystal field theory]] and [[ligand field theory]] ([[chemical bonding]] in [[complex (chemistry)|metal complexes]]). He is regarded as the ''Father of Modern [[Magnetism]]''.<ref>[http://www.iaqms.org/deceased/van-vleck.php John H. van Vleck], International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science.</ref><ref>[http://www.tc.umn.edu/~janss011/pdf%20files/dispersion-I.pdf ''On the verge of Umdeutung in Minnesota: Van Vleck and the correspondence principle.

During [[World War II]], J. H. Van Vleck worked on [[radar]] at the [[MIT]] [[Radiation Lab]]. He was half time at the [[Radiation Lab]] and half time on the staff at [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. He showed that at about 1.25-centimeter [[wavelength]] [[water molecule]]s in the [[atmosphere]] would lead to troublesome [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] and that at 0.5-centimeter [[wavelength]] there would be a similar [[Absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] by [[oxygen]] [[molecules]].<ref>[http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Norman_F._Ramsey_Oral_History_(1991) ''Norman F.

This was to have important consequences not just for military (and civil) [[radar system]]s but later for the new science of [[radioastronomy]].

J. H. Van Vleck participated in the [[Manhattan Project]]. In June [[Timeline of World War II (1942)|1942]], [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] held a summer study for confirming the concept and feasibility of a [[nuclear weapon]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Eight theoretical scientists, including J. H. Van Vleck, attended it. From July to September, the theoretical study group examined and developed the principles of [[atomic bomb]] design.<ref>[http://www.lanl.gov/history/atomicbomb/gadget-born.shtml ''New Weapons Laboratory Gives Birth to the "Gadget"''], 50th Anniversary Article, Los Alamos National Laboratory.</ref><ref>[http://www.atomicheritage.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=296 ''Berkeley Summer Study Group''], The Atomic Heritage Foundation.</ref><ref>[http://www.atomicheritage.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=287 ''Atomic History Timeline 1900– 1942 ''], The Atomic Heritage Foundation.</ref>

J. H. Van Vleck's theoretical work led to the establishment of the [[Los Alamos Nuclear Weapons Laboratory]]. He also served on the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] Review committee in 1943. The committee, established by General [[Leslie R. Groves|Leslie Groves]], also consisted of [[Warren K. Lewis|W. K. Lewis]] of [[MIT]], Chairman; E. L. Rose, of Jones & Lamson; [[Edgar Bright Wilson|E. B. Wilson]] of [[Harvard]]; and [[Richard C. Tolman]], Vice Chairman of [[National Defense Research Committee|NDRC]].  The committee's important contribution (originating with Rose) was a reduction in the size of the firing gun for the [[Little Boy]] atomic bomb, a concept that eliminated additional design weight and sped up production of the bomb for its eventual release over [[Hiroshima]]. However, it was not employed for the [[Fat Man]] bomb at [[Nagasaki]], which relied on implosion of a plutonium shell to reach critical mass.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lanl.gov/history/road/oversight.shtml |title=Oversight Committee Formed as Lab Begins Research – 50th Anniversary Article, Los Alamos National Laboratory }}</ref><ref>[[Leslie R. Groves]], Lieutenant General, U.S. Army, Retired; ''Now It Can Be Told'', Harper, 1962, pp. 162–63.</ref>  

The philosopher and historian of science [[Thomas Kuhn]] completed a Ph.D. in physics under van Vleck's supervision at Harvard.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Road Since Structure: Philosophical Essays, 1970-1993, with an Autobiographical Interview|url=https://archive.org/details/roadsincestructu00kuhn|url-access=limited|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2000|isbn=9780226457987|editor-last=Conant|editor-first=Jim|pages=[https://archive.org/details/roadsincestructu00kuhn/page/n248 242]–245|editor-last2=Haugeland|editor-first2=John}}</ref>

In 1950 he became foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00003578 |title=John Hasbrouck van Vleck (1899–1980) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |access-date=17 July 2015}}</ref> He was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]] in 1966<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/nms/recip_details.cfm?recip_id=371 |title=The President's National Medal of Science: Recipient Details |publisher= National Science Foundation}}</ref> and the [[Lorentz Medal]] in 1974.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/lorentzmedal/ |title= The Lorentz medal |publisher=Lorentz.leidenuniv.nl |access-date=2012-07-27}}</ref>
For his contributions to the understanding of the behavior of [[electron]]s in [[magnetic]] [[solids]], Van Vleck was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] 1977, along with [[Philip Warren Anderson|Philip W. Anderson]] and Sir [[Nevill Mott]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1977/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1977 |publisher= Nobelprize.org |access-date=2012-07-27}}</ref> Van Vleck transformations, [[Van Vleck paramagnetism]] and [[Quantum chaos|Van Vleck formula]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Chaos in classical and quantum mechanics|last=C.)|first=Gutzwiller, M.

Van Vleck died in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], aged 81.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1980/10/28/archives/john-van-vleck-nobel-laureate-known-for-work-on-magnetism-earned.html?sq=John%2520Van%2520Vleck&scp=1&st=cse |title=John Van Vleck, Nobel Laureate Known for Work on Magnetism; Earned Three Degree |newspaper= The New York Times |date=October 28, 1980 |page= A32}}</ref>

==Awards and honors==
He was awarded the [[Irving Langmuir Award]] in 1965, the  [[National Medal of Science]] in 1966 and elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1967|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1967]].<ref name=frs/> He was awarded the [[Elliott Cresson Medal]] in 1971, the [[Lorentz Medal]] in 1974 and the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1977.

==Personal life==
J. H. Van Vleck and his wife Abigail were also important art collectors, particularly in the medium of Japanese woodblock prints (principally ''[[Ukiyo-e]]''), known as ''Van Vleck Collection''. It was inherited from his father [[Edward Burr Van Vleck]].  They [[donated]] it to the [[Chazen Museum of Art]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] in 1980s.<ref>[http://www.chazen.wisc.edu/collection/prints/vleck.htm ''E. B.
