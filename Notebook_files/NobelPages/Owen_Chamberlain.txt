'''Owen Chamberlain''' (July 10, 1920 &ndash; February 28, 2006) was an American [[physicist]] who shared with [[Emilio Segrè]] the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for the discovery of the [[antiproton]], a [[sub atomic particle|sub-atomic]] [[antiparticle]].<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Jaros, John |author2=Nagamiya, Shoji |author3=Steiner, Herbert |title=Obituary: Owen Chamberlain|journal=Physics Today|date=August 2006|volume=59|issue=8|pages=70–72|doi=10.1063/1.2349741|bibcode = 2006PhT....59h..70J |doi-access=free}}</ref>

Born in [[San Francisco, California]], Chamberlain graduated from [[Germantown Friends School]] in Philadelphia in 1937. He studied physics at [[Dartmouth College]], where he was a member of [[Alpha Theta]] chapter of [[Theta Chi]] fraternity, and at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He remained in school until the start of [[World War II]], and joined the [[Manhattan Project]] in 1942, where he worked with Segrè, both at Berkeley and in [[Los Alamos, New Mexico|Los Alamos]], [[New Mexico]]. He married Beatrice Babette Copper (d. 1988) in 1943, with whom he had four children.<ref>Sanders, Robert (March 1, 2006).

In 1946, after the war, Chamberlain continued with his doctoral studies at the [[University of Chicago]] under physicist [[Enrico Fermi]].<ref>Yarris, Lynn (March 1, 2006). [http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/Chamberlain-obit.html Berkeley Scientific Great Owen Chamberlain Has Died]. www.lbl.gov (March 1, 2006)</ref>  Fermi acted as an important guide and mentor for Chamberlain, encouraging him to leave behind [[theoretical physics]] for [[experimental physics]], for which Chamberlain had a particular aptitude. Chamberlain received his [[Ph.D.]] from the University of Chicago in 1949.

In 1948, having completed his experimental work, Chamberlain returned to Berkeley as a member of its faculty. There he, Segrè, and other physicists investigated proton-proton scattering. In 1955, a series of proton scattering experiments at Berkeley's [[Bevatron]] led to the discovery of the anti-proton, a particle like a proton but negatively charged. Chamberlain's later research work included the [[time projection chamber]] (TPC), and work at the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]] (SLAC).

Chamberlain was politically active on issues of peace and social justice, and outspoken against the [[Vietnam War]]. He was a member of Scientists for Sakharov, Orlov, and Shcharansky, three physicists of the former [[Soviet Union]] imprisoned for their political beliefs. In the 1980s, he helped found the [[nuclear freeze]] movement. In 2003 he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the [[Humanism and Its Aspirations|Humanist Manifesto]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III/Notable_Signers | title=Notable Signers | publisher=American Humanist Association | work=Humanism and Its Aspirations | access-date=September 15, 2012}}</ref>

Chamberlain was diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]] in 1985, and retired from teaching in 1989. He died of complications from the disease on February 28, 2006, in Berkeley at the age of 85.

Chamberlain plays a central role in [[Jacob M. Appel]]'s [[Sherwood Anderson Foundation|Sherwood Anderson Award]]-winning short story, "Measures of Sorrow".<ref>Appel, JM. (2015) ''Miracles and Conundrums of the Secondary Planets'', Black Lawrence Press.</ref>
