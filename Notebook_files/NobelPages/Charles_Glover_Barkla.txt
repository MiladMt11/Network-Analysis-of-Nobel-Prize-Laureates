==Life==
Barkla was born in [[Widnes]], [[England]], to John Martin Barkla, a secretary for the Atlas Chemical Company, and Sarah Glover, daughter of a watchmaker.

Barkla studied at the [[Liverpool Institute for Boys|Liverpool Institute]] and proceeded to [[Liverpool University]] with a County Council Scholarship and a Bibby Scholarship. Barkla initially studied Mathematics but later specialised in Physics under Sir [[Oliver Lodge]]. During the absence of Oliver Lodge due to ill health, Barkla replaced him in lectures.<ref>{{citation |title=Notable Scientists from 1900 to the Present |volume=A-C |page=[https://archive.org/details/notablescientist0005unse/page/129 129] |isbn=0787617520 |quote=Barkla studied experimental physics under Oliver Lodge, for whom he occasionally substituted as lecturer. |author=Brigham Narins |year=2001 |url=https://archive.org/details/notablescientist0005unse/page/129 }}</ref>

In 1899 Barkla was admitted to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], with an [[1851 Research Fellowship]] from the [[Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851]],<ref>1851 Royal Commission Archives</ref> to work in the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] under the physicist [[J. J. Thomson]] (discoverer of the electron). During his first two years at Cambridge, under the directions of Thomson, Barkla studied the velocity of electromagnetic waves along wires of different widths and materials.

After a year and a half at Trinity College, Cambridge, his love of music led him to transfer to [[King's College, Cambridge]], in order to sing in their [[Choir of King's College, Cambridge|chapel choir]]. Barkla's voice was of remarkable beauty and his solo performances were always fully attended.<ref>{{citation |title=Notable Scientists from 1900 to the Present |volume=A-C |page=[https://archive.org/details/notablescientist0005unse/page/129 129] |isbn=0787617520 |quote=Barkla had an excellent voice (said to be either baritone or bass according to various biographers) which drew crowds for his solo performances. |author=Brigham Narins |year=2001 |url=https://archive.org/details/notablescientist0005unse/page/129 }}</ref>  He completed his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in 1903, and then his [[Master of Arts]] degree in 1907.<ref>{{acad|id=BRKL899CG|name=Barkla, Charles Glover}}</ref> He married Mary Esther Cowell in the same year,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=30 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919152306/https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf |archive-date=19 September 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> with whom he had two sons and one daughter.

In 1913, after having worked at the Universities of Cambridge, Liverpool, and [[King's College London]], Barkla was appointed as a Professor of [[Natural Philosophy]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1913, a position that he held until his death.

Barkla made significant progress in developing and refining the laws of X-ray scattering, [[X-ray spectroscopy]], the principles governing the transmission of X-rays through matter, and especially the principles of the excitation of secondary X-rays. For his discovery of the characteristic X-rays of elements, Barkla was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1917. He was also awarded the [[Hughes Medal]] of the British [[Royal Society]] that same year.

Barkla proposed the J-phenomenon as a hypothetical form of [[X-ray]] behaviour similar to [[X-ray fluorescence]] but other scientists were not persuaded that this was a different mechanism from other known effects such as [[Compton scattering]] and so the theory was not successful.<ref name=BW>{{citation |last=Wynne |first=Brian |title=C.

From 1922 to 1938 he lived at Hermitage of Braid in south-west Edinburgh.<ref>Plaque to Barkla, Hermitage of Braid</ref>

He died in Edinburgh on 23 October 1944.

==Public recognition==

The [[lunar crater]] [[Barkla (crater)|Barkla]] was named in the honour of Charles Barkla. 

A plaque exists on Barkla's house at Hermitage of Braid in Edinburgh. A commemorative plaque has been installed in the vicinity of the Canongate, near the Faculty of Education Buildings, at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. Additionally, a lecture theatre at the [[University of Liverpool]]'s Physics department, as well as a Biophysics laboratory in the Biological science department,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/biophysics/Barkla.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110152219/http://www.liv.ac.uk/biophysics/Barkla.html |archive-date=10 November 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref> are named after him. In 2012 a [[gritter]] in Barkla's home town of [[Widnes]] was named in his honour, following a competition run by the local newspaper.<ref>[https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2058-7058/25/02/1 "A gritter named Barkla"] Physics World Volume 25 Number 02, February 2012</ref>
