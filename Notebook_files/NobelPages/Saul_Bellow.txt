'''Saul Bellow''' (born '''Solomon Bellows'''; 10 June 1915 – 5 April 2005) was a Canadian-born American writer. For his literary work, Bellow was awarded the [[Pulitzer Prize]], the [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize for Literature]], and the [[National Medal of Arts]].<ref>[http://www-news.uchicago.edu/resources/arts/ University of Chicago accolades – National Medal of Arts].

In the words of the Swedish [[Nobel Committee]], his writing exhibited "the mixture of rich [[picaresque]] novel and subtle analysis of our culture, of entertaining adventure, drastic and tragic episodes in quick succession interspersed with philosophic conversation, all developed by a commentator with a witty tongue and penetrating insight into the outer and inner complications that drive us to act, or prevent us from acting, and that can be called the dilemma of our age."<ref name="nobelprize">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1976/press.html|title=Nobel Prize in Literature 1976 – Press Release |publisher=nobelprize.org|access-date=26 August 2015}}</ref> His best-known works include ''[[The Adventures of Augie March]],'' ''[[Henderson the Rain King]]'', ''[[Herzog (novel)|Herzog]]'', ''[[Mr. Sammler's Planet]]'', ''[[Seize the Day (novel)|Seize the Day]]'', ''[[Humboldt's Gift]]'' and ''[[Ravelstein]]''. Bellow was regarded as an important author of 20th century American literature.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/arts/1023266.stm  Obituary: Saul Bellow] BBC News, Tuesday, 5 April 2005</ref>

This transcendence of the "unutterably dismal" (a phrase from ''[[Dangling Man]]'') is achieved, if it can be achieved at all, through a "ferocious assimilation of learning" (Hitchens) and an emphasis on nobility.

Bellow celebrated his birthday in June, although he may have been born in July (in the Jewish community, it was customary to record the Hebrew date of birth, which does not always coincide with the Gregorian calendar).<ref>''The New York Times'' obituary, 6 April 2005. "...his birthdate is listed as either June or July 10, 1915, though his lawyer, Mr. Pozen, said yesterday that Mr. Bellow customarily celebrated in June. (Immigrant Jews at that time tended to be careless about the Christian calendar, and the records are inconclusive.)"</ref> Of his family's emigration, Bellow wrote: {{quote|The retrospective was strong in me because of my parents. They were both full of the notion that they were falling, falling. They had been prosperous cosmopolitans in Saint Petersburg. My mother could never stop talking about the family [[dacha]], her privileged life, and how all that was now gone. She was working in the kitchen. Cooking, washing, mending ... There had been servants in Russia ... But you could always transpose from your humiliating condition with the help of a sort of embittered irony.<ref>Saul Bellow, ''It All Adds Up'', first published 1994, Penguin edition 2007, pp. 295–96.</ref>}}

A period of illness from a respiratory infection at age eight both taught him self-reliance (he was a very fit man despite his sedentary occupation) and provided an opportunity to satisfy his hunger for reading: reportedly, he decided to be a writer when he first read [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]'s ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]].''

When Bellow was nine, his family moved to the [[Humboldt Park, Chicago|Humboldt Park]] neighborhood on the [[West Side, Chicago|West Side]] of Chicago, the city that formed the backdrop of many of his novels.<ref name=NYTobit /> Bellow's father, Abraham, had become an onion importer. He also worked in a bakery, as a coal delivery man, and as a bootlegger.<ref name=NYTobit /> Bellow's mother, Liza, died when he was 17.

===Education and early career===
Bellow attended the [[University of Chicago]] but later transferred to [[Northwestern University]]. He originally wanted to study literature, but he felt the English department was anti-Jewish. Instead, he graduated with honors in [[anthropology]] and sociology.<ref>''The New York Times'' obituary, 6 April 2005. "He had hoped to study literature but was put off by what he saw as the tweedy anti-Semitism of the English department, and graduated in 1937 with honors in anthropology and sociology, subjects that were later to instill his novels."</ref> It has been suggested Bellow's study of anthropology had an influence on his literary style, and anthropological references pepper his works.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Bellow later did graduate work at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]].

Paraphrasing Bellow's description of his close friend [[Allan Bloom]] (see ''[[Ravelstein]]''), [[John Podhoretz]] has said that both Bellow and Bloom "inhaled books and ideas the way the rest of us breathe air."<ref name="timesonline">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article379354.ece |title=Saul Bellow, a neocon's tale |newspaper=timesonline.co.uk|access-date=26 August 2015}}</ref>

In the 1930s, Bellow was part of the Chicago branch of the [[Works Progress Administration]] Writer's Project, which included such future Chicago literary luminaries as [[Richard Wright (author)|Richard Wright]] and [[Nelson Algren]]. Many of the writers were radical: if they were not members of the [[Communist Party USA]], they were sympathetic to the cause. Bellow was a [[Trotskyism|Trotskyist]], but because of the greater numbers of [[Stalinism|Stalinist]]-leaning writers he had to suffer their taunts.<ref>Drew, Bettina. ''Nelson Algren, A Life on the Wild Side.'' Austin: University of Texas Press, 1991</ref>

In 1941 Bellow became a [[naturalized]] US citizen, after discovering upon attempting to enlist in the armed forces that he had immigrated to the United States illegally as a child.<ref>

In 1943, [[Maxim Lieber]] was his literary agent.

During [[World War II]], Bellow joined the [[United States Merchant Marine|merchant marine]] and during his service he completed his first novel, ''[[Dangling Man]]'' (1944) about a young Chicago man waiting to be drafted for the war.

From 1946 through 1948 Bellow taught at the [[University of Minnesota]]. In the fall of 1947, following a tour to promote his novel ''[[The Victim (novel)|The Victim]]'', he moved into a large old house at 58 Orlin Street SE in the [[Prospect Park, Minneapolis|Prospect Park]] neighborhood of [[Minneapolis]].<ref name="Leader 2015 p.">{{cite book|title=The Life of Saul Bellow: to fame and fortune, 1915–1964|last=Leader|first=Zachary|publisher=Alfred A.

In 1948, Bellow was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] that allowed him to move to Paris, where he began writing ''[[The Adventures of Augie March]]'' (1953). Critics have remarked on the resemblance between Bellow's [[picaresque novel]] and the great 17th Century Spanish classic ''[[Don Quixote]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pinsker|first=Sanford|date=April 1973|title=Saul Bellow in the Classroom|journal=College English|volume=34|issue=7|pages=980|jstor=375232|doi=10.2307/375232}}</ref> The book starts with one of American literature's most famous opening paragraphs,<ref name="npr">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2005/04/08/4583405/saul-bellow-an-appreciation|title=Saul Bellow, An Appreciation : NPR|publisher=npr.org|access-date=26 August 2015}}</ref> and it follows its titular character through a series of careers and encounters, as he lives by his wits and his resolve. Written in a colloquial yet philosophical style, ''The Adventures of Augie March'' established Bellow's reputation as a major author.

In 1958, Bellow once again taught at the University of Minnesota. During this time, he and his wife Sasha received psychoanalysis from University of Minnesota Psychology Professor [[Paul Meehl]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Menand |first=Louis |date=11 May 2015 |title=Young Saul |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/05/11/young-saul |magazine= The New Yorker |location= New York, NY|access-date= 18 October 2016}}</ref>

One of his students was [[William Kennedy (author)|William Kennedy]], who was encouraged by Bellow to write fiction.

===Return to Chicago and mid-career===
Bellow lived in New York City for years, but returned to Chicago in 1962 as a professor at the Committee on Social Thought at the [[University of Chicago]]. The committee's goal was to have professors work closely with talented graduate students on a multi-disciplinary approach to learning. Bellow taught on the committee for more than 30 years, alongside his close friend, the philosopher [[Allan Bloom]].

There were also other reasons for Bellow's return to Chicago, where he moved into the [[Hyde Park, Chicago|Hyde Park]] neighborhood with his third wife, Susan Glassman. Bellow found Chicago vulgar but vital, and more representative of America than New York.<ref>The New York Times Book Review, 13 December 1981</ref> He was able to stay in contact with old high school friends and a broad cross-section of society. In a 1982 profile, Bellow's neighborhood was described as a high-crime area in the city's center, and Bellow maintained he had to live in such a place as a writer and "stick to his guns."<ref>''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', March 1982</ref>

Bellow hit the bestseller list in 1964 with his novel ''[[Herzog (novel)|Herzog]]''. Bellow was surprised at the commercial success of this cerebral novel about a middle-aged and troubled college professor who writes letters to friends, scholars and the dead, but never sends them. Bellow returned to his exploration of mental instability, and its relationship to genius, in his 1975 novel ''[[Humboldt's Gift]]''. Bellow used his late friend and rival, the brilliant but self-destructive poet [[Delmore Schwartz]], as his model for the novel's title character, Von Humboldt Fleisher.<ref name=Atlas>Atlas, James. ''Bellow: A Biography.'' New York: Random House, 2000.</ref> Bellow also used [[Rudolf Steiner]]'s spiritual science, anthroposophy, as a theme in the book, having attended a study group in Chicago. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1969.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=30 May 2011}}</ref>

===Nobel Prize and later career===
Propelled by the success of ''Humboldt's Gift'', Bellow won the Nobel Prize in literature in 1976. In the 70-minute address he gave to an audience in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], Bellow called on writers to be beacons for civilization and awaken it from intellectual torpor.<ref name=Atlas />

The following year, the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] selected Bellow for the [[Jefferson Lecture]], the U.S. federal government's highest honor for achievement in the [[humanities]]. Bellow's lecture was entitled "The Writer and His Country Look Each Other Over."<ref name="jefflect">[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/jefflect.html Jefferson Lecturers] at NEH Website. Retrieved 22 January 2009.</ref>

From December 1981 to March 1982, Bellow was the Visiting Lansdowne Scholar at the [[University of Victoria]] (B.C.),<ref>{{cite web|title=Visiting Lansdowne scholar, Saul Bellow|url=http://archives.library.uvic.ca/hpc/index.php/visiting-lansdowne-scholar-saul-bellow;rad|website=University of Victoria Archives|access-date=14 June 2015}}</ref> and also held the title Writer-in-Residence.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Colombo|first1=John Robert|title=Canadian Literary Landmarks|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WdPnEvbEKgQC&pg=PA283|publisher=Dundum|page=283|isbn=9781459717985|date=January 1984}}</ref> In 1998, he was elected to the [[American Philosophical Society]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=APS Member History|url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=Saul+Bellow&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced|access-date=2021-12-02|website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref>

Bellow traveled widely throughout his life, mainly to Europe, which he sometimes visited twice a year.<ref name=Atlas /> As a young man, Bellow went to [[Mexico City]] to meet [[Leon Trotsky]], but the expatriate Russian revolutionary was assassinated the day before they were to meet. Bellow's social contacts were wide and varied. He tagged along with [[Robert F. Kennedy]] for a magazine profile he never wrote, and was close friends with the author [[Ralph Ellison]]. His many friends included the journalist [[Sydney J. Harris]] and the poet [[John Berryman]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/05/27/archives/john-berryman-friend.html|title=John Berryman, Friend|last=Bellow|first=Saul|date=27 May 1973|work=The New York Times}}</ref>

While sales of Bellow's first few novels were modest, that turned around with ''[[Herzog (novel)|Herzog]]''. Bellow continued teaching well into his old age, enjoying its human interaction and exchange of ideas. He taught at [[Yale University]], [[University of Minnesota]], [[New York University]], [[Princeton University]], [[University of Puerto Rico]], [[University of Chicago]], [[Bard College]] and [[Boston University]], where he co-taught a class with [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]] ('modestly absenting himself' when it was time to discuss ''Seize the Day''). In order to take up his appointment at Boston, Bellow moved in 1993 from Chicago to [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], where he died on 5 April 2005, at age 89. He is buried at the Jewish cemetery Shir HeHarim of [[Brattleboro]], [[Vermont]].

While he read voluminously, Bellow also played the violin and followed sports. Work was a constant for him, but he at times toiled at a plodding pace on his novels, frustrating the publishing company.<ref name=Atlas />

His early works earned him the reputation as a major novelist of the 20th century, and by his death he was widely regarded as one of the greatest living novelists.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/10/fiction.saulbellow 'He was the first true immigrant voice'] The Observer, Sunday 10 April 2005</ref> He was the first writer to win three National Book Awards in all award categories.<ref name=winners>[http://www.nationalbook.org/nbawinners_category.html "National Book Award Winners: 1950–2009"]. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved 12 March 2012.<!-- unofficial count. Our [[List of winners of the National Book Award]] may be easier to search efficiently --></ref> His friend and protege [[Philip Roth]] has said of him, "The backbone of 20th-century American literature has been provided by two novelists—[[William Faulkner]] and Saul Bellow. Together they are the Melville, Hawthorne, and Twain of the 20th century." [[James Wood (critic)|James Wood]], in a eulogy of Bellow in ''[[The New Republic]]'', wrote:<ref>Wood, James, 'Gratitude', ''New Republic'', 00286583, 25 April 2005, Vol. 232, Issue 15</ref>

{{quote|I judged all modern prose by his. Unfair, certainly, because he made even the fleet-footed—the Updikes, the DeLillos, the Roths—seem like monopodes. Yet what else could I do? I discovered Saul Bellow's prose in my late teens, and henceforth, the relationship had the quality of a love affair about which one could not keep silent. Over the last week, much has been said about Bellow's prose, and most of the praise—perhaps because it has been overwhelmingly by men—has tended toward the robust: We hear about Bellow's mixing of high and low registers, his Melvillean cadences jostling the jivey Yiddish rhythms, the great teeming democracy of the big novels, the crooks and frauds and intellectuals who loudly people the brilliant sensorium of the fiction. All of this is true enough; John Cheever, in his journals, lamented that, alongside Bellow's fiction, his stories seemed like mere suburban splinters. Ian McEwan wisely suggested last week that British writers and critics may have been attracted to Bellow precisely because he kept alive a Dickensian amplitude now lacking in the English novel. ... But nobody mentioned the beauty of this writing, its music, its high lyricism, its firm but luxurious pleasure in language itself. ... [I]n truth, I could not thank him enough when he was alive, and I cannot now.}}

==Personal life ==
Bellow was married five times, with all but his last marriage ending in divorce. His son Greg by his first became a psychotherapist; he published ''Saul Bellow's Heart: A Son's Memoir'' in 2013, nearly a decade after his father's death.<ref name=Woods>{{cite magazine|last1=Woods|first1=James|title=Sins of the Fathers: Do great novelists make bad parents?|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/07/22/sins-of-the-father|magazine=The New Yorker|access-date=30 December 2014|date=22 July 2013}}</ref> Bellow's son by his second marriage, [[Adam Bellow|Adam]], published a nonfiction book ''In Praise of Nepotism'' in 2003. Bellow's wives were Anita Goshkin, Alexandra (Sondra) Tsachacbasov, Susan Glassman, [[Alexandra Bellow|Alexandra Ionescu Tulcea]], and Janis Freedman. In 2000, when he was 84, Bellow had his fourth child and first daughter, with Freedman.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/oct/10/saul-bellow-letters-janis-interview "Saul Bellow's widow on his life and letters: 'His gift was to love and be loved'", by Rachel Cooke, ''The Guardian'']</ref>

==Themes and style==
[[File:Saul Bellow.jpg|thumb|Illustrated portrait of Bellow by [[Zoran Tucić]]]]
The author's works speak to the disorienting nature of modern civilization, and the countervailing ability of humans to overcome their frailty and achieve greatness (or at least awareness). Bellow saw many flaws in modern civilization, and its ability to foster madness, materialism and misleading knowledge.<ref>Malin, Irving. ''Saul Bellow's Fiction''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 1969</ref> Principal characters in Bellow's fiction have heroic potential, and many times they stand in contrast to the negative forces of society. Often these characters are Jewish and have a sense of alienation or otherness.

Jewish life and identity is a major theme in Bellow's work, although he bristled at being called a "Jewish writer". Bellow's work also shows a great appreciation of America, and a fascination with the uniqueness and vibrancy of the American experience.

Bellow's work abounds in references and quotes from [[Marcel Proust]] and [[Henry James]], among others, but he offsets these high-culture references with jokes.<ref name=NYTobit /> Bellow interspersed autobiographical elements into his fiction, and many of his principal characters were said to bear a resemblance to him.

==Assessment==
{{Overquotation|section|date=June 2019}}
[[Martin Amis]] described Bellow as "The greatest American author ever, in my view".<ref>[http://www.identitytheory.com/interviews/birnbaum135.php Martin Amis  Author of Yellow Dog talks with Robert Birnbaum] 8 December 2003, by Robert Birnbaum</ref>
{{quote| His sentences seem to weigh more than anyone else's. He is like a force of nature ... He breaks all the rules ...

Author of Yellow Dog talks with Robert Birnbaum, ''Identity Theory'', 8 December 2003, by Robert Birnbaum</ref>}}

For [[Linda Grant]], "What Bellow had to tell us in his fiction was that it was worth it, being alive."
{{quote|His vigour, vitality, humour and passion were always matched by the insistence on thought, not the predigested cliches of the mass media or of those on the left, which had begun to disgust him by the Sixties ... It's easy to be a 'writer of conscience'—anyone can do it if they want to; just choose your cause. Bellow was a writer about conscience and consciousness, forever conflicted by the competing demands of the great cities, the individual's urge to survival against all odds and his equal need for love and some kind of penetrating understanding of what there was of significance beyond all the racket and racketeering.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/apr/10/fiction.saulbellow 'He was the first true immigrant voice'] Linda Grant, ''The Observer'', Sunday 10 April 2005</ref>}}

On the other hand, Bellow's detractors considered his work conventional and old-fashioned, as if the author were trying to revive the 19th-century European novel. In a private letter, [[Vladimir Nabokov]] described Bellow as a "miserable mediocrity".<ref>Wood, James (1 February 1990) [http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/biography/0,,99383,00.html "Private Strife".] ''Guardian Unlimited''.</ref> Journalist and author [[Ron Rosenbaum]] described Bellow's ''[[Ravelstein]]'' (2000) as the only book that rose above Bellow's failings as an author. Rosenbaum wrote,

{{quote| My problem with the pre-Ravelstein Bellow is that he all too often strains too hard to yoke together two somewhat contradictory aspects of his being and style. There's the street-wise Windy City wiseguy and then—as if to show off that the wiseguy has Wisdom—there are the undigested chunks of arcane, not entirely impressive, philosophic thought and speculation. Just to make sure you know his novels have intellectual heft. That the world and the flesh in his prose are both figured and transfigured.<ref>Rosenbaum, Ron. "Saul Bellow and the Bad Fish". ''Slate''. 3 April 2007</ref>}}

[[Sam Tanenhaus]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' in 2007:

{{quote|But what, then, of the many defects—the longueurs and digressions, the lectures on anthroposophy and religion, the arcane reading lists? What of the characters who don't change or grow but simply bristle onto the page, even the colorful lowlifes pontificating like fevered students in the seminars Bellow taught at the University of Chicago? And what of the punitively caricatured ex-wives drawn from the teeming annals of the novelist's own marital discord?}}

But Tanenhaus went on to answer his question:
{{quote|Shortcomings, to be sure. But so what? Nature doesn't owe us perfection. Novelists don't either. Who among us would even recognize perfection if we saw it? In any event, applying critical methods, of whatever sort, seemed futile in the case of an author who, as Randall Jarrell once wrote of Walt Whitman, 'is a world, a waste with, here and there, systems blazing at random out of the darkness'—those systems 'as beautifully and astonishingly organized as the rings and satellites of Saturn.'<ref>Tanenhaus, Sam (4 February 2007) "Beyond Criticism." ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''.</ref> }}

[[V. S. Pritchett]] praised Bellow, finding his shorter works to be his best. Pritchett called Bellow's novella ''Seize the Day'' a "small gray masterpiece."<ref name=NYTobit />

==Political views==
As he grew older, Bellow moved decidedly away from leftist politics and became identified with cultural conservatism.<ref name=Atlas /><ref>[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2536835 Review: The Joan Peters Case], Edward W. Said, ''Journal of Palestine Studies'', '''15''':2 (Winter, 1986), pp. 144–150. Retrieved 27 March 2008.</ref> His opponents included [[feminism]], campus activism and [[postmodernism]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www-personal.umich.edu/~hfc/mideast/newmccarthy.pdf |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20051020122516/http://www-personal.umich.edu/~hfc/mideast/newmccarthy.pdf |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2005-10-20 |title= The New American McCarthyism: policing thought about the Middle East }}</ref> Bellow also thrust himself into the often contentious realm of Jewish and African-American relations.<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com">Ahmed, Azam and Ron Grossman (5 October 2007) [https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2007-10-05-0710050150-story.html "Bellow's remarks on race haunt legacy in Hyde Park."] ''Chicago Tribune.''</ref> Bellow was critical of [[multiculturalism]] and according to [[Alfred Kazin]] once said: "Who is the [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] of the [[Zulu people|Zulus]]? The [[Marcel Proust|Proust]] of the [[New Guinea|Papuans]]? I'd be glad to read him."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-06-19/features/9406190395_1_saul-bellow-janis-freedman-keith-botsford/2 |title=Bellow's Latest Chapter |author=John Blades |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=19 June 1994 |access-date=1 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.newcriterion.com/print/article/10322 | title=Mr. Bellow's planet by Dominic Green published in the New Criterion November 2018}}</ref> Bellow distanced himself somewhat from these remarks, which he characterized as "off the cuff obviously and pedantic certainly." He, however, stood by his criticism of multiculturalism, writing:
{{quote|In any reasonably open society, the absurdity of a petty thought-police campaign provoked by the inane magnification of "discriminatory" remarks about the Papuans and the Zulus would be laughed at. To be serious in this fanatical style is a sort of Stalinism – the Stalinist seriousness and fidelity to the party line that senior citizens like me remember all too well.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/04/23/specials/bellow-papuans.html |title=Papuans and Zulus |author=Saul Bellow |magazine=New York Times Book Review |date=10 March 1994 |access-date=10 June 2015}}</ref>}}

Despite his identification with Chicago, he kept aloof from some of that city's more conventional writers. In a 2006 interview with ''Stop Smiling'' magazine, [[Studs Terkel]] said of Bellow: "I didn't know him too well. We disagreed on a number of things politically. In the protests in the beginning of [[Norman Mailer]]'s ''Armies of the Night'', when Mailer, [[Robert Lowell]] and [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]] were marching to protest the [[Vietnam War]], Bellow was invited to a sort of counter-gathering. He said, 'Of course I'll attend'. But he made a big thing of it. Instead of just saying OK, he was proud of it. So I wrote him a letter and he didn't like it. He wrote me a letter back. He called me a [[Stalinist]]. But otherwise, we were friendly. He was a brilliant writer, of course. I love ''Seize the Day''."

Attempts to name a street after Bellow in his Hyde Park neighborhood were halted by a local alderman on the grounds that Bellow had made remarks about the neighborhood's inhabitants that they considered racist.<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/> A one-block stretch of West Augusta Boulevard in [[Humboldt Park, Chicago|Humboldt Park]] was named Saul Bellow Way in his honor instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/lifestyles/books/ct-saul-bellow-100th-birthday-20150604-column.html|title=Walking through Saul Bellow's Chicago|first=Christopher|last=Borrelli|access-date=26 May 2018}}</ref>
