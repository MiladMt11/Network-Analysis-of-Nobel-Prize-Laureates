'''Alan Jay Heeger''' (born January 22, 1936) is an American [[physicist]], [[academic]] and [[Nobel Prize laureate]] [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|in chemistry]].

Heegar was elected as a member into the [[National Academy of Engineering]] in 2002 for co-founding the field of conducting polymers and for pioneering work in making these novel materials available for technological applications.

==Life and career==
Heeger was born in [[Sioux City, Iowa]], to a Jewish family.  He grew up in [[Akron, Iowa]], where his father owned a general store.  At age nine, following his father's death, the family moved to Sioux City.<ref>{{cite web | title = Alan Heeger - Biographical | publisher =  Nobel Foundation | url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2000/heeger-bio.html | access-date = 3 April 2015}}</ref>

Heeger earned a B.S. in physics and mathematics from the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]] in 1957, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]] in physics from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1961.  From 1962 to 1982 he was on the faculty of the [[University of Pennsylvania]]. In 1982 he commenced his present appointment as a professor in the [[UC Santa Barbara Physics Department|Physics Department]] and the Materials Department at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. His research has led to the formation of numerous start-up companies including Uniax, [[Konarka]], and Sirigen, founded in 2003 by [[Guillermo C. Bazan]], Patrick J. Dietzen, Brent S. Gaylord. Alan Heeger was a founder of Uniax, which was acquired by [[DuPont]].

He won the [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]] in 2000 along with [[Alan G. MacDiarmid]] and [[Hideki Shirakawa]] "for their discovery and development of [[conductive polymers]];" They published their results on [[polyacetylene]] a [[conductive polymer]] in 1977.<ref name="HMacSh">{{Cite journal|doi=10.1039/C39770000578|title=Synthesis of electrically conducting organic polymers: Halogen derivatives of polyacetylene, (CH) x|year=1977|last1=Shirakawa|first1=Hideki|last2=Louis|first2=Edwin J.|last3=MacDiarmid|first3=Alan G.|last4=Chiang|first4=Chwan K.|last5=Heeger|first5=Alan J.|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Chemical Communications|issue=16|pages=578|url=http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA041866|access-date=2018-04-29|archive-date=2017-09-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925014126/http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=ADA041866|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="nob">{{cite web | url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2000/ | title = The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2000: Alan Heeger, Alan G.

He had won the [[Oliver E. Buckley Condensed Matter Prize|Oliver E. Buckley Prize]] of the [[American Physical Society]] in 1983 and, in 1995, the [[Balzan Prize]] for Science of Non-Biological Materials.

His sons are the [[neuroscientist]] [[David Heeger]] and the immunologist Peter Heeger.

In October 2010, Heeger participated in the [[USA Science and Engineering Festival]]'s Lunch with a Laureate program where middle and high school students engage in an informal conversation with a Nobel Prize-winning scientist over a brown-bag lunch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usasciencefestival.org/2010festival/schoolprograms/lunchwithalaureate |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-12-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421005023/http://www.usasciencefestival.org/2010festival/schoolprograms/lunchwithalaureate |archive-date=2010-04-21 }}</ref> Heeger is also a member of the [[USA Science and Engineering Festival]]'s Advisory Board.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usasciencefestival.org/about/advisors |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-04-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421005310/http://www.usasciencefestival.org/about/advisors/ |archive-date=2010-04-21 }}</ref> Heeger has been a judge of the [[Scientists, Technologists and Artists Generating Exploration|''STAGE'']] International Script Competition three times (2006, 2007, 2010).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stage.cnsi.ucsb.edu/competition/judges/|title=''STAGE'' Judges|access-date=25 October 2011}}</ref>

"Perhaps the greatest pleasure of being a scientist is to have an abstract idea, then to do an experiment (more often a series of experiments is required) that demonstrates the idea was correct; that is, Nature actually behaves as conceived in the mind of the scientist. This process is the essence of creativity in science. I have been fortunate to have experienced this intense pleasure many times in my life."
