'''Carl Gustaf Verner von Heidenstam''' (6 July 1859 – 20 May 1940) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[poet]], [[novelist]] and [[laureate]] of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1916.<ref>Stork, Charles Wharton (1916). "Verner von Heidenstam," ''The Nation'', Vol. CIII, No. 2683, p. 509.</ref> He was a member of the [[Swedish Academy]] from 1912.<ref>Warme, Lars G. (1996). ''A History of Swedish Literature''. University of Nebraska Press, p. 276.</ref> His poems and prose work are filled with a great joy of life, sometimes imbued with a love of [[History of Sweden|Swedish history]] and scenery, particularly its physical aspects.

==Life==

=== Early years ===
[[File:Olshammar huvudbyggnaden.JPG|thumb|Von Heidenstam's birthplace at Olshammar, now [[Olshammarsgården]]]]
Verner von Heidenstam was born in [[Olshammar]], [[Örebro County]] on 6 July 1859 to a [[Nobility|noble family]]. Von Heidenstam was the son of [[Gustaf von Heidenstam]], an engineer, and ''Magdalena'' Charlotta von Heidenstam ([[née]] Rütterskiöld).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Von Heidenstam nr 2025 - Adelsvapen-Wiki|url=https://www.adelsvapen.com/genealogi/Von_Heidenstam_nr_2025|access-date=2021-10-10|website=www.adelsvapen.com}}</ref> He was educated at ''Beskowska skolan'' in [[Stockholm]].

He studied painting in the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts|Academy of Stockholm]], but soon left because of ill health. He then traveled extensively in [[Europe]], [[Africa]] and the orient.<ref>Sohrabi, Bahram (2005). "Early Swedish Travelers to Persia," ''Iranian Studies'' '''38''' (4), pp. 631–660.</ref> 

== Literary career ==
He was at once greeted as a poet of promise on the publication of his first collection of poems,{{sfn|Hartmann|1920}} ''Vallfart och vandringsår'' (''Pilgrimage: the Wander Years'', 1888). It is a collection of poems inspired by his experiences in the orient and marks an abandonment of naturalism that was dominant then in [[Swedish literature]].

His love for beauty is also shown by the long narrative poem ''Hans Alienus ''(1892). ''Dikter'' ("Poems", 1895) and ''Karolinerna'' (''The Charles Men'', 2 vols., 1897–1898), a series of historical portraits of King [[Charles XII of Sweden]] and his cavaliers, shows a strong nationalistic passion.<ref>[[Michelle Facos|Facos, Michelle]] (1998). ''Nationalism and the Nordic Imagination: Swedish Art of the 1890s''. University of California Press, p. 63.</ref><ref>Barton, H. Arnold (2002). "The Silver Age of Swedish National Romanticism, 1905-1920," ''Scandinavian Studies'' '''74''' (4), pp. 505–520.</ref> English translations of short stories from ''Karolinerna'' can be found in the ''American-Scandinavian Review'' (New York), May 1914, November 1915, and July 1916.{{sfn|Hartmann|1920}} The two volumes of ''Folkunga Trädet'' (''The Tree of the Folkungs'', 1905–07) are the inspired, epic story of a clan of Swede chieftains in the Middle Ages.

In 1910 a controversy was waged in Swedish newspapers between a number of Swedish literary men on the topic of the proletarian “degradation” of literature, the protagonists of the two opposing camps being [[August Strindberg]] and Heidenstam. Professors Lidforss and Böök also took part. Heidenstam's chief contribution was the pamphlet, directed chiefly against Strindberg, "Proletärfilosofiens upplösning och fall" ("The Decline and Fall of the Proletarian Philosophy").<ref>Gustafson, Alrik (1940). "Nationalism Reinterpeted: Verner von Heidenstam." In: ''Six Scandinavian Novelists''. New York: Biblo & Tannen, p. 169.</ref>

Heidenstam's poetical collection ''Nya Dikter'', published in 1915, deals with philosophical themes, mainly concerning the elevation of man to a better humanity from solitude.
