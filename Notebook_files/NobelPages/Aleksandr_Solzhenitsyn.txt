One of the most famous [[Soviet dissident]]s, Solzhenitsyn was an outspoken critic of [[communism]] and helped to raise global awareness of [[political repression in the Soviet Union]] (USSR), in particular the [[Gulag]] system.

Solzhenitsyn was born into a family that defied the [[USSR anti-religious campaign (1921–1928)]] and remained devout members of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. While still young, Solzhenitsyn lost his faith in [[Christianity]] and became a firm believer in both [[atheism]] and [[Marxism–Leninism]]; in his later life, he gradually became a philosophically-minded Eastern Orthodox Christian as a result of his experience in prison and the camps. While serving as a captain in the [[Red Army]] during [[World War II]], Solzhenitsyn was arrested by the [[SMERSH]] and sentenced to eight years in the Gulag and then [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|internal exile]] for criticizing Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] in a private letter.

As a result of the [[Khrushchev Thaw]], Solzhenitsyn was released and exonerated, and he returned to the Christian faith of his childhood and pursued writing novels about repressions in the [[Soviet Union]] and his experiences. He published his first novel, ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]'' in 1962, with approval from Soviet leader [[Nikita Khrushchev]], which was an account of Stalinist repressions. Solzhenitsyn's last work to be published in the Soviet Union was ''[[Matryona's Place]]'' in 1963. Following the removal of Khrushchev from power, the Soviet authorities attempted to discourage him from continuing to write. Solzhenitsyn continued to work on further novels and their publication in other countries including ''[[Cancer Ward]]'' in 1968, ''[[August 1914 (novel)|August 1914]]'' in 1971, and ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' in 1973 outraged the Soviet authorities, and Solzhenitsyn lost his Soviet citizenship in 1974 and was flown to [[West Germany]]. In 1976, he moved with his family to the United States, where he continued to write. In 1990, shortly before the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], his citizenship was restored, and four years later he returned to Russia, where he remained until his death in 2008.

He was awarded the 1970 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] "for the ethical force with which he has pursued the indispensable traditions of Russian literature",<ref name="Noble">{{cite web|url= http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1970/ |title=Nobel Prize in Literature 1970|publisher=Nobel Foundation | access-date =17 October 2008}}</ref> and ''The Gulag Archipelago'' was a highly influential work that "amounted to a head-on challenge to the Soviet state", and sold tens of millions of copies.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Scammell |first1=Michael |title=The Writer Who Destroyed an Empire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/opinion/solzhenitsyn-soviet-union-putin.html |work=The New York Times |date=11 December 2018 |quote=In 1973, still in the Soviet Union, he sent abroad his literary and polemical masterpiece, 'The Gulag Archipelago.'

Solzhenitsyn's gesture amounted to a head-on challenge to the Soviet state, calling its very legitimacy into question and demanding revolutionary change.}}</ref>

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===

Solzhenitsyn was born in [[Kislovodsk]] (now in [[Stavropol Krai]], Russia). His mother, Taisiya Zakharovna (née Shcherbak), was of Ukrainian and his father of Russian descent.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.segodnya.ua/world/alekcandr-colzhenitsyn-chelovek-i-arkhipelah-120568.html | script-title=ru:Александр Солженицын: человек и архипелаг | language = ru |trans-title=Alexander Solzhenitsyn: A man and Archipelago | place = [[Ukraine|UA]] | publisher = Segodnya | date = 4 August 2008 | access-date = 14 February 2010}}</ref> Her father had risen from humble beginnings to become a wealthy landowner, acquiring a large estate in the [[Kuban]] region in the northern foothills of the [[Caucasus]].<ref>[[#Scammell|Scammell]], p. 30</ref> During World War I, Taisiya went to Moscow to study. While there she met and married Isaakiy Semyonovich Solzhenitsyn, a young officer in the [[Imperial Russian Army]] of [[Cossacks|Cossack]] origin and fellow native of the Caucasus region. The family background of his parents is vividly brought to life in the opening chapters of ''August 1914'', and in the later ''[[The Red Wheel|Red Wheel]]'' novels.<ref>[[#Scammell|Scammell]], pp. 26–30</ref>

In 1918, Taisiya became pregnant with Aleksandr.  On 15 June, shortly after her pregnancy was confirmed, Isaakiy was killed in a hunting accident.  Aleksandr was raised by his widowed mother and his aunt in lowly circumstances.  His earliest years coincided with the [[Russian Civil War]]. By 1930 the family property had been turned into a [[kolkhoz|collective farm]]. Later, Solzhenitsyn recalled that his mother had fought for survival and that they had to keep his father's background in the old Imperial Army a secret.  His educated mother (who never remarried) encouraged his literary and scientific learnings and raised him in the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] faith;<ref>O'Neil, Patrick M. (2004) ''Great world writers: 20th century'', p. 1400. Marshall Cavendish, {{ISBN|978-0-7614-7478-4}}</ref><ref>[[#Scammell|Scammell]], pp. 25–59</ref> she died in 1944.<ref>[[#Scammell|Scammell]], p. 129</ref>

As early as 1936, Solzhenitsyn began developing the characters and concepts for a planned epic work on [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Revolution]]. This eventually led to the novel ''August 1914''; some of the chapters he wrote then still survive.{{citation needed| date= May 2011}} Solzhenitsyn studied mathematics and physics at [[Southern Federal University|Rostov State University]]. At the same time he took correspondence courses from the Moscow Institute of Philosophy, Literature and History, at this time heavily ideological in scope.  As he himself makes clear, he did not question the state ideology or the superiority of the Soviet Union until he spent time in the camps.<ref>{{Citation| title = The Gulag Archipelago | chapter = Part II, Chapter 4}}</ref>

=== World War II ===

During the war, Solzhenitsyn served as the commander of a [[Artillery sound ranging|sound-ranging]] battery in the [[Red Army]],<ref>[[#Scammell|Scammell]], p. 119</ref> was involved in major action at the front, and was twice decorated.  He was awarded the [[Order of the Red Star]] on 8 July 1944 for sound-ranging two German artillery batteries and adjusting counterbattery fire onto them, resulting in their destruction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pamyat-naroda.ru/heroes/podvig-chelovek_nagrazhdenie19998084/|script-title=ru:Документ о награде :: Солженицын Александр Исаевич, Орден Красной Звезды|website=pamyat-naroda.ru|language=ru|trans-title=Award document : Solzhenitsyn Aleksandr Isayevich, Order of the Red Star|access-date=28 April 2016}}</ref>

A series of writings published late in his life, including the early uncompleted novel ''Love the Revolution!'', chronicle his wartime experience and growing doubts about the moral foundations of the Soviet regime.<ref>{{Citation | last = Solzhenitsyn | first = Aleksandr Isaevich | title = Протеревши глаза: сборник (Proterevshi glaza: sbornik) | language = ru |trans-title=Proterevshi eyes: compilation | place = Moscow | publisher =  Nash dom; L'Age d'Homme | year = 1999}}</ref>

While serving as an artillery officer in [[East Prussia]], Solzhenitsyn witnessed [[Soviet war crimes#Germany|war crimes against local German civilians]] by Soviet military personnel. Of the atrocities, Solzhenitsyn wrote: "You know very well that we've come to Germany to take our revenge" for [[War crimes of the Wehrmacht|Nazi atrocities committed in the Soviet Union]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hartmann |first1=Christian |title=Operation Barbarossa: Nazi Germany's War in the East, 1941–1945 |date=2013 |publisher=OUP Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-163653-0 |pages=127–128}}</ref> The noncombatants and the elderly were robbed of their meager possessions and [[Rape during the occupation of Germany|women and girls were gang-raped]]. A few years later, in the forced labor camp, he memorized a poem titled "[[Prussian Nights]]" about a woman raped to death in East Prussia. In this poem, which describes the gang-rape of a [[Poles|Polish]] woman whom the [[Red Army]] soldiers mistakenly thought to be a German,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=De Zayas|first=Alfred M.|date=January 2017|title=Review: Prussian Nights|journal=The Review of Politics|volume=40|issue=1|pages=154–156|jstor=1407101}}</ref> the first-person narrator comments on the events with sarcasm and refers to the responsibility of official Soviet writers like [[Ilya Ehrenburg]].

In ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'', Solzhenitsyn wrote, "There is nothing that so assists the awakening of omniscience within us as insistent thoughts about one's own transgressions, errors, mistakes. After the difficult cycles of such ponderings over many years, whenever I mentioned the heartlessness of our highest-ranking bureaucrats, the cruelty of our executioners, I remember myself in my Captain's shoulder boards and the forward march of my battery through East Prussia, enshrouded in fire, and I say: 'So were ''we'' any better?'"<ref>Ericson, p. 266.</ref>

=== Imprisonment ===

In February 1945, while serving in [[East Prussia]], Solzhenitsyn was arrested by [[SMERSH]] for writing derogatory comments in private letters to a friend, Nikolai Vitkevich,<ref name="isbn1-933859-57-1">[[#Ericon2008|Ericson (2008)]] p. 10</ref> about the conduct of the war by [[Joseph Stalin]], whom he called "[[Khozyain]]" ("the boss"), and "Balabos" ([[Yiddish dialects|Yiddish]] rendering of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''baal ha-bayit'' for "master of the house").<ref>[[#Moody|Moody]], p. 6</ref> He also had talks with the same friend about the need for a new organization to replace the Soviet regime.<ref>Solzhenitsyn in Confession – SFU's Summit http://summit.sfu.ca/system/files/iritems1/8379/etd3261.pdf page 26</ref>{{clarify|How did the exchange come to SMERSH attention?|date=February 2020}}

He was accused of anti-Soviet propaganda under [[Article 58]] paragraph 10 of the Soviet criminal code, and of "founding a hostile organization" under paragraph 11.<ref>[[#Scammell|Scammell]], pp. 152–54</ref><ref>{{Citation| last1 = Björkegren| first1 = Hans| last2 = Eneberg| first2 = Kaarina| year = 1973

On 9 May 1945, it was announced that Germany had surrendered and all of Moscow broke out in celebrations with fireworks and searchlights illuminating the sky to celebrate the victory in the Great Patriotic War. From his cell in the Lubyanka, Solzhenitsyn remembered: "Above the muzzle of our window, and from all the other cells of the Lubyanka, and from all the windows of the Moscow prisons, we too, former prisoners of war and former front-line soldiers, watched the Moscow heavens, patterned with fireworks and crisscrossed with beams of searchlights. There was no rejoicing in our cells and no hugs and no kisses for us. That victory was not ours."<ref>Pearce (2011) p. 87</ref> On 7 July 1945, he was sentenced in his absence by [[Special Council of the NKVD]] to an eight-year term in a [[Labor camp|labour camp]].  This was the normal sentence for most crimes under Article 58 at the time.<ref>[[#Moody|Moody]], p. 7</ref>

The first part of Solzhenitsyn's sentence was served in several work camps; the "middle phase", as he later referred to it, was spent in a ''[[sharashka]]'' (a special scientific research facility run by Ministry of State Security), where he met [[Lev Kopelev]], upon whom he based the character of Lev Rubin in his book ''[[The First Circle]]'', published in a self-censored or "distorted" version in the West in 1968 (an English translation of the full version was eventually published by Harper Perennial in October 2009).<ref>{{Citation| last = Solzhenitsyn| first = Aleksandr I.| url = http://www.harpercollins.com/books/9780061479014/In_the_First_Circle/ | title = In the First Circle| publisher = Harper Collins

During his imprisonment at the camp in the town of [[Ekibastuz]] in Kazakhstan, he worked as a miner, bricklayer, and foundry foreman. His experiences at Ekibastuz formed the basis for the book ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]''.  One of his fellow political prisoners, [[Ion Moraru]], remembers that Solzhenitsyn spent some of his time at Ekibastuz writing.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.romanism.net/tag/sabia-dreptatii |title=Organizatia anti-sovietica "Sabia Dreptatii" |language=ro |trans-title=Anti-Soviet organization "Sword of Justice" |publisher=Romanism |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809121325/http://romanism.ro/tag/sabia-dreptatii |archive-date=9 August 2011}}</ref> While there Solzhenitsyn had a tumor removed. His cancer was not diagnosed at the time.

In March 1953, after his sentence ended, Solzhenitsyn was sent to internal exile for life at [[Birlik, Kazakhstan|Birlik]],<ref>According to 9th MGB order of 27 December 1952 № 9 / 2-41731.</ref> a village in [[Baydibek District|Baidibek District]] of [[South Kazakhstan]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lgPwzq0M9lkC&q=solzhenitsyn+betpak+dala&pg=PT44|title=Solzhenitsyn: A Soul in Exile|last=Pearce|first=Joseph|publisher=Ignatius Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-58617-496-5|quote=they were being exiled "in perpetuity" to the district of Kok-Terek}}</ref> His undiagnosed cancer spread until, by the end of the year, he was close to death. In 1954, he was permitted to be treated in a hospital in [[Tashkent]], where his tumor went into remission. His experiences there became the basis of his novel ''[[Cancer Ward]]'' and also found an echo in the short story "The Right Hand." It was during this decade of imprisonment and exile that Solzhenitsyn abandoned [[Marxism]] and developed the philosophical and religious positions of his later life, gradually becoming a philosophically-minded Eastern Orthodox Christian as a result of his experience in prison and the camps.<ref>{{Citation| title = The Gulag Archipelago | chapter = Part IV}}</ref><ref>{{Citation| first = Daniel J.| last = Mahoney| title = Hero of a Dark Century| newspaper = National Review| date = 1 September 2008| pages = 47–50}}</ref><ref>"Beliefs" in [[#Ericon2008|Ericson (2008)]] pp. 177–205</ref> He repented for some of his actions as a Red Army captain, and in prison compared himself to the perpetrators of the Gulag. His transformation is described at some length in the fourth part of ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' ("The Soul and Barbed Wire"). The narrative poem ''The Trail'' (written without benefit of pen or paper in prison and camps between 1947 and 1952) and the 28 poems composed in prison, forced-labour camp, and exile also provide crucial material for understanding Solzhenitsyn's intellectual and spiritual odyssey during this period. These "early" works, largely unknown in the West, were published for the first time in Russian in 1999 and excerpted in English in 2006.<ref>{{Citation| last = Solzhenitsyn| year = 1999 | title = Протеревши глаза: сборник (Proterevshi glaza: sbornik) |trans-title=Proterevshi eyes compilation | place = Moscow| publisher = Nash dom—L'age d'Homme}}</ref><ref>[[#Ericson2009|Ericson (2009)]]</ref>

=== Marriages and children ===

On 7 April 1940, while at the university, Solzhenitsyn married Natalia Alekseevna Reshetovskaya.<ref>{{Citation | last = Terras | first = Victor | year = 1985 | title = Handbook of Russian Literature | page = 436 | publisher = Yale University Press | isbn = 978-0-300-04868-1}}</ref> They had just over a year of married life before he went into the army, then to the Gulag. They divorced in 1952, a year before his release, because wives of Gulag prisoners faced loss of work or residence permits. After the end of his internal exile, they remarried in 1957,<ref>[[#Scammell|Scammell]], p. 366</ref> divorcing a second time in 1972. Reshetovskaya wrote negatively of Solzhenitsyn in her memoirs, accusing him of having affairs, and said of the relationship that "[Solzhenitsyn]'s despotism ... would crush my independence and would not permit my personality to develop."<ref>{{cite news|last=Rourke|first=Mary|date=6 June 2003|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-jun-06-me-reshetovskaya6-story.html|title=Natalya Reshetovskaya, 84; Twice Married to Alexander Solzhenitsyn|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=13 August 2021}}</ref>

=== After prison ===

After [[Khrushchev's Secret Speech]] in 1956, Solzhenitsyn was freed from exile and [[Rehabilitation (Soviet)|exonerated]]. Following his return from exile, Solzhenitsyn was, while teaching at a secondary school during the day, spending his nights secretly engaged in writing. In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech he wrote that "during all the years until 1961, not only was I convinced I should never see a single line of mine in print in my lifetime, but, also, I scarcely dared allow any of my close acquaintances to read anything I had written because I feared this would become known."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/literature/laureates/1970/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041204155242/http://nobelprize.org/literature/laureates/1970/ |url-status=dead |archive-date= 4 December 2004 |year=1970 |title=Laureates |work=Literature |publisher=Nobel prize |access-date=14 February 2010 }}</ref>

In 1960, aged 42, he approached [[Aleksandr Tvardovsky]], a poet and the chief editor of the ''Novy Mir'' magazine, with the manuscript of ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]''. It was published in edited form in 1962, with the explicit approval of [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who defended it at the presidium of the Politburo hearing on whether to allow its publication, and added: "There's a Stalinist in each of you; there's even a Stalinist in me. We must root out this evil."<ref>{{Citation | last = Benno | first = Peter | year = 1965 | chapter = The Political Aspect | editor1-first = Max | editor1-last = Hayward | editor2-first = Edward L | editor2-last = Crowley | title = Soviet Literature in the 1960s | place = London | page = 191}}</ref> The book quickly sold out and became an instant hit.<ref name=Wachtel2013>{{cite journal|last=Wachtel|first=Andrew|year=2013|title=''One Day''—Fifty years later|journal=Slavic Review|volume=72|issue=1|pages=102–117|doi=10.5612/slavicreview.72.1.0102|jstor=10.5612/slavicreview.72.1.0102|s2cid=164632244}}{{limited access}}</ref> In the 1960s, while he was publicly known to be writing ''Cancer Ward'', he was simultaneously writing ''The Gulag Archipelago''. During Khrushchev's tenure, ''One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' was studied in schools in the Soviet Union, as were three more short works of Solzhenitsyn's, including his short story "[[Matryona's Place|Matryona's Home]]", published in 1963. These would be the last of his works published in the Soviet Union until 1990.

''One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich'' brought the Soviet system of prison labour to the attention of the West.  It caused as much of a sensation in the Soviet Union as it did in the West—not only by its striking realism and candor, but also because it was the first major piece of Soviet literature since the 1920s on a politically charged theme, written by a non-party member, indeed a man who had been to Siberia for "libelous speech" about the leaders, and yet its publication had been officially permitted. In this sense, the publication of Solzhenitsyn's story was an almost unheard of instance of free, unrestrained discussion of politics through literature. However, after Khrushchev had been ousted from power in 1964, the time for such raw exposing works came to an end.<ref name=Wachtel2013 />

Solzhenitsyn made an unsuccessful attempt, with the help of Tvardovsky, to have his novel ''Cancer Ward'' legally published in the Soviet Union. This required the approval of the [[USSR Union of Writers|Union of Writers]]. Though some there appreciated it, the work was ultimately denied publication unless it was to be revised and cleaned of suspect statements and anti-Soviet insinuations.<ref>{{Citation | title = The Oak and the Calf| title-link = The Oak and the Calf}}</ref>

After Khrushchev's removal in 1964, the cultural climate again became more repressive. Publishing of Solzhenitsyn's work quickly stopped; as a writer, he became a [[non-person]], and, by 1965, the [[KGB]] had seized some of his papers, including the manuscript of ''The First Circle''. Meanwhile, Solzhenitsyn continued to secretly and feverishly work on the most well-known of his writings, ''The Gulag Archipelago''.  The seizing of his novel manuscript first made him desperate and frightened, but gradually he realized that it had set him free from the pretenses and trappings of being an "officially acclaimed" writer, a status which had become familiar but which was becoming increasingly irrelevant.

After the KGB had confiscated Solzhenitsyn's materials in Moscow, during 1965–67, the preparatory drafts of ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'' were turned into finished typescript in hiding at his friends' homes in [[Soviet Estonia]]. Solzhenitsyn had befriended [[Arnold Susi]], a lawyer and former Minister of Education of [[Estonia]] in a [[Lubyanka Building]] prison cell. After completion, Solzhenitsyn's original handwritten script was kept hidden from the KGB in Estonia by Arnold Susi's daughter [[Heli Susi]] until the collapse of the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite book|title=Art of the Baltics: The Struggle for Freedom of Artistic Expression Under the Soviets, 1945–1991|last1 =Rosenfeld|first1 =Alla| first2=Norton T | last2 = Dodge|year= 2001 | publisher = Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0-8135-3042-0|pages=55, 134 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=r73fmcC5itkC}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title= Invisible Allies| last = Solzhenitsyn| first = Aleksandr I | year = 1995| publisher= Basic Books| isbn = 978-1-887178-42-6 | pages =46–64 | chapter = The Estonians|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=5yYBZ35HPo4C}}</ref>

In 1969, Solzhenitsyn was expelled from the Union of Writers. In 1970, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. He could not receive the prize personally in [[Stockholm]] at that time, since he was afraid he would not be let back into the Soviet Union. Instead, it was suggested he should receive the prize in a special ceremony at the Swedish embassy in Moscow.  The Swedish government refused to accept this solution because such a ceremony and the ensuing media coverage might upset the Soviet Union and damage Swedish-Soviet relations. Instead, Solzhenitsyn received his prize at the 1974 ceremony after he had been expelled from the Soviet Union.

''The Gulag Archipelago'' was composed from 1958 to 1967, and  has sold over thirty million copies in thirty-five languages. It was a three-volume, seven-part work on the Soviet prison camp system, which drew from Solzhenitsyn's experiences and the testimony of 256<ref>{{citation | title = The Gulag Archipelago | chapter = Ekaterinburg: U-Faktoriia}}</ref> former prisoners and Solzhenitsyn's own research into the history of the Russian penal system.  It discusses the system's origins from the founding of the Communist regime, with [[Vladimir Lenin]] having responsibility, detailing interrogation procedures, prisoner transports, prison camp culture, prisoner uprisings and revolts such as the [[Kengir uprising]], and the practice of internal [[exile]]. [[Soviet and Communist studies]] historian and archival researcher [[Stephen G. Wheatcroft]] wrote that the book was essentially a "literary and political work", and "never claimed to place the camps in a historical or social-scientific quantitative perspective" but that in the case of qualitative estimates, Solzhenitsyn gave his high estimate as he wanted to challenge the Soviet authorities to show that "the scale of the camps was less than this."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wheatcroft|first=Stephen|author-link=Stephen G.

On 8 August 1971, the [[KGB]] allegedly attempted to assassinate Solzhenitsyn using an unknown chemical agent (most likely [[ricin]]) with an experimental gel-based delivery method.<ref>{{cite book |title = The First Directorate |last = Kalugin |first = Oleg |year = 1994 |publisher = Diane |page = [https://archive.org/details/firstdirectorate00kalu/page/180 180] |isbn = 978-0-312-11426-8 |url = https://archive.org/details/firstdirectorate00kalu/page/180 }}</ref><ref>{{cite techreport | last = Carus | first = Seth | year = 1998 | title= Bioterrorism and Biocrimes | url = https://fas.org/irp/threat/cbw/carus.pdf | publisher = Federation of American Scientists |page=84 | format = PDF}}</ref> The attempt left him seriously ill but he survived.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Toxic Politics: The Secret History of the Kremlin's Poison Laboratory—from the Special Cabinet to the Death of Litvinenko |last=Vaksberg |first=Arkadiĭ|date=2011|publisher=Praeger|isbn=978-0-313-38747-0|location=Santa Barbara, Calif|pages=130–131}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| edition = Rev. and updated| publisher = Ignatius Press| isbn = 978-1-58617-496-5| last = Pearce| first = Joseph| title = Solzhenitsyn: A Soul in Exile| location = San Francisco| date = 2011|page=57}}</ref>

Although ''The Gulag Archipelago'' was not published in the Soviet Union, it was extensively criticized by the Party-controlled Soviet press. An editorial in ''[[Pravda]]'' on 14 January 1974 accused Solzhenitsyn of supporting "Hitlerites" and making "excuses for the crimes of the [[Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia|Vlasovites]] and [[Stepan Bandera|Bandera]] gangs." According to the editorial, Solzhenitsyn was "choking with pathological hatred for the country where he was born and grew up, for the socialist system, and for Soviet people."<ref>{{Citation | title = Current Digest of the Soviet Press | volume = 26 | number = 2 | year = 1974 | page = 2}}</ref>

During this period, he was sheltered by the cellist [[Mstislav Rostropovich]], who suffered considerably for his support of Solzhenitsyn and was eventually forced into exile himself.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morrison|first=S.|date=1 February 2010|title=Rostropovich's Recollections|journal=Music and Letters|language=en|volume=91|issue=1|pages=83–90|doi=10.1093/ml/gcp066|s2cid=191621525|issn=0027-4224}}</ref>

=== Expulsion from the Soviet Union ===

In a discussion of its options in dealing with Solzhenitsyn the members of the Politburo considered his arrest and imprisonment and his expulsion to a capitalist country willing to take him.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://bukovskyarchive.wordpress.com/2016/07/05/7-january-1974-pb/ |title=The Bukovsky Archives, 7 January 1974. |access-date=6 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004224648/https://bukovskyarchive.wordpress.com/2016/07/05/7-january-1974-pb/ |archive-date=4 October 2016 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Guided by KGB chief [[Yury Andropov]], and following a statement from West German Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]] that Solzhenitsyn could live and work freely in [[West Germany]], it was decided to deport the writer directly to that country.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://bukovskyarchive.wordpress.com/2016/07/05/7-february-1974-350-a-ov/ |title=The Bukovsky Archives, 7 February 1974, 350 A/ov. |access-date=6 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161004224816/https://bukovskyarchive.wordpress.com/2016/07/05/7-february-1974-350-a-ov/ |archive-date=4 October 2016 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

=== In the West ===

[[File:De schrijver staat de pers te woord, rechts naast hem Heinrich Böll, Bestanddeelnr 927-0020.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Solzhenitsyn with [[Heinrich Böll]] in {{Interlanguage link|Langenbroich|de}}, West Germany, 1974]]

On 12 February 1974, Solzhenitsyn was arrested and deported the next day from the Soviet Union to [[Frankfurt]], West Germany and stripped of his Soviet citizenship.<ref name="NYT20080804" /> The KGB had found the manuscript for the first part of ''The Gulag Archipelago''. US military attaché [[William Odom]] managed to smuggle out a large portion of Solzhenitsyn's archive, including the author's membership card for the [[Writers' Union]] and his Second World War military citations. Solzhenitsyn paid tribute to Odom's role in his memoir ''Invisible Allies'' (1995).

In West Germany, Solzhenitsyn lived in [[Heinrich Böll]]'s house in {{Interlanguage link|Langenbroich|de}}. He then moved to [[Zürich]], Switzerland before [[Stanford University]] invited him to stay in the United States to "facilitate your work, and to accommodate you and your family". He stayed at the [[Hoover Tower]], part of the [[Hoover Institution]], before moving to [[Cavendish, Vermont|Cavendish]], Vermont, in 1976. He was given an honorary literary degree from [[Harvard University]] in 1978 and on 8 June 1978 he gave a commencement address, condemning, among other things, the press, the lack of spirituality and traditional values, and the [[anthropocentrism]] of Western culture.<ref name=harvard>{{Citation|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/document/document060603.asp |title=A World Split Apart |series=Harvard Class Day Exercises |date=8 June 1978 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030608093915/http://www.nationalreview.com/document/document060603.asp |archive-date=8 June 2003 }}</ref>

On 19 September 1974, [[Yuri Andropov]] approved a large-scale operation to discredit Solzhenitsyn and his family and cut his communications with [[Soviet dissidents]]. The plan was jointly approved by [[Vladimir Kryuchkov]], [[Philipp Bobkov]], and Grigorenko (heads of First, Second and Fifth KGB Directorates).<ref name="Andrew">{{Citation | author1-link = Christopher Andrew (historian)| last1 = Andrew | first1 = Christopher | author2-link = Vasili Mitrokhin| last2 = Mitrokhin | first2 = Vasili | year = 2000 | title = The Mitrokhin Archive: The KGB in Europe and the West | publisher = Gardners Books | isbn = 978-0-14-028487-4 | pages = 416–19}}</ref> The [[Ambassadorial residence|residencies]] in Geneva, London, Paris, Rome and other European cities participated in the operation. Among other active measures, at least three [[StB]] agents became translators and secretaries of Solzhenitsyn (one of them translated the poem ''[[Prussian Nights]]''), keeping the KGB informed regarding all contacts by Solzhenitsyn.<ref name="Andrew" />

The KGB also sponsored a series of hostile books about Solzhenitsyn, most notably a "memoir published under the name of his first wife, Natalia Reshetovskaya, but probably mostly composed by Service", according to historian [[Christopher Andrew (historian)|Christopher Andrew]].<ref name= Andrew /> Andropov also gave an order to create "an atmosphere of distrust and suspicion between Pauk{{Efn | KGB gave Solzhenitsyn the code name ''Pauk'', which means "spider" in Russian.}} and the people around him" by feeding him rumors that the people around him were KGB agents, and deceiving him at every opportunity.  Among other things, he continually received envelopes with photographs of car crashes, brain surgery and other disturbing imagery. After the KGB harassment in Zürich, Solzhenitsyn settled in [[Cavendish, Vermont|Cavendish]], Vermont, reduced communications with others.  His influence and [[moral authority]] for the West diminished as he became increasingly isolated and critical of Western individualism. KGB and [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] experts finally concluded that he alienated American listeners by his "reactionary views and intransigent criticism of the US way of life", so no further [[active measures]] would be required.<ref name = Andrew />

Over the next 17 years, Solzhenitsyn worked on his dramatized history of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], ''[[The Red Wheel]]''. By 1992, four sections had been completed and he had also written several shorter works.

Despite spending almost two decades in the United States, Solzhenitsyn did not become fluent in spoken English. He had, however, been reading English-language literature since his teens, encouraged by his mother.{{Citation needed | date= August 2008}} More importantly, he resented the idea of becoming a media star and of tempering his ideas or ways of talking in order to suit television. Solzhenitsyn's warnings about the dangers of Communist aggression and the weakening of the moral fiber of the West were generally well received in Western conservative circles (e.g. Ford administration staffers [[Dick Cheney]] and [[Donald Rumsfeld]] advocated on Solzhenitsyn's behalf for him to speak directly to President [[Gerald Ford]] about the Soviet threat),<ref>{{cite book| last1 =Mann | first1 = James | last2 = Mann | first2 = Jim | title= Rise of the Vulcans: The History of Bush's War Cabinet|url=https://archive.org/details/riseofvulcanshis00mann| url-access =registration |year=2004|publisher=Penguin |isbn = 978-0-14-303489-6 | pages= [https://archive.org/details/riseofvulcanshis00mann/page/64 64]–66}}</ref> prior to and alongside the tougher foreign policy pursued by US President [[Ronald Reagan]]. At the same time, liberals and [[secularism|secularists]] became increasingly critical of what they perceived as his [[reactionary]] preference for [[Russian nationalism]] and the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] religion.

Solzhenitsyn also harshly criticised what he saw as the ugliness and spiritual vapidity of the dominant [[popular culture|pop culture]] of the modern West, including television and much of popular music: "...the human soul longs for things higher, warmer, and purer than those offered by today's mass living habits... by TV stupor and by intolerable music." Despite his criticism of the "weakness" of the West, Solzhenitsyn always made clear that he admired the political liberty which was one of the enduring strengths of Western democratic societies. In a major speech delivered to the [[International Academy of Philosophy]] in [[Liechtenstein]] on 14 September 1993, Solzhenitsyn implored the West not to "lose sight of its own values, its historically unique stability of civic life under the rule of law—a hard-won stability which grants independence and space to every private citizen."<ref>[[#Ericson2009|Ericson (2009)]] p. 599</ref>

In a series of writings, speeches, and interviews after his return to his native Russia in 1994, Solzhenitsyn spoke about his admiration for the local self-government he had witnessed first hand in Switzerland and New England.<ref>"Russia in Collapse" in [[#Ericson2009|Ericson (2009)]] pp. 480–1</ref><ref>"The Cavendish Farewell" in [[#Ericson2009|Ericson (2009)]] pp. 606–07</ref> He "praised 'the sensible and sure process of [[grassroots democracy]], in which the local population solves most of its problems on its own, not waiting for the decisions of higher authorities.'"<ref>{{Citation | author-link = Bill Kauffman | last = Kauffman | first = William 'Bill' | date = 19 December 2005 | url = http://www.amconmag.com/article/2005/dec/19/00016/ | title = Free Vermont | newspaper = [[The American Conservative]] | access-date = 26 January 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101026132450/http://www.amconmag.com/article/2005/dec/19/00016/ | archive-date = 26 October 2010 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Solzhenitsyn's patriotism was inward-looking.

=== Return to Russia ===

[[File:A solzhenitsin.JPG|thumb|Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn looks out from a train, in [[Vladivostok]], summer 1994, before departing on a journey across Russia. Solzhenitsyn returned to Russia after nearly 20 years in exile.]]

In 1990, his Soviet citizenship was restored, and, in 1994, he returned to Russia with his wife, Natalia, who had become a United States citizen. Their sons stayed behind in the United States (later, his eldest son Yermolai returned to Russia). From then until his death, he lived with his wife in a [[dacha]] in [[Troitse-Lykovo]] in west Moscow between the dachas once occupied by Soviet leaders [[Mikhail Suslov]] and [[Konstantin Chernenko]]. A staunch believer in traditional Russian culture, Solzhenitsyn expressed his disillusionment with post-Soviet Russia in works such as ''Rebuilding Russia'', and called for the establishment of a strong presidential republic balanced by vigorous institutions of local self-government. The latter would remain his major political theme.<ref>{{Citation | last = Solzhenitsyn | first = Aleksandr Isaevich | title = Rebuilding Russia | place = New York | publisher = Farrar, Straus & Giroux | year = 1991}}</ref> Solzhenitsyn also published eight two-part short stories, a series of contemplative "miniatures" or prose poems, and a literary memoir on his years in the West ''The Grain Between the Millstones'', translated and released as two works by the [[University of Notre Dame]] as part of the [[Kennan Institute]]'s Solzhenitsyn Initiative.<ref>{{cite web |title=Large Works & Novels > Between Two Millstones |url=https://www.solzhenitsyncenter.org/his-writings/large-works-and-novels/between-two-millstones |website=SolzhenitsynCenter.org/ |publisher=The Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn Center |access-date=3 October 2020}}</ref> The first, ''Between Two Millstones, Book 1: Sketches of Exile (1974–1978)'', was translated by Peter Constantine and published in October 2018, the second, ''Book 2: Exile in America (1978–1994)'' translated by Clare Kitson and Melanie Moore and published in October 2020.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Solzhenitsyn |first1=Aleksandr |title=Solzhenitsyn's Journey from Oppression to Independence |work=The Wall Street Journal |issue=3 October 2020 |publisher=Dow Jones & Company}}</ref>

== Views on history and politics ==

=== On Christianity, Tsarism, and Russian nationalism ===
According to William Harrison, Solzhenitsyn was an "arch-[[reactionary]]," who argued that the Soviet State "suppressed" traditional Russian and [[Ukrainian culture]], called for the creation of a united Slavic state encompassing [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Belarus]], and who was a fierce opponent of [[Ukrainian nationalism|Ukrainian independence]]. Harrison also alleged that Solzhenitsyn held [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavist]] and [[Monarchism|monarchist]] views. According to Harrison, "His historical writing is imbued with a hankering after an idealized [[Tsarist]] era when, seemingly, everything was rosy. He sought refuge in a dreamy past, where, he believed, a united Slavic state (the Russian empire) built on Orthodox foundations had provided an ideological alternative to western individualistic liberalism."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Harrison|first=William|date=4 August 2008|title=William Harrison: Solzhenitsyn was an arch-reactionary|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/aug/04/solzhenitsyn.russia|access-date=8 July 2020|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

In his writings and speeches, Solzhenitsyn, however, has sharply criticized the policies of every [[Tsar]] from the [[House of Romanov]]. A persistent theme in his criticism has been that the Romanovs preferred, like [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] during the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1848]], to intervene in the internal affairs of foreign countries while governing badly at home.

Solzhenitsyn has also repeatedly denounced Tsar [[Alexis of Russia]] and [[Patriarch Nikon of Moscow]] for causing the [[Raskol|Great Schism of 1666]], which Solzhenitsyn says both divided and weakened the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] at a time when unity was desperately needed. Solzhenitsyn also attacked both the Tsar and the Patriarch for using [[excommunication]], [[Siberia]]n [[internal exile|Exile]], imprisonment torture, and even [[burning at the stake]] against the [[Old Believers]], who rejected the liturgical changes which caused the Schism.

Solzhenitsyn has also argued that the Dechristianization of [[Russian culture]], which he considers most responsible for the [[Bolshevik Revolution]], began in 1666, became much worse during the Reign of Tsar [[Peter the Great]], and accelerated into an epidemic during [[The Enlightenment]], the [[Romantic era]], and the [[Silver Age of Russian Poetry|Silver Age]].

Expanding upon this theme, Solzhenitsyn once declared, "Over a half century ago, while I was still a child, I recall hearing a number of old people offer the following explanation for the great disasters that had befallen Russia: 'Men have forgotten God; that's why all this has happened. Since then I have spent well-nigh 50 years working on the history of our revolution; in the process I have read hundreds of books, collected hundreds of personal testimonies, and have already contributed eight volumes of my own toward the effort of clearing away the rubble left by that upheaval. But if I were asked today to formulate as concisely as possible the main cause of the ruinous revolution that swallowed up some 60 million of our people, I could not put it more accurately than to repeat: 'Men have forgotten God; that's why all this has happened.'"<ref>Ericson, Edward E. Jr. (October 1985) "Solzhenitsyn – Voice from the Gulag,"</ref>

In an interview with [[Joseph Pearce]], however, Solzhenitsyn commented, "[The [[Old Believers]] were] treated amazingly unjustly, because some very insignificant, trifling differences in ritual which were promoted with poor judgment and without much sound basis. Because of these small differences, they were persecuted in very many cruel ways, they were suppressed, they were exiled. From the perspective of historical justice, I sympathise with them and I am on their side, but this in no way ties in with what I have just said about the fact that religion in order to keep up with mankind must adapt its forms toward modern culture. In other words, do I agree with the [[Old Believers]] that religion should freeze and not move at all? Not at all!"<ref>Joseph Pearce (2011), ''Solzhenitsyn: A Soul in Exile'', [[Ignatius Press]]. Page 329–330.</ref>

When asked by Pearce for his opinions about the division within the [[Roman Catholic Church]] over the [[Second Vatican Council]] and the [[Mass of Paul VI]], Solzhenitsyn replied, "A question peculiar to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] is, should we continue to use [[Old Church Slavonic]], or should we start to introduce more of the contemporary Russian language into the service? I understand the fears of both those in the Orthodox and in the Catholic Church, the wariness, the hesitation, and the fear that this is lowering the Church to the modern condition, the modern surroundings. I understand this, but alas, I fear that if religion does not allow itself to change, it will be impossible to return the world to religion because the world is incapable on its own of rising as high as the old demands of religion. Religion needs to come and meet it somewhat."<ref>Joseph Pearce (2011), ''Solzhenitsyn: A Soul in Exile'', [[Ignatius Press]]. Page 330.</ref>

Surprised to hear Solzhenitsyn, "so often perceived as an arch-traditionalist, apparently coming down on the side of the reformers", Pearce then asked Solzhenitsyn what he thought of the division caused within the [[Anglican Communion]] by the [[Ordination of women in the Anglican Communion|decision to ordain female priests]].<ref>Joseph Pearce (2011), ''Solzhenitsyn: A Soul in Exile'', [[Ignatius Press]]. Pages 330-331.</ref>

Solzhenitsyn replied, "Certainly there are many firm boundaries that should not be changed. When I speak of some sort of correlation between the cultural norms of the present, it is really only a small part of the whole thing." Solzhenitsyn then added, "Certainly, I do not believe that women priests is the way to go!"<ref name="Joseph Pearce 2011 Page 331">Joseph Pearce (2011), ''Solzhenitsyn: A Soul in Exile'', [[Ignatius Press]].

=== On Russia and the Jews ===

[[File:Frenkel2.jpg|thumb|[[Naftaly Frenkel]] (far right) and head of Gulag [[Matvei Berman]] (center) at the [[White Sea–Baltic Canal]] works, July 1932]]

[[OGPU]] officer [[Naftaly Frenkel]], whom Solzhenitsyn identified as "a Turkish Jew born in Constantinople", is represented as having played a major role in the organisation of work in the Gulag. Solzhenitsyn claimed that Frenkel was the "nerve of the Archipelago".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Journal of Historical Review, Volume 21|publisher=Institute for Historical Review, 2002|page=31|title-link=Journal of Historical Review}}</ref>

In his 1974 essay "Repentance and Self-Limitation in the Life of Nations", Solzhenitsyn urged "Russian Gentiles" and Jews alike to take moral responsibility for the "renegades" from both communities who enthusiastically embraced [[atheism]] and [[Marxism–Leninism]] and participated in the [[Red Terror]] and many other acts of torture and mass murder following the [[October Revolution]]. Solzhenitsyn argued that both Russian Gentiles and Jews should be prepared to treat the atrocities committed by Jewish and Gentile [[Bolsheviks]] as though they were the acts of their own family members, before their consciences and before God. Solzhenitsyn said that if we deny all responsibility for the crimes of our national kin, "the very concept of a people loses all meaning."<ref>[[#Ericson2009|Ericson (2009)]] pp. 527–55</ref>

In a review of Solzhenitsyn's novel ''August 1914'' in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 13 November 1985, [[Jewish American]] historian [[Richard Pipes]] wrote: "Every culture has its own brand of anti-Semitism. In Solzhenitsyn's case, it's not racial. It has nothing to do with blood. He's certainly not a racist; the question is fundamentally religious and cultural. He bears some resemblance to [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], who was a fervent Christian and patriot and a rabid anti-Semite. Solzhenitsyn is unquestionably in the grip of the Russian extreme right's view of the Revolution, which is that it was [[Jewish Bolshevism|the doing of the Jews]]".<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]] p. 490</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Grenier |first=Richard |date=13 November 1985 |title=Solzhenitsyn and anti-Semitism: a new debate |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/13/books/solzhenitsyn-and-anti-semitism-a-new-debate.html |work=The New York Times |location=New York |access-date=6 October 2019 }}</ref> Award-winning Jewish novelist and [[the Holocaust]] survivor [[Elie Wiesel]] disagreed and wrote that Solzhenitsyn was "too intelligent, too honest, too courageous, too great a writer" to be an anti-Semite.<ref>[[#Thomas|Thomas]] p. 491</ref> In his 1998 book ''Russia in Collapse'', Solzhenitsyn criticized the Russian far-right's obsession with anti-Semitic and anti-Masonic [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]].<ref>[[#Ericson2009|Ericson (2009)]] p. 496.</ref>

[[File:Brodnica sołżenicyn.jpg|thumb|A monument dedicated to Solzhenitsyn in [[Brodnica]] in Poland]]
Solzhenitsyn emphasized the significantly more oppressive character of the Soviet [[police state]], in comparison to the [[Russian Empire]] of the [[House of Romanov]]. He asserted that Imperial Russia did not censor literature or the media to the extreme style of the Soviet [[Glavlit]],<ref>[http://www.beaconforfreedom.org/about_database/russia.html "A brief history of censorship in Russia in 19th and 20th century"] ''Beacon for Freedom'' {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216181044/http://www.beaconforfreedom.org/about_database/russia.html |date=16 February 2011 }}</ref> that political prisoners typically were not forced into [[labor camps]],<ref>{{Citation | last = Gentes | first = Andrew | year = 2005 | chapter-url = http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/eserv/UQ:8015/katorga.pdf | chapter = Katorga: Penal Labor and Tsarist Siberia | title = The Siberian Saga: A History of Russia's Wild East | editor-first = Eva-Maria | editor-last = Stolberg | place = Frankfurt am Main | publisher = Peter Lang }}</ref> and that the number of political prisoners and exiles was only one ten-thousandth of the numbers of prisoners and Exiles following the [[Bolshevik Revolution]].

Shortly before his return to Russia, Solzhenitsyn delivered a speech in [[Les Lucs-sur-Boulogne]] to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the [[Vendée Uprising]]. During his speech, Solzhenitsyn compared Lenin's [[Bolshevik]]s with the [[Jacobin Club]] during the [[French Revolution]]. He also compared the Vendean rebels with the Russian, Ukrainian, and Cossack peasants who rebelled against the Bolsheviks, saying that both were destroyed mercilessly by revolutionary despotism. He commented that, while the French [[Reign of Terror]] ended with the [[Thermidorian reaction]] and the toppling of the Jacobins and the execution of [[Maximilien Robespierre]], its Soviet equivalent continued to accelerate until the [[Khrushchev thaw]] of the 1950s.<ref>''The Solzhenitsyn Reader: New and Essential Writings 1947–2005'', (2008), [[ISI Books]]. pp. 602–05.</ref> According to Solzhenitsyn, Russians were not the ruling nation in the Soviet Union. He believed that all the traditional culture of all ethnic groups were equally oppressed in favor of atheism and Marxist–Leninism. Russian culture was even more repressed than any other culture in the Soviet Union, since the regime was more afraid of ethnic uprisings among Russian Christians than among any other ethnicity. Therefore, Solzhenitsyn argued, [[Russian nationalism]] and the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] should not be regarded as a threat by the West but rather as allies.<ref>{{cite journal | title= Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Russian Nationalism |first= David G | last= Rowley | journal = Journal of Contemporary History |volume=32 |issue=3 |year=1997 |pages=321–37 |jstor= 260964 | doi=10.1177/002200949703200303|s2cid= 161761611 }}</ref>

Solzhenitsyn made a speaking tour after [[Francisco Franco]]'s death, and "told liberals not to push too hard for changes because Spain had more freedoms now than the Soviet Union had ever known." As reported by ''[[The New York Times]]'', he "blamed Communism for the death of 110 million Russians and derided those in Spain who complained of dictatorship."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1976/03/22/archives/solzhenitsyn-bids-spain-use-caution.html|title=Solzhenitsyn Bids Spain Use Caution|work=The New York Times|date=22 March 1976|access-date=13 August 2021|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Solzhenitsyn recalled: "I had to explain to the people of Spain in the most concise possible terms what it meant to have been subjugated by an ideology as we in the Soviet Union had been, and give the Spanish to understand what a terrible fate they escaped in 1939", a reference to the [[Spanish Civil War]] between the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]] and the [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republicans]], which was not a common view at that time among American diplomats. For [[Winston Lord]], a protégé of the then United States Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]], Solzhenitsyn was "just about a fascist."<ref>{{cite news|last=Caldwell|first=Chrsitopher|date=10 January 2019|url=https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/01/28/aleksandr-solzhenitsyn-book-review/|title=Solzhenitsyn in Exile|work=National Review|access-date=13 August 2021}}</ref> According to Elisa Kriza, Solzhenitsyn held "benevevolent views" on Franco's dictatorship and [[Francoist Spain]] because it was a Christian one, and his Christian worldview operated ideologically.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kriza|first=Elisa|year=2014|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t1H_BgAAQBAJ|title=Alexander Solzhenitsyn: Cold War Icon, Gulag Author, Russian Nationalist?: A Study of His Western Reception|publisher=Columbia University Press|page=235|isbn=978-3-8382-6689-3}}</ref> In ''The Little Grain Managed to Land Between Two Millstones'', Franco's Spain is "held up as a model of a proper Christian response to the evil of Bolshevism." According to Peter Brooke, Solzhenitsyn approached the position argued by Christian Dmitri Panin, with whom he had a fell out in exile, namely that evil "must be confronted by force, and the centralised, spiritually independent Roman Catholic Church is better placed to do it than Orthodoxy with its otherworldliness and tradition of subservience to the state."<ref>{{cite magazine|last=MacNeice|first=Louis|date=Summer 2010|url=https://drb.ie/articles/what-came-up-was-goosegrass/|title=What Came Up Was Goosegrass|magazine=Dublin Review of Books|access-date=13 August 2021}}</ref>

In "Rebuilding Russia", an essay first published in 1990 in ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'', Solzhenitsyn urged the Soviet Union to grant independence to all the non-Slav [[Republics of the Soviet Union|republics]], which he claimed were sapping the Russian nation and he called for the creation of a new Slavic state bringing together Russia, [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], and parts of [[Kazakhstan]] that he considered to be [[Russified]].<ref name= RFLSolUKma>{{Citation | url = http://www.rferl.org/content/Solzhenitsyn_Leaves_Troubled_Legacy_Across_Former_Soviet_Union/1188876.html | title = Solzhenitsyn Leaves Troubled Legacy Across Former Soviet Union | newspaper = [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] | date = 6 August 2008}}</ref>

=== On post-Soviet Russia ===

[[File:Vladimir Putin with Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn-1.jpg|thumb|Solzhenitsyn with [[Vladimir Putin]] in 2007]]

In some of his later political writings, such as ''Rebuilding Russia'' (1990) and ''Russia in Collapse'' (1998), Solzhenitsyn criticized the [[Russian oligarchs|oligarchic excesses]] of the new Russian democracy, while opposing any nostalgia for Soviet Communism. He defended moderate and self-critical patriotism (as opposed to [[Extremist nationalism in Russia|extreme nationalism]]). He also urged for local self-government similar to what he had seen in [[New England]] [[town meeting]]s and in the Cantons of [[Switzerland]]. He also expressed concern for the fate of the 25 million ethnic Russians in the "[[near abroad]]" of the former Soviet Union.

In an interview with [[Joseph Pearce]], Solzhenitsyn was asked whether he felt that the [[Distributism|socioeconomic theories]] of [[E.F. Schumacher]] were, "the key to society rediscovering its sanity". He replied, "I do believe that it would be the key, but I don't think this will happen, because people succumb to fashion, and they suffer from inertia and it is hard to them to come round to a different point of view."<ref name="Joseph Pearce 2011 Page 331"/>

Solzhenitsyn refused to accept Russia's highest honor, the [[Order of St. Andrew]], in 1998. Solzhenitsyn later said: "In 1998, it was the country's low point, with people in misery; ... [[Boris Yeltsin|Yeltsin]] decreed I be honored the highest state order. I replied that I was unable to receive an award from a government that had led Russia into such dire straits."<ref name="Solzhenitsyn 2007"/> In a 2003 interview with [[Joseph Pearce]], Solzhenitsyn said: "We are exiting from communism in a most unfortunate and awkward way. It would have been difficult to design a path out of communism worse than the one that has been followed."<ref>Interview published in [http://www.catholiceducation.org/en/culture/art/an-interview-with-alexander-solzhenitsyn.html ''St. Austin Review'' 2 no. 2 (February 2003)]</ref>

In a 2007 interview with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', Solzhenitsyn expressed disappointment that the "conflation of 'Soviet' and 'Russian'", against which he spoke so often in the 1970s, had not passed away in the West, in the [[Eastern Bloc|ex-socialist countries]], or in the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet republics]]. He commented, "The elder political generation in communist countries is not ready for repentance, while the new generation is only too happy to voice grievances and level accusations, with present-day Moscow [as] a convenient target. They behave as if they heroically liberated themselves and lead a new life now, while Moscow has remained communist. Nevertheless, I dare [to] hope that this unhealthy phase will soon be over, that all the peoples who have lived through communism will understand that communism is to blame for the bitter pages of their history."<ref name="Solzhenitsyn 2007">{{Citation | url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/spiegel-interview-with-alexander-solzhenitsyn-i-am-not-afraid-of-death-a-496211.html | type = interview | first = Aleksandr I | last = Solzhenitsyn | title = I Am Not Afraid of Death | newspaper = [[Der Spiegel]] | issue = 30 | year = 2007}}</ref>

On 20 September 2000, Solzhenitsyn met newly elected Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theimaginativeconservative.org/2018/08/vladimir-putin-alexander-solzhenitsyn-joseph-pearce.html|title=Putin and Solzhenitsyn|first=Joseph|last=Pearce|date=21 August 2018}}</ref> In 2008, Solzhenitsyn praised Putin, saying Russia was rediscovering what it meant to be Russian. Solzhenitsyn also praised the Russian president [[Dmitry Medvedev]] as a "nice young man" who was capable of taking on the challenges Russia was facing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/02/wikileaks-cables-solzhenitsyn-vladimir-putin|title=WikiLeaks cables: Solzhenitsyn praise for Vladimir Putin|first=Luke|last=Harding|date=2 December 2010|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>

=== Criticism of the West ===

Once in the United States, Solzhenitsyn sharply criticized the West.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1978/06/09/solzhenitsyn-says-west-is-failing-as-model-for-world/69e9fb6c-60d6-41f3-9022-606631a60e35/?noredirect=on Solzhenitsyn Says West Is Failing as Model for World], by By Lee Lescaze 9 June 1978, ''[[The Washington Post]]''</ref>

Solzhenitsyn criticized the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] for not opening a new front against [[Nazi Germany]] in the west earlier in World War II. This resulted in Soviet domination and control of the nations of Eastern Europe. Solzhenitsyn claimed the Western democracies apparently cared little about how many died in the East, as long as they could end the war quickly and painlessly for themselves in the West.

Delivering the commencement address at [[Harvard University]] in 1978, he called the United States "Dechristianized" and mired in boorish [[Economic materialism|consumerism]]. The [[American people]], he said, speaking in Russian through a translator, were also suffering from a "decline in courage" and a "lack of manliness." Few were willing to die for their ideals, he said. He also condemned the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s Counterculture]] for forcing the [[United States Federal Government]] to accept a "hasty" capitulation in the [[Vietnam War]].

In a reference to the Communist governments in Southeast Asia's use of [[Re-education camp (Vietnam)|re-education camps]], [[politicide]], [[human rights abuses]], and [[Cambodian genocide|genocide]] following the [[Fall of Saigon]], Solzhenitsyn said: "But members of the [[Peace movement#United States|U.S. antiwar movement]] wound up being involved in the betrayal of Far Eastern nations, in a [[genocide]] and in the suffering today imposed on 30 million people there. Do those convinced pacifists hear the moans coming from there?"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/13/archives/the-editorial-notebook-the-decline-of-the-west.html|title=The Editorial Notebook The Decline of the West|newspaper=The New York Times|date=13 June 1978}}</ref>

He also accused the Western news media of Left-Wing bias, of violating the privacy of celebrities, and of filling up the "immortal souls" of their readers with celebrity gossip and other "vain talk". He also said that the West erred in thinking that the whole world should embrace this as model. While faulting Soviet society for rejecting basic [[human rights]] and the [[rule of law]], he also critiqued the West for being too [[legalism (Western philosophy)|legalistic]]: "A society which is based on the letter of the law and never reaches any higher is taking very scarce advantage of the high level of human possibilities." Solzhenitsyn also argued that the West erred in "denying [Russian culture's] autonomous character and therefore never understood it".<ref name=harvard />

Solzhenitsyn criticized the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] and accused the United States of the "occupation" of [[Kosovo]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Solzhenitsyn: a life of dissent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/solzhenitsyn-a-life-of-dissent-884590.html |work=The Independent |date=4 August 2008}}</ref>

Solzhenitsyn was critical of [[Enlargement of NATO|NATO's eastward expansion]] towards Russia's borders.<ref name="bbc"/> In 2006, Solzhenitsyn accused [[NATO]] of trying to bring Russia under its control; he claimed this was visible because of its "ideological support for the '[[colour revolutions]]' and the paradoxical forcing of North Atlantic interests on Central Asia".<ref name="bbc">{{Citation | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4953690.stm | title = Solzhenitsyn warns of Nato plot | newspaper = [[BBC News]] | date = 28 April 2006}}</ref> In a 2006 interview with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' he stated "This was especially painful in the case of Ukraine, a country whose closeness to Russia is defined by literally millions of family ties among our peoples, relatives living on different sides of the national border.  At one fell stroke, these families could be torn apart by a new dividing line, the border of a military bloc."<ref name="Solzhenitsyn 2007" />

=== On the Holodomor ===
Solzhenitsyn gave a speech to [[AFL–CIO]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], on 30 June 1975 in which he mentioned how the system created by the [[Bolsheviks]] in 1917 caused dozens of problems in the Soviet Union.<ref name="Seventy five">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/SolzhenitsynTheVoiceOfFreedom|title=Solzhenitsyn: The Voice of Freedom |author=Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn|work=AFL–CIO|date=30 June 1975|access-date=22 June 2016}}</ref> He described how this system was responsible for the [[Holodomor]]: "It was a system which, in time of peace, artificially created a famine, causing 6 million people to die in the Ukraine in 1932 and 1933." Solzhenitsyn added, "they died on the very edge of Europe. And Europe didn't even notice it. The world didn't even notice it—6 million people!"<ref name="Seventy five"/>

Shortly before his death, Solzhenitsyn opined in an interview published 2 April 2008 in ''[[Izvestia]]'' that, while the famine in Ukraine was both artificial and caused by the state, it was no different than the [[Russian famine of 1921]]. Solzhenitsyn expressed the belief that both famines were caused by systematic [[armed robbery]] of the harvests from both Russian and Ukrainian peasants by Bolshevik units, which were under orders from the [[Politburo]] to bring back food for the starving urban population centers while refusing for ideological reasons to permit any private sale of food supplies in the cities or to give any payment to the peasants in return for the food that was seized.<ref name="Solzh"/> Solzhenitsyn further alleged that the theory that the [[Holodomor]] was a [[genocide]] which only victimized the [[Ukrainian people]] was created decades later by believers in an [[Russophobia|anti-Russian]] form of [[extreme nationalism|extreme]] [[Ukrainian nationalism]]. Solzhenitsyn also cautioned that the ultranationalists' claims risked being accepted without question in the West due to widespread ignorance and misunderstanding there of both [[Russian history|Russian]] and [[Ukrainian history]].<ref name="Solzh">{{cite news|first=Alexander|last=Solzhenitsyn|author-link=Alexander Solzhenitsyn|url=http://www.izvestia.ru/opinions/article3114723/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405034053/http://www.izvestia.ru/opinions/article3114723|archive-date=5 April 2008|script-title=ru:Поссорить родные народы??|work=[[Izvestia]]|language=ru|date=2 April 2008|access-date=27 November 2011}}</ref>

Solzhenitsyn is the subject of the song "[[Mother Russia (Renaissance song)|Mother Russia]]" by British progressive rock group [[Renaissance (band)|Renaissance]].

Solzhenitsyn's philosophy plays a key role in the 2012 film ''[[Cloud Atlas (film)|Cloud Atlas]]'', where a character previously kept ignorant and subservient is illegally educated, and is shown reading and quoting his works.<ref name="illegally educated">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/synchronized-banality-cloud-atlas |title=Synchronized Banality: Cloud Atlas' |first=Richard |last=Brody |date=1 November 2012|magazine=[[The New Yorker]]}}</ref>

====Television documentaries on Solzhenitsyn====
In October 1983, French literary journalist [[Bernard Pivot]] made an hour-long television interview with Solzhenitsyn at his rural home in Vermont, US.
