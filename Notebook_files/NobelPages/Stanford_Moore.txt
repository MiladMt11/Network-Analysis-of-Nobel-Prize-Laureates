'''Stanford Moore''' (September 4, 1913 &ndash; August 23, 1982) was an American [[biochemist]]. He shared a [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1972, with [[Christian B. Anfinsen]] and [[William Howard Stein]], for work done at [[Rockefeller University]] on the structure of the enzyme [[ribonuclease]] and for contributing to the understanding of the connection between the [[chemical structure]] and [[catalysis|catalytic activity]] of the ribonuclease molecule.

Moore attended [[Peabody Demonstration School]], now known as University School of Nashville, and in 1935 graduated [[summa cum laude]]  from [[Vanderbilt University]], where he was a member of [[Phi Kappa Sigma]].  He earned his doctorate in Organic Chemistry from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1938.  Moore then joined the staff of the Rockefeller Institute, later Rockefeller University, where he spent his entire professional career, with the exception of a period of government service during World War II.  He became Professor of Biochemistry in 1952.

In 1958, he and [[William H. Stein]] developed the first automated amino acid analyzer, which facilitated the determination of [[protein sequence]]s. In 1959, Moore and Stein announced the first determination of the complete amino acid sequence of an enzyme, ribonuclease, work which was cited in the Nobel award. He never married.
