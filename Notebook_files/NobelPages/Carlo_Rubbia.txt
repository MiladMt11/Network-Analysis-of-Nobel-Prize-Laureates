==Early life and education==
Rubbia was born in 1934 in [[Gorizia]], an Italian town on the border with [[Slovenia]]. His family moved to [[Venice]] then [[Udine]] because of wartime disruption. His father was an electrical engineer and encouraged him to study the same, though he stated his wish to study physics. In the local countryside, he collected and experimented with abandoned military communications equipment. After taking an entrance exam for the [[Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa]] to study physics, he failed to get into the required top ten (coming eleventh), so began an engineering course in [[University of Milan|Milan]] in 1953. Soon after, a Pisa student dropped out, presenting Rubbia with his opportunity. He gained a degree and doctorate in a relatively short time with a thesis on cosmic ray experimentation; his adviser was [[Marcello Conversi]]. At Pisa, he met his future wife, Marisa, also a Physics student.<ref name="Discover Cern">{{cite magazine |magazine=Discover|title=Scientist of the Year: Carlo Rubbia: the Lord of the Atom-Smashers|year=1984|author=Gary Taubes|pages=39|url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/714268/files/presscut-1984-029.pdf |access-date=1 June 2021}}</ref><ref name="Physics World">{{cite web|url=https://physicsworld.com/a/what-carlo-did-next/|title=Personalities: Personalities/Careers: What Carlo Did Next|website=physicsworld.com|date=1 May 1997|author=Susan Biggin|access-date=1 June 2021}}</ref>

==Career and research==
Following his degree, he went to the United States to do [[postdoctoral research]],<ref name = CVCR /> where he spent about one and a half years at [[Columbia University]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://physics.columbia.edu/about-us/columbia-nobels |title=Columbia Nobels |access-date=1 September 2015 |publisher=Columbia University |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150624022235/http://physics.columbia.edu/about-us/columbia-nobels |archive-date=24 June 2015}}</ref> performing experiments on the decay and the nuclear capture of [[muon]]s. This was the first of a long series of experiments that Rubbia has performed in the field of [[weak interaction]]s and which culminated in the Nobel Prize-winning work at CERN.

He moved back to Europe for a placement at the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] before joining the newly founded [[CERN]] in 1960, where he worked on experiments on the structure of weak interactions. CERN had just commissioned a new type of accelerator, the [[Intersecting Storage Rings]], using counter-rotating beams of [[proton]]s colliding against each other.  Rubbia and his collaborators conducted experiments there, again studying the weak force. The main results in this field were the observation of the structure in the elastic scattering process and the first observation of the [[charm quark|charmed]] baryons. These experiments were crucial in order to perfect the techniques needed later for the discovery of more exotic particles in a different type of particle collider.<ref name="Discover Cern"/><ref name="Cern Courier"/><ref name="New York Times"/>

In 1976, he suggested adapting CERN's [[Super Proton Synchrotron]] (SPS) to collide protons and antiprotons in the same ring – the [[Proton-Antiproton Collider]]. Using [[Simon van der Meer]]s technology of [[stochastic cooling]], the [[Antiproton Accumulator]] was also built. The collider started running in 1981 and, in early 1983, an international team of more than 100 physicists headed by Rubbia and known as the UA1 Collaboration, detected the intermediate vector bosons, the [[W and Z bosons]], which had become a cornerstone of modern theories of [[elementary particle physics]] long before this direct observation. They carry the weak force that causes [[radioactive decay]] in the [[atomic nucleus]] and controls the combustion of the [[Sun]], just as [[photons]], massless particles of light, carry the [[electromagnetic force]] which causes most physical and biochemical reactions. The weak force also plays a fundamental role in the [[nucleosynthesis]] of the elements, as studied in theories of stars evolution.  These particles have a mass almost 100 times greater than the proton. In 1984 Carlo Rubbia and Simon van der Meer were awarded the Nobel Prize "for their decisive contributions to the large project, which led to the discovery of the field particles W and Z, communicators of weak interaction"

To achieve energies high enough to create these particles, Rubbia, together with David Cline and Peter McIntyre, proposed a radically new particle accelerator design. They proposed to use a beam of [[protons]] and a beam of [[antiproton]]s, their [[antimatter]] twins, counter rotating in the vacuum pipe of the accelerator and colliding head-on. The idea of creating particles by colliding beams of more "ordinary" particles was not new: electron-positron and proton-proton colliders were already in use. However, by the late 1970s / early 1980s those could not approach the needed energies in the centre of mass to explore the W/Z region predicted by theory. At those energies, protons colliding with anti-protons were the best candidates, but how to obtain sufficiently intense (and well-collimated) beams of anti-protons, which are normally produced impinging a beam of protons on a fixed target? Van den Meer had in the meantime developed the concept of "stochastic cooling", in which particles, like anti-protons could be kept in a circular array, and their beam divergence reduced progressively by sending signals to bending magnets downstream. Since decreasing the divergence of the beam meant to reduce transverse velocity or energy components, the suggestive term "stochastic cooling" was given to the scheme. The scheme could then be used to "cool" (to collimate) the anti-protons, which could thus be forced into a well-focused beam, suitable for acceleration to high energies, without losing too many anti-protons to collisions with the structure. Stochastic expresses the fact that signals to be taken resemble random noise, which was called "Schottky noise" when first encountered in vacuum tubes. Without van der Meer's technique, UA1 would never have had the sufficient high-intensity anti-protons it needed. Without Rubbia's realisation of its usefulness, stochastic cooling would have been the subject of a few publications and nothing else. Simon van de Meer developed and tested the technology in the proton Intersecting Storage Rings at CERN, but it is most effective on rather low intensity beams, such as the anti-protons which were prepared for use in the SPS when configured as a collider.

In addition to the observation of the intermediate vector mesons, the CERN [[Proton-Antiproton Collider]] dominated the scene of high energy physics from its first operation in 1981 until its close in 1991, when the [[Tevatron]] at [[Fermilab]] took over this role. An entirely new phenomenology of high energy collisions has resulted, in which strong interaction phenomena are dominated by the exchange of the quanta of the strong force, the [[gluon]]s, particles which are similar to the intermediate vector bosons, although, like the photons, they are apparently massless. Instead, the W and Z particles are among the heaviest particles so far produced in a particle accelerator.

Together, these discoveries provide strong evidence that theoretical physicists are on the right track in their efforts to describe Nature at its most basic level through the so-called "[[Standard Model]]". The data on the intermediate vector bosons confirm the predictions included in the "electroweak" theory, which gained the 1979 Nobel Prize for Physics to [[Steven Weinberg]], [[Sheldon Glashow]] and [[Abdus Salam]]. The "electroweak" theory attempts to unite two of the four forces of nature—the weak and the electromagnetic forces—under the same set of equations. It provides the basis for work on the long-standing dream of the theoretical physicists, a [[unified field theory]], encompassing also the strong force which binds together the atomic nucleus, and ultimately, [[gravity]].

In 1970 Rubbia was appointed Higgins Professor of Physics at [[Harvard University]], where he spent one semester per year for 18 years,<ref name = CVCR /> while continuing his research activities at CERN. In 1989, he was appointed Director-General of the CERN Laboratory.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/1731464/ |title=Looking to the future |access-date=1 September 2015 |website=CERN Courier |publisher=CERN}}</ref> During his mandate, in 1993, "CERN agreed to allow anybody to use the Web protocol and code free of charge … without any royalty or other constraint"<ref>Berners-Lee, T., Fischetti, M., & Foreword By-Dertouzos, M. L. (2000). Weaving the Web: The original design and ultimate destiny of the World Wide Web by its inventor. HarperInformation.</ref>

Rubbia has also been one of the leaders in a collaboration effort deep in the [[Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso|Gran Sasso Laboratory]], designed to detect any sign of decay of the proton. The experiment seeks evidence that would disprove the conventional belief that matter is stable. The most widely accepted version of the unified field theories predicts that protons do not last forever, but gradually decay into energy after an average lifetime of at least 10<sup>32</sup> years. The same experiment, known as [[ICARUS (experiment)|ICARUS]] and based on a new technique of electronic detection of ionizing events in ultra-pure liquid [[argon]], is aiming at the direct detection of the neutrinos emitted from the Sun, a first rudimentary neutrino telescope to explore neutrino signals of cosmic nature.

Rubbia further proposed the concept of an [[energy amplifier]], a novel and safe way of producing nuclear energy exploiting present-day accelerator technologies, which is actively being studied worldwide in order to incinerate high activity waste from nuclear reactors, and produce energy from natural [[thorium]] and depleted [[uranium]]. In 2013 he proposed building a large number of small-scale thorium power plants<ref>{{cite web |last=Boyle |first=Rebecca |url=http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-08/thorium-reactors-could-wean-world-oil-just-five-years |title=Development of Tiny Thorium Reactors Could Wean the World Off Oil in Just Five Years &#124; Popular Science |publisher=Popsci.com |date=2010-08-30 |access-date=2013-09-06}}</ref>

Rubbia's research activities are concentrated on the problem of energy supply for the future, with particular focus on the development of new technologies for renewable energy sources. During his term as President of [[ENEA (Italy)|ENEA]] (1999–2005) he has promoted a novel method for [[Concentrated solar power|concentrating solar power]] at high temperatures for energy production, known as the [[Archimede combined cycle power plant|Archimede Project]], which is being developed by industry for commercial use.

Carlo Rubbia was principal Scientific Adviser of [[CIEMAT]] (Spain), a member of the high-level Advisory Group on [[Climate change|global warming]] set up by EU's President Barroso in 2007 and of the board of trustees at the [[IMDEA]] Energy Institute. In 2009–2010 he was Special Adviser for Energy to the Secretary General of ECLAC, the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, based in Santiago (Chile). In June 2010 Carlo Rubbia has been appointed Scientific Director of the Institute for Advanced Sustainability Studies in Potsdam (Germany). He is a member of the [[Italy-USA Foundation]].

Marisa and Carlo Rubbia have two children.<ref name="Discover Cern"/>
