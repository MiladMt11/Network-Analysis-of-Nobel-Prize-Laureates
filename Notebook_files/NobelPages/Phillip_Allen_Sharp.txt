'''Phillip Allen Sharp''' (born June 6, 1944) is an  [[United States of America|American]] [[geneticist]] and [[molecular biology|molecular biologist]] who co-discovered [[RNA splicing]]. He shared the 1993 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] with [[Richard J. Roberts]] for "the discovery that [[gene]]s in [[eukaryote]]s are not contiguous strings but contain [[intron]]s, and that the splicing of [[messenger RNA]] to delete those [[introns]] can occur in different ways, yielding different [[protein]]s from the same DNA sequence".<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1993/|title = The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1993|access-date = November 12, 2014|website = Nobelprize.org|publisher = Nobel Media}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal

==Research==
Sharp's current research focuses on small RNAs and other types of [[non-coding RNAs]]. His laboratory works to identify the target [[mRNAs]] of [[microRNAs]] (miRNAs), and has discovered a class of miRNAs that are produced from sequences adjacent to [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] start sites. His laboratory also studies how miRNA [[Regulation of gene expression|gene regulation]] functions in [[angiogenesis]] and cellular stress.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/medicine/laureates/1993/sharp-autobio.html Autobiography] at the Nobel site</ref><ref>[http://web.mit.edu/biology/www/facultyareas/facresearch/sharp.html Sharp's Research at MIT] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206035817/http://web.mit.edu/biology/www/facultyareas/facresearch/sharp.html |date=December 6, 2006 }}</ref><ref name=OralHistoryCHF>{{cite book|first1= Arnold |last1=Thackray|first2= David C. |last2=Brock|first3= Mona|last3= Ashiya |title=Phillip A.
