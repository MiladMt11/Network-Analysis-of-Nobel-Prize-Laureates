'''Richard Royce Schrock''' (born January 4, 1945) is an American chemist and [[Nobel laureate]] recognized for his contributions to the [[olefin metathesis]] reaction used in [[organic chemistry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2005/|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2005|publisher=Nobelprize.org}}</ref><ref name="Mansuy2005">{{cite journal|last1=Mansuy|first1=Daniel|title=Métathèse et catalyse à l'honneur|journal=Médecine/Sciences|volume=21|issue=11|year=2005|pages=995–997|issn=0767-0974|doi=10.1051/medsci/20052111995|pmid=16274653|doi-access=free}}</ref>

==Education==
Born in [[Berne, Indiana]], Schrock went to [[Mission Bay High School]] in [[San Diego, California]]. He holds a B.A. (1967) from the [[University of California, Riverside]] and a Ph. D. (1971) from [[Harvard University]]<ref name="thesis-schrock-1972">{{cite thesis |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/302685249/ |title=Synthesis and study of some Group VIII transition metal catalysts |date=1972 |publisher=[[Harvard University]] |type=Ph.D. |last=Schrock |first=Richard Royce |via=[[ProQuest]] |url-access=subscription |oclc=76998410}}</ref>  under the direction of [[John A.

==Career==
Following his PhD, Schrock carried out [[postdoctoral research]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] with [[Jack Lewis, Baron Lewis of Newnham|Jack Lewis]]. In 1972, he was hired by [[DuPont]], where he worked at the [[DuPont Experimental Station|Experimental Station]] in [[Wilmington, Delaware]] in the group of [[George Parshall]]. He joined the faculty of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1975 and became full [[professor]] in 1980.<ref name=autobiog>{{Nobelprize|accessdate=October 11, 2020}}</ref>

He has held his current post, the Frederick G. Keyes Professor of Chemistry, at MIT since 1989. Schrock is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and was elected to the Board of Overseers of Harvard University in 2007.

He is co-founder and member of the board of a Swiss-based company focused on the development and application of proprietary metathesis catalyst.<ref name=XimoWebsite>[http://www.ximo-inc.com Website von Ximo AG]. Ximo-inc.com. Retrieved on January 4, 2013.</ref>

In 2018, Schrock joined the faculty of his alma mater, the [[University of California, Riverside]]. He cited his interest in mentoring junior faculty and students. “My experience as an undergraduate at UCR in research in the laboratory of James Pitts and the quality of the classes in chemistry prepared me for my Ph.D. experience at Harvard.  I look forward to returning to UCR for a few years to give back some of what it gave to me,” Schrock said.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ucrtoday.ucr.edu/54406|title=Nobel Prize Winner to Join UC Riverside Faculty|work=UCR Today|access-date=August 7, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>

Schrock currently sits on the board of directors for [[Xyleco]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Board of Directory |publisher=Xyleco |url=https://www.xyleco.com/board/ |access-date=January 9, 2019}}</ref>

==Awards and honors==

===Nobel Prize===
In 2005, Schrock received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]], with [[Robert H. Grubbs]] and [[Yves Chauvin]], for his work in the area of [[olefin metathesis]], an [[organic synthesis]] technique. Schrock was the first to elucidate the structure and mechanism of so-called 'black box' olefin metathesis catalysts. Initial work at DuPont involved the synthesis of tantalum alkylidenes, alkylidenes being a crucial resting state in the catalytic cycle of olefin metathesis. His work at MIT has led to a detailed understanding of a group of molybdenum alkylidenes and alkylidynes which are active olefin and alkyne metathesis catalysts, respectively. Schrock has done much work to demonstrate that metallacyclobutanes are the key intermediate in [[olefin metathesis]], with metallacyclobutadienes being the key intermediate in alkyne metathesis.

Many supporting ligands have been explored in efforts to better understand the nature of the single molecule catalysts, most notably 2,6-diisopropylphenylimido and adamantylimido, as well as various tert-butyl alkoxides with varying degrees of fluorination. The prototypical Schrock catalyst is {{chem2|(R"O)2(R'N)Mo(CHR)}} where R = tert-butyl, R' = 2,6-diisopropylphenyl, and R" = {{chem2|C(Me)(CF3)2}}. Such catalysts are now commercially available from such major suppliers as Sigma-Aldrich, and are used frequently in synthetic applications of olefin metathesis. Schrock's work is ongoing with goals of furthering the understanding of metathesis selectivity, developing new catalyst architectures, as well as projects outside of metathesis, such as elucidating the mechanism of [[nitrogen fixation|dinitrogen fixation]] and developing single molecule catalysts which form ammonia from dinitrogen, mimicking the activity of [[nitrogenase]] enzymes in biology.<ref>Schrock, R.
