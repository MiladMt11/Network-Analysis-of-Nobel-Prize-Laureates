'''Frederik Willem de Klerk''' {{post-nominals|country=ZAR|OMG|DMS}} ({{IPAc-en|d|ə|_|ˈ|k|l|ɜːr|k|,_|d|ə|_|ˈ|k|l|ɛər|k}}, {{IPA-af|ˈfriədərək ˈvələm də ˈklɛrk|lang}}, 18 March 1936 – 11 November 2021) was a South African politician and Nobel Peace Prize laureate who served as [[state president of South Africa]] from 1989 to 1994 and as [[Deputy President of South Africa|deputy president]] from 1994 to 1996. As South Africa's last head of state from the era of white-minority rule, he and his government dismantled the [[apartheid]] system and introduced [[universal suffrage]]. Ideologically a conservative and an [[Economic liberalism|economic liberal]], he led the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] (NP) from 1989 to 1997.

Born in [[Johannesburg]] to an influential [[Afrikaners|Afrikaner]] family, de Klerk studied at [[Potchefstroom University]] before pursuing a career in law. Joining the NP, to which he had family ties, he was elected to parliament and sat in the [[Dominant minority|white-minority government]] of [[P. W. Botha]], holding a succession of ministerial posts. As a minister, he supported and enforced apartheid, a system of [[racial segregation]] that privileged [[white South Africans]]. After Botha resigned in 1989, de Klerk replaced him, first as leader of the NP and then as State President. Although observers expected him to continue Botha's defence of apartheid, de Klerk decided to end the policy. He was aware that growing ethnic animosity and violence was leading South Africa into a racial civil war. Amid this violence, the state security forces committed widespread human rights abuses and encouraged violence between the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] and [[Zulu people]], although de Klerk later denied sanctioning such actions. He permitted [[Internal resistance to apartheid|anti-apartheid]] marches to take place, legalised a range of previously banned anti-apartheid political parties, and freed imprisoned anti-apartheid activists such as [[Nelson Mandela]]. He also dismantled [[South Africa's nuclear weapons program]].

De Klerk negotiated with Mandela to fully dismantle apartheid and establish a transition to universal suffrage. In 1993, he publicly apologized for apartheid's harmful effects. He oversaw the [[1994 South African general election|1994 non-racial election]] in which Mandela led the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) to victory; de Klerk's NP took second place. De Klerk then became Deputy President in Mandela's ANC-led [[coalition government|coalition]], the [[Cabinet of Nelson Mandela|Government of National Unity]]. In this position, he supported the government continued liberal economic policies but opposed the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] set up to investigate past [[Human rights in South Africa|human rights]] abuses because he wanted total amnesty for political crimes. His working relationship with Mandela was strained, although he later spoke fondly of him. In May 1996, after the NP objected to the [[Constitution of South Africa|new constitution]], de Klerk withdrew it from the coalition government; the party disbanded the following year and reformed as the [[New National Party (South Africa)|New National Party]]. In 1997, he retired from active politics and thereafter lectured internationally.

De Klerk was a controversial figure among many sections of South African society, all for different reasons. He received many awards, including the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for dismantling apartheid and bringing universal suffrage to South Africa. Conversely, he received criticism from anti-apartheid activists for offering only a qualified apology for apartheid, and for ignoring the human rights abuses by state security forces. He was also condemned by South Africa's white nationalists, who contended that by abandoning apartheid, he betrayed the interests of the country's white minority.

==Early life and education==

===Childhood: 1936–1954===
F. W. de Klerk was born on 18 March 1936 in [[Mayfair, Gauteng|Mayfair]], a suburb of [[Johannesburg]].{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=149}} His parents were [[Johannes de Klerk|Johannes "Jan" de Klerk]] and Hendrina Cornelia Coetzer – "her forefather was a Kutzer who stems from [[Austria]]."<ref>A. Kamsteeg, E. Van Dijk, F. W. de Klerk, man of the moment. 1990</ref> He was his parents' second son, having a brother, Willem de Klerk, who was eight years his senior.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=149}} De Klerk's first language was Afrikaans and the earliest of his distant ancestors to arrive in what is now South Africa did so in the late 1680s.<ref name="cspan">{{Cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?124979-1/the-trek-beginning|date=11 June 1999|work=Washington Journal|publisher=C-SPAN|quote=Yes, I'm an African, born and bred. My forebears arrived in South Africa in 1688. My later forebears fought the first modern anti-colonial war on the continent of Africa, against Great Britain. I'm an African, through and through, and the fact that I'm white does not detract from my total commitment to my country and through my country, to our continent.|access-date=7 September 2018|title=The Last Trek: A New Beginning|archive-date=7 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180907110445/https://www.c-span.org/video/?124979-1%2Fthe-trek-beginning|url-status=live}}</ref>

De Klerk had a secure and comfortable upbringing, and his family had played a leading role in Afrikaner society;{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=81}} they had longstanding affiliations with South Africa's [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]].{{sfn|Glad|Blanton|1997|pp=566–567}} His paternal great-grandfather, [[Jan van Rooy]], had been a [[Senate of South Africa|Senator]], while his paternal grandfather, Willem, had been a clergyman who fought in the [[Second Boer War]]<ref name="cspan" /> and stood twice, unsuccessfully, as a National Party candidate.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=139}} His paternal aunt's husband was [[Johannes Gerhardus Strijdom|J. G. Strijdom]], a former Prime Minister.{{sfnm|1a1=de Klerk|1y=1991|1p=140|2a1=Glad|2a2=Blanton|2y=1997|2p=579}} His own father, [[Jan de Klerk]], was also a senator, served as the secretary of the National Party in Transvaal, [[Senate of South Africa#Presidents of the Senate of South Africa (1910–1980 and 1994–1997)|president of the senate]] for seven years, acting state president, and as a member of the country's cabinet for fifteen years under three prime ministers.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|pp=139, 140}} In this environment, de Klerk was exposed to politics from childhood.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=140}} He and family members would be encouraged to hold family debates; his more conservative opinions would be challenged by his brother Willem, who was sympathetic to the more [[liberalism|liberal]], "enlightened" faction of the National Party.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=149}} Willem became a political analyst and later split from the National Party to found the liberal [[Democratic Party (South Africa)|Democratic Party]].{{sfn|Glad|Blanton|1997|p=579}}

The name "de Klerk" is derived from Le Clerc, Le Clercq and De Clercq, and is of French [[Huguenots in South Africa|Huguenot origin]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Lugan|first=Bernard|year=1996|title=Ces Français qui ont fait l'Afrique du Sud (''The French People Who Made South Africa'')|publisher=Bartillat|isbn=978-2-84100-086-9}}</ref> (meaning "clergyman" or "literate" in old French). De Klerk noted that he was also of Dutch descent,<ref>{{cite web |author=Sapa-dpa |url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/sport/soccer/article542568.ece/Diplomatic-FW-to-cheer-for-Dutch |title='Diplomatic' FW to cheer for Dutch |work=Sunday Times (Johannesburg) |date=9 July 2010 |access-date=11 December 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192802/http://www.timeslive.co.za/sport/soccer/article542568.ece/Diplomatic-FW-to-cheer-for-Dutch |archive-date=29 October 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trouw.nl/krantenarchief/1995/11/13/2572116/Frederik_en_Marike_de_Klerk_vinden_hun_wortels_in_Zeeland.html |title=Frederik en Marike de Klerk vinden hun wortels in Zeeland |work=Trouw |date=13 November 1995 |access-date=13 February 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919212006/http://www.trouw.nl/krantenarchief/1995/11/13/2572116/Frederik_en_Marike_de_Klerk_vinden_hun_wortels_in_Zeeland.html |archive-date=19 September 2011}}</ref> with an [[Indian South Africans#Dutch servitude in the Cape|Indian]] ancestor from the late-1690s or early 1700s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/199902080126.html|title=South Africa: FW de Klerk Reveals Colourful Ancestry|first=Michael|last=Morris|date=8 February 1999|via=AllAfrica|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171128190330/http://allafrica.com/stories/199902080126.html|archive-date=28 November 2017}}</ref> He was also said to have been descended from the [[Khoikhoi|Khoi]] interpreter known as [[Krotoa]] or Eva.<ref>{{cite web |author=Sharon Marshall |url=http://www.southafrica.info/about/history/mixedmarriages-genealogy.htm |title=What's in a (South African) name? – |publisher=Southafrica.info |access-date=11 December 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193319/http://www.southafrica.info/about/history/mixedmarriages-genealogy.htm |archive-date=29 October 2013 }}</ref>

When de Klerk was twelve years old, the [[apartheid]] system was officially institutionalised by the South African government;{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=61}} his father had been one of its originators.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=142}} He therefore was, according to his brother, "one of a generation that grew up with the concept of apartheid".{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=61}} He was inculturated in the norms and values of Afrikaner society, including festivals like [[Kruger Day]], loyalty to the Afrikaner nation, and stories of the "age of injustice" that the Afrikaner faced under the British.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=81}} He was brought up in the [[Gereformeerde Kerk]], the smallest and most [[social conservatism|socially conservative]] of South Africa's [[Dutch Reformed Church in South Africa|three Dutch Reformed Churches]].{{sfnm|1a1=de Klerk|1y=1991|1p=147|2a1=Glad|2a2=Blanton|2y=1997|2p=579}}

The de Klerk family moved around South Africa during his childhood, and he changed schools seven times over seven years.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=149}} He eventually became a boarder at the Monument High School in [[Krugersdorp]], where he graduated with a first-class pass in 1953.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=149}} He was nevertheless disappointed not to get the four distinctions he was hoping for.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=149}}

===University and legal career===
Between 1954 and 1958, de Klerk studied at [[Potchefstroom University]], graduating with both a [[Bachelor of Arts]] and a [[Bachelor of Law]].{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=150}}{{sfn|Glad|Blanton|1997|p=579}} He later noted that during this legal training, he "became accustomed to thinking in terms of legal principles".{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=26}} While studying there, he became editor of the student newspaper, vice-chair of the student council, and a member of the Afrikaanse Studentebond's(a large South African youth movement) national executive council.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=150}} At university, he was initiated into the [[Broederbond]], a secret society for the Afrikaner social elite.{{sfn|Glad|Blanton|1997|p=567}} As a student, he played both tennis and hockey and was known as "something of a ladies' man".{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=150}} At the university, he began a relationship with [[Marike de Klerk|Marike Willemse]], the daughter of a professor at the [[University of Pretoria]].{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|pp=144, 150}} The couple married in 1959, when de Klerk was 23 and his wife 22.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=144}}

After university, de Klerk pursued a legal career, becoming an [[articled clerk]] with the firm Pelser in Klerksdorp.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=150}} Relocating to Pretoria, he became an articled clerk for another law firm, Mac-Robert.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=151}}
In 1962, he set up his own law partnership in [[Vereeniging]], Transvaal, which he built into a successful business over ten years.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=151}}
During this period, he involved himself in a range of other activities. He was the national chair of the Junior Rapportryers for two years, and chair of the Law Society of Vaal Triangle.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=151}} He was also on the council of the local technikon, on the council of his church, and on a local school board.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=151}}

===Early political career===
In 1972, his alma mater offered him a chair in its law faculty, which he accepted.{{sfnm|1a1=de Klerk|1y=1991|1p=151|2a1=Glad|2a2=Blanton|2y=1997|2p=579}} Within a matter of days he was also approached by members of the National Party, who requested that he stand for the party at [[Vereeniging]]. De Klerk's candidature was successful and in November he was elected to the [[House of Assembly of South Africa|House of Assembly]].{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=151}} There, he established a reputation as a formidable debater.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=151}} He took on a number of roles in the party and government. He became the information officer of the Transvaal National Party, responsible for its propaganda output,{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=152}} and helped to establish a new National Party youth movement.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=152}} He joined various party parliamentary study groups, including those on the [[Bantustans]], labour, justice, and home affairs.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=152}} As a member of various parliamentary groups, de Klerk went on several foreign visits, to Israel, Germany, the United Kingdom, and United States.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=152}} It was in the latter in 1976 that he observed what he later described as the pervasive racism of US society, later noting that he "saw more racial incidents in one month there than in South Africa in a year".{{sfn|Glad|Blanton|1997|p=580}} In South Africa, de Klerk also played a senior role in two select committees, one formulating a policy on opening hotels to non-Whites and the other formulating a new censorship law that was less strict than the one that had preceded it.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=152}}

In 1975, Prime Minister [[John Vorster]] predicted that de Klerk would one day become leader of South Africa.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=153}} Vorster planned to promote de Klerk to the position of a deputy minister in January 1976, but instead the job went to [[Andries Treurnicht]].{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=153}} In April 1978, de Klerk was promoted to the position of Minister of Social Welfare and Pensions.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=153}} In this role, he restored full autonomy to sporting control bodies which had for a time been under the jurisdiction of the government.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=153}} As minister of Post and Telecommunications, he finalized contracts that oversaw the electrification of that sector.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=153}} As Minister of Mining, he formalized a policy on coal exports and the structuring of [[Eskom]] and the [[Atomic Energy Corporation]].{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=153}} He then became Minister of the Interior, he oversaw the repeal of the Mixed Marriages Act.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=153}}
In 1981, de Klerk was awarded the Decoration for Meritorious Service for his work in the government.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=154}} As education minister between 1984 and 1989, he upheld the apartheid system in South Africa's schools,{{sfn|Glad|Blanton|1997|p=567}} and extended the department to cover all racial groups.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=153}}

For most of his career, de Klerk had a very conservative reputation,{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=17}} and was seen as someone who would obstruct change in South Africa.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=20}} He had been a forceful proponent of apartheid's system of racial segregation and was perceived as an advocate of the white minority's interests.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|pp=18–19}} While serving under [[P. W. Botha]]'s government, de Klerk was never part of Botha's inner circle.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=154}}

==State presidency==
P. W. Botha resigned as leader of the National Party after an apparent stroke, and de Klerk defeated Botha's preferred successor, finance minister [[Barend du Plessis]], in the race to succeed him. On 2 February 1989, he was elected leader of the National Party.{{sfnm|1a1=de Klerk|1y=1991|1p=15|2a1=Glad|2a2=Blanton|2y=1997|2p=567}} He defeated main rival Barend du Plessis to the position by a majority of eight votes, 69–61.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=18}} Soon after, he called for the introduction of a new South African constitution, hinting that it would need to provide greater concession to non-white racial groups.{{sfn|Glad|Blanton|1997|p=567}} After becoming party leader, de Klerk extended his foreign contacts.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=299–300}} He travelled to London, where he met with British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Although she opposed the anti-apartheid movement's calls for economic sanctions against South Africa, at the meeting she urged de Klerk to release the imprisoned anti-apartheid activist [[Nelson Mandela]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=300}} He also expressed a desire to meet with representatives of the US government in Washington D.C., although American secretary of state [[James Baker]] informed him that the US government considered it inopportune to have de Klerk meet with President [[George H. W. Bush]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=300}}

===Becoming state president===
[[File:F.W. de Klerk wait to speak in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania LCCN2011634246 (cropped).tif|thumb|upright|De Klerk in [[Philadelphia]], 1992]]
Botha resigned on 14 August 1989, and de Klerk was named acting state president until 20 September, when he was elected to a full five-year term as state president.{{sfn|Glad|Blanton|1997|p=567}} After he became acting president, ANC leaders spoke out against him, believing that he would be no different from his predecessors;{{sfn|Glad|Blanton|1997|p=567}} he was widely regarded as a staunch supporter of apartheid.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=16}} The prominent anti-apartheid activist [[Desmond Tutu]] shared this assessment, stating: "I don't think we've got to even begin to pretend that there is any reason for thinking that we are entering a new phase. It's just musical chairs".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=310}} Tutu and [[Allan Boesak]] had been planning a protest march in [[Cape Town]], which the security chiefs wanted to prevent. De Klerk nevertheless turned down their proposal to ban it, agreeing to let the march proceed and stating that "the door to a new South Africa is open, it is not necessary to batter it down".{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=309–310}} The march took place and was attended by approximately 30,000 people.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=311}} Further protest marches followed in [[Grahamstown]], Johannesburg, Pretoria, and [[Durban]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=311–312}} De Klerk later noted that his security forces could not have prevented the marchers from gathering: "The choice, therefore, was between breaking up an illegal march with all of the attendant risks of violence and negative publicity, or of allowing the march to continue, subject to conditions that could help to avoid violence and ensure good public order."{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=312}} This decision marked a clear departure from the Botha era.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=312}}

As President, he authorised the continuation of secret talks in [[Geneva]] between his [[National Intelligence Service (South Africa)|National Intelligence Service]] and two exiled ANC leaders, [[Thabo Mbeki]] and [[Jacob Zuma]].{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=312}} In October, he personally agreed to meet with Tutu, Boesak, and [[Frank Chikane]] in a private meeting in Pretoria.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=312–313}} That month, he also released a number of elderly anti-apartheid activists then imprisoned, including [[Walter Sisulu]].{{sfnm|1a1=Glad|1a2=Blanton|1y=1997|1p=567|2a1=Allen|2y=2006|2p=312}} He also ordered the closure of the [[National Security Management System]].{{sfn|Glad|Blanton|1997|p=567}} In December he visited Mandela in prison, speaking with him for three hours about the idea of transitioning away from white-minority rule.{{sfn|Glad|Blanton|1997|p=567}} The collapse of the [[Eastern Bloc]] and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolution]] of the [[Soviet Union]] meant that he no longer feared that [[Marxism|Marxists]] would manipulate the ANC.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=27}} As he later related, the collapse of "the Marxist economic system in Eastern Europe... serves as a warning to those who insist on persisting with it in Africa. Those who seek to force this failure of a system on South Africa should engage in a total revision of their point of view. It should be clear to all that it is not the answer here either."{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=35}}

De Klerk later related that "that speech was mainly aimed at breaking our stalemate in Africa and the West.

His presidency was dominated by the [[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|negotiation process]], mainly between his NP government and the ANC, which led to the democratization of South Africa. On 17 March 1992, de Klerk held a whites-only [[1992 South African apartheid referendum|referendum on ending apartheid]], with the result being an overwhelming "yes" vote to continue negotiations to end apartheid.<ref name="telegraph" />

On 17 July 1992, the [[Boipatong massacre]] by the Inkatha Freedom Party occurred, killing 45 people.

On 30 April 1993, de Klerk issued an apology for the actions of the apartheid government, stating that: "It was not our intention to deprive people of their rights and to cause misery, but eventually apartheid led to just that. Insofar as to what occurred we deeply regret it... Yes we are sorry".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=343}} Tutu urged people to accept the apology, stating that "saying sorry is not an easy thing to do... We should be magnanimous and accept it as a magnanimous act", although Tutu was privately frustrated that de Klerk's apology had been qualified and had not gone so far as to call apartheid an intrinsically evil policy.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=343}}

De Klerk authorized the [[1993 raid on Mthatha|raid on Mthatha]] against suspected [[Azanian People's Liberation Army]] (APLA) fighters on 8 October 1993 that killed three teenagers and two twelve year olds.

On 10 December 1993, de Klerk and Mandela were jointly awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in Oslo for their work in ending apartheid.<ref>{{cite web|title=Frederik Willem de Klerk Fast Facts| publisher=CNN| url=https://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/03/world/africa/frederik-willem-de-klerk-fast-facts/index.html| date=2 March 2021| access-date=12 September 2021|archive-date=12 September 2021| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210912194553/https://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/03/world/africa/frederik-willem-de-klerk-fast-facts/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

South Africa held its first [[1994 South African general election|universal elections in 1994]] from 26 to 29 April. The ANC won the election with 62 percent, while the National Party received 20 percent. De Klerk became deputy president in the [[national unity government]] under Nelson Mandela.

==Deputy presidency==
De Klerk had been unhappy that changes had been made to the inauguration ceremony, rendering it multi-religious rather than reflecting the newly elected leader's particular denomination.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=338}} When he was being sworn in, and the chief justice said "So help me God", de Klerk did not repeat this, instead stating, in Afrikaans: "So help me the triune God, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=339}}

Mandela reappointed de Klerk's finance minister, [[Derek Keys]], and retained [[Chris Stals]], a former member of the Broederbond, as the head of the Central Bank.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|pp=514, 515}} De Klerk supported the coalition's economic policies, stating that it "accepted a broad framework of responsible economic policies".{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=514}}

De Klerk's working relationship with Mandela was often strained, with the former finding it difficult adjusting to the fact that he was no longer president.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=534}} De Klerk also felt that Mandela deliberately humiliated him, while Mandela found de Klerk to be needlessly provocative in cabinet.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=534}} One dispute occurred in September 1995, after Mandela gave a Johannesburg speech criticizing the National Party. Angered, de Klerk avoided Mandela until the latter requested they meet. The two ran into each other, and they publicly argued in the streets. Mandela later expressed regret for their disagreement but did not apologize for his original comments.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=534}} De Klerk was also having problems from within his own party, some of whose members claimed that he was neglecting the party while in the government.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=534}}

Many in the National Party—including many members of its executive committee—were unhappy with the other parties' agreed upon new constitution in May 1996.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=534}} The party had wanted the constitution to guarantee that it would be represented in the government until 2004, although it did not do so. On 9 May, de Klerk withdrew the National Party from the coalition government.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=534}} The decision shocked several of his six fellow Afrikaner cabinet colleagues; [[Pik Botha]], for example, was left without a job as a result.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|pp=534–535}} [[Roelf Meyer]] felt betrayed by de Klerk's act, while [[Leon Wessels]] thought that de Klerk had not tried hard enough to make the coalition work.{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=535}} De Klerk declared that he would lead the National Party in vigorous opposition to Mandela's government to ensure "a proper multi-party democracy, without which there may be a danger of South Africa lapsing into the African pattern of [[one-party state]]s".{{sfn|Sampson|2011|p=535}}

===Truth and Reconciliation Commission===
[[File:Archbishop-Tutu-medium.jpg|thumb|upright|The chair of the TRC, [[Desmond Tutu]], was frustrated that de Klerk did not take responsibility for the actions of the state security services in the early 1990s.]]

In de Klerk's view, his greatest defeat in the negotiations with Mandela had been his inability to secure a blanket amnesty for all those working for the government or state during the apartheid period.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=362}} De Klerk was unhappy with the formation of the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]] (TRC).{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=362}} He had hoped that the TRC would be made up of an equal number of individuals from both the old and new governments, as there had been in the [[Rettig Report|Chilean human rights commission]]. Instead, the TRC was designed to broadly reflect the wider diversity of South African society, and contained only two members who had explicitly supported apartheid, one a member of a right-wing group that had opposed de Klerk's National Party.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=362–363}} De Klerk did not object to Tutu being selected as the TRC's chair for he regarded him as politically independent of Mandela's government, but he was upset that the white [[Progressive Party (South Africa)|Progressive Party]] MP [[Alex Boraine]] had been selected as its deputy chair, later saying of Boraine: "beneath an urbane and deceptively affable exterior beat the heart of a zealot and an inquisitor."{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=363}}

De Klerk appeared before the TRC hearing to testify for [[Vlakplaas]] commanders who were accused of having committed human rights abuses during the apartheid era. He acknowledged that security forces had resorted to "unconventional strategies" in dealing with anti-apartheid revolutionaries, but that "within my knowledge and experience, they never included the authorization of assassination, murder, torture, rape, assault or the like".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=363}} After further evidence of said abuses was produced by the commission, de Klerk stated that he found the revelations to be "as shocking and as abhorrent as anybody else" but insisted that he and other senior party members were not willing to accept responsibility for the "criminal actions of a handful of operatives", stating that their behavior was "not authorized [and] not intended" by his government.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=363}} Given the widespread and systemic nature of the abuses that had taken place, as well as statements by security officers that their actions had been sanctioned by higher ranking figures, Tutu questioned how de Klerk and other government figures could not have been aware of them.{{sfn|Allen|2006|pp=363–364}} Tutu had hoped that de Klerk or another senior white political figure from the apartheid era would openly accept responsibility for the human rights abuses, thereby allowing South Africa to move on; this was something that de Klerk would not do.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=364}}

The TRC found de Klerk guilty of being an accessory to gross violations of human rights on the basis that as State President he had been told that P. W. Botha had authorized the bombing of Khotso House but had not revealed this information to the Committee.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=364}} De Klerk challenged the TRC on this point, and it backed down.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=364}} When the final TRC report was released in 2002, it made a more limited accusation: that de Klerk had failed to give full disclosure about events that took place during his presidency and that in view of his knowledge about the Khotso House bombing, his statement that none of his colleagues had authorized gross human rights abuses was "indefensible".{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=364}} In his later autobiography, de Klerk acknowledged that the TRC did significant damage to his public image.{{sfn|Allen|2006|p=365}}

==Later life==
In 1997, de Klerk was offered the Harper Fellowship at [[Yale Law School]]. He declined, citing protests at the university.<ref>Gold, Emily. (28 March 1997).

In 2000, de Klerk established the pro-peace [[FW de Klerk Foundation]] of which he was the chairman. De Klerk was also chairman of the [[Global Leadership Foundation]], headquartered in London, which he set up in 2004, an organisation which works to support democratic leadership, prevent and resolve conflict through mediation and promote good governance in the form of democratic institutions, open markets, human rights and the rule of law. It does so by making available, discreetly and in confidence, the experience of former leaders to today's national leaders. It is a not-for-profit organisation composed of former heads of government and senior governmental and international organisation officials who work closely with heads of government on governance-related issues of concern to them.

On 3 December 2001, Marike de Klerk was found stabbed and strangled to death in her [[Cape Town]] flat. De Klerk, who was on a brief visit to [[Stockholm]], Sweden, to celebrate the 100-year anniversary of the Nobel Prize foundation, immediately returned to mourn his dead ex-wife. The atrocity was reportedly condemned strongly by South African president [[Thabo Mbeki]] and [[Winnie Mandela]], among others, who openly spoke in favour of Marike de Klerk.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/1364524/De-Klerks-ex-wife-is-found-knifed-and-strangled.html|title=De Klerk's ex-wife is found knifed and strangled|last=Butcher|first=Tim|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=6 December 2001|access-date=16 January 2020|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235|archive-date=24 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200424082053/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/southafrica/1364524/De-Klerks-ex-wife-is-found-knifed-and-strangled.html|url-status=live}}</ref> On 6 December 21-year-old security guard Luyanda Mboniswa was arrested for the murder.

In 2005, de Klerk quit the [[New National Party (South Africa)|New National Party]] and sought a new political home after the NNP merged with the ruling ANC. That same year, while giving an interview to US journalist [[Richard Stengel]], de Klerk was asked whether South Africa had turned out the way he envisioned it back in 1990. His response was:

<blockquote>There are a number of imperfections in the new South Africa where I would have hoped that things would be better, but on balance I think we have basically achieved what we set out to achieve. And if I were to draw balance sheets on where South Africa stands now, I would say that the positive outweighs the negative by far. There is a tendency by commentators across the world to focus on the few negatives which are quite negative, like how are we handling AIDS, like our role vis-à-vis Zimbabwe. But the positives – the stability in South Africa, the adherence to well-balanced economic policies, fighting inflation, doing all the right things in order to lay the basis and the foundation for sustained economic growth – are in place.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cfr.org/southern-africa/hbo-history-makers-series-frederik-willem-de-klerk/p7114?breadcrumb=%2Fregion%2F151%2Fsouthern_africa|title=HBO History Makers Series: Frederik Willem de Klerk|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622073025/http://www.cfr.org/southern-africa/hbo-history-makers-series-frederik-willem-de-klerk/p7114?breadcrumb=%2Fregion%2F151%2Fsouthern_africa|archive-date=22 June 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Political positions==
[[File:FW de Klerk Bust.jpeg|thumb|upright|Bust of de Klerk at the [[Voortrekker Monument]], Pretoria]]
De Klerk was widely regarded as a politically conservative figure in South Africa.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=17}} At the same time, he was flexible rather than dogmatic in his approach to political issues.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=17}} 
He often hedged his bets and sought to accommodate divergent perspectives,{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=18}} favouring compromise over confrontation.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=21}}
Within the National Party, he continually strove for unity, coming to be regarded—according to his brother—as "a party man, a veritable Mr National Party".{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=17}} To stem defections from the right-wing end of the National Party, he made "ultra-conservative noises".{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=18}} This general approach led to the perception that he was "trying to be all things to all men".{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=21}}

De Klerk stated that within the party, he "never formed part of a political school of thought, and I deliberately kept out of the cliques and foments of the enlightened and conservative factions in the party. If the policy I propounded was ultra-conservative, then that was the policy; it was not necessarily I who was ultra-conservative. I saw my role in the party as that of an interpreter of the party's real median policy at any stage."{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=24}}
De Klerk stated that "The silver thread throughout my career was my advocacy of National Party policy in all its various formulations. I refrained from adjusting that policy or adapting it to my own liking or convictions. I analyzed it as it was formulated, to the letter."{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=24}}

For much of his career, de Klerk believed in apartheid and its system of racial segregation.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|pp=18–19}}
According to his brother, de Klerk underwent a "political conversion" that took him from supporting apartheid to facilitating its demolition. This change was not "a dramatic event" however, but "was built... on pragmatism – it evolved as a process."{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=22}}
He did not believe that South Africa would become a "non-racial society", but rather sought to build a "non-racist society" in which ethnic divisions remained; in his view "I do not believe in the existence of anything like a non-racial society in the literal sense of the word", citing the example of the United States and United Kingdom where there was no legal racial segregation but that distinct racial groups continued to exist.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=64}}

De Klerk accepted the principle of [[freedom of religion]], although still believed that the state should promote Christianity.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=148}}

De Klerk wrote in opposition to gender-based violence, arguing that "holding perpetrators accountable, irrespective of how long ago the crime was committed, is essential to stamping out impunity and preventing future atrocities".<ref>{{Cite news|last=De Klerk|first=F. W.|date=10 March 2021|title=To protect women from violence today, we must secure justice for victims in the past|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/mar/10/protect-girls-women-violence-sexual-assault-justice-past-victims|url-status=live|access-date=22 March 2021|archive-date=22 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210322022805/https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2021/mar/10/protect-girls-women-violence-sexual-assault-justice-past-victims}}</ref>

==Personality and personal life==
Glad and Blanton stated that de Klerk's "political choices were undergirded by self-confidence and commitment to the common good."{{sfn|Glad|Blanton|1997|p=583}} His brother Willem stated that de Klerk's demeanour was marked by "soberness, humility and calm",{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=1}} that he was an honest, intelligent, and open minded individual,{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=23}} and that he had a "natural cordiality" and a "solid sense of courtesy and good manners".{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=74}} He felt that de Klerk's "charisma" came not from an "exceptionally strong individualism" but from "his rationality, logic and balance".{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=138}} He was, according to de Klerk, "a man of compromise rather than a political innovator or entrepreneur".{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|pp=128–129}}

Willem stated that "he keeps an ear to the ground and is sensitive to the slightest tremors", and that it was this which made him "a superb politician".{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|pp=22–23}} Willem also stated that his brother was "a team-man who consults others, takes them into his confidence, honestly shares information with his colleagues, and has a knack of making people feel importance and at peace".{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=74}}
His former wife Marike described de Klerk as being "extremely sensitive to beautiful things", exhibiting something akin to an artistic temperament.{{sfn|Glad|Blanton|1997|p=579}}

Willem also noted that "in the most profound sense", de Klerk was driven by his concern for Afrikanerdom and "the survival of his own people in their fatherland".{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=81}} De Klerk was deeply upset that many Afrikaners did not realise that his reforms to dismantle apartheid were carried out with the intention of preserving a future for the Afrikaner people in South Africa.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|pp=81–82}}

With Marike, de Klerk had three children: Susan, who became a teacher, Jan, who became a farmer in Western Transvaal, and Willem, who went into [[public relations]].{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=143}} Willem stated that de Klerk had a close relationship with his children,{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=144}} and that he was "a loving man who hugs and cuddles".{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=141}}

== Reception and legacy ==
Glad and Blanton stated that de Klerk, along with Mandela, "accomplished the rare feat of bringing about systemic revolution through peaceful means."{{sfn|Glad|Blanton|1997|p=565}} His brother noted that de Klerk's role in South African history was "to dismantle more than three centuries of white supremacy", and that in doing so his was "not a role of white surrender, but a role of white conversion to a new role" in society.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=57}}
In September 1990, Potchefstroom University awarded de Klerk an honorary doctorate.{{sfn|de Klerk|1991|p=154}}
