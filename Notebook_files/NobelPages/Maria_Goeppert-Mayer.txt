'''Maria Goeppert Mayer''' ({{IPA-de|maˈʁiːa ˈɡœpɛʁt ˈmaɪ̯ɐ|-|De-Maria Goeppert-Mayer.ogg}}; June 28, 1906 – February 20, 1972) was a German-born American [[theoretical physicist]], and [[Nobel laureate]] in [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Physics]] for proposing the [[nuclear shell model]] of the [[atomic nucleus]]. She was the second woman to win a Nobel Prize in physics, the first being [[Marie Curie]].  In 1986, the [[Maria Goeppert-Mayer Award]] for early-career women physicists was established in her honor.

A graduate of the [[University of Göttingen]], Goeppert Mayer wrote her doctoral thesis on the theory of possible [[two-photon absorption]] by atoms. At the time, the chances of experimentally verifying her thesis seemed remote, but the development of the [[laser]] permitted this. Today, the unit for the two-photon [[absorption cross section]] is named the Goeppert Mayer (GM) unit.

Maria Goeppert married [[Joseph Edward Mayer]] and moved to the United States, where he was an associate professor at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Strict rules against [[nepotism]] prevented Johns Hopkins University from taking her on as a faculty member, but she was given a job as an assistant and published a landmark paper on [[double beta decay]] in 1935. In 1937, she moved to [[Columbia University]], where she took an unpaid position. During [[World War II]], she worked for the [[Manhattan Project]] at Columbia on [[isotope separation]], and with  [[Edward Teller]] at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] on the development of the [[Teller's "Super" bomb]].

After the war, Goeppert Mayer became a voluntary associate professor of Physics at the [[University of Chicago]] (where her husband and Teller worked) and a senior physicist at the university-run [[Argonne National Laboratory]]. She developed a mathematical model for the structure of nuclear shells, for which she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963, which she shared with [[J. Hans D. Jensen]] and [[Eugene Wigner]]. In 1960, she was appointed full professor of physics at the [[University of California, San Diego]].

== Early life ==
Maria Göppert was born on June 28, 1906, in Kattowitz (now [[Katowice]], [[Poland]]), a [[Silesia]]n city in [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the only child of [[Friedrich Göppert]] and his wife Maria née Wolff.{{sfn|Ferry|2003|p=18}} In 1910, she moved with her family to [[Göttingen]] when her father,{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=311}} a sixth-generation university professor,{{sfn|Dash|1973|p=236}} was appointed as the professor of pediatrics at the [[University of Göttingen]].{{sfn|Ferry|2003|p=18}} Goeppert was closer to her father than her mother. "Well, my father was more interesting", she later explained. "He was after all a scientist".{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=312}}

Göppert was educated at the ''Höhere Technische'' in Göttingen, a school for middle-class girls who aspired to higher education.{{sfn|Ferry|2003|p=23}} In 1921, she entered the ''Frauenstudium'', a private high school run by [[suffragettes]] that aimed to prepare girls for university. She took the ''[[abitur]]'', the university entrance examination, at age 17, a year early, with three or four girls from her school and thirty boys. All the girls passed, but only one of the boys did.{{sfn|Dash|1973|pp=233–234}}

In the Spring of 1924, Göppert entered the University of Göttingen, where she studied mathematics.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=313}} A purported shortage of women mathematics teachers for schools for girls led to an upsurge of women studying mathematics at a time of high unemployment, and there was even a female professor of mathematics at Göttingen, [[Emmy Noether]], but most were only interested in qualifying for their teaching certificates.{{sfn|Dash|1973|p=250}}

Instead, Goeppert became interested in physics, and chose to pursue a [[Ph.D.]] In her 1930 doctoral thesis<ref name=Goeppert-Mayer_1931>{{cite journal | author =Goeppert-Mayer M | title = Über Elementarakte mit zwei Quantensprüngen | journal = Annals of Physics | year = 1931 | volume = 9 | issue =3| pages = 273–295 | bibcode=1931AnP...401..273G | doi = 10.1002/andp.19314010303 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Göppert-Mayer|first=M.|date=2009-08-11|title=Elementary processes with two quantum transitions|journal=Annalen der Physik|language=en|volume=18|issue=7–8|pages=466–479|doi=10.1002/andp.200910358|bibcode=2009AnP...521..466G}}</ref> she worked out the theory of possible [[two-photon absorption]] by atoms.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=313}} [[Eugene Wigner]] later described the thesis as "a masterpiece of clarity and concreteness".{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=314}} At the time, the chances of experimentally verifying her thesis seemed remote, but the development of the [[laser]] permitted the first experimental verification in 1961 when two-photon-excited fluorescence was detected in a [[europium]]-doped crystal.<ref>{{cite journal |first1=W. |last1=Kaiser |first2=C.G.B. |last2=Garrett |title=Two-photon excitation in CaF<sub>2</sub>:Eu<sup>2+</sup> |journal=Physical Review Letters |volume=7 |issue=6 |pages=229–232 |year=1961 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.7.229|bibcode = 1961PhRvL...7..229K }}</ref> To honor her fundamental contribution to this area, the unit for the two-photon [[absorption cross section]] is named the "GM".

On January 19, 1930, Goeppert married [[Joseph Edward Mayer]], an American [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller fellow]] who was one of James Franck's assistants.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|pp=311–312}}<ref>{{cite web | title=Maria Goeppert-Mayer | url=http://www.epigenesys.eu/en/science-and-you/women-in-science/811-maria-goeppert-mayer | publisher=EpiGeneSys | access-date=September 22, 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150117181423/http://www.epigenesys.eu/en/science-and-you/women-in-science/811-maria-goeppert-mayer | archive-date=January 17, 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref> The two had met when Mayer had boarded with the Goeppert family.{{sfn|Dash|1973|pp=258–259}} The couple moved to Mayer's home country of the United States, where he had been offered a position as associate professor of chemistry at [[Johns Hopkins University]].{{sfn|Dash|1973|p=265}} They had two children, Maria Ann (who later married [[Donat Wentzel]]) and Peter Conrad.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|pp=311–312}}

There was little interest in [[quantum mechanics]] at Johns Hopkins but Goeppert Mayer worked with [[Karl Herzfeld]] in this area. They collaborated on a number of papers, including a paper with Herzfeld's student A.L. Sklar on the spectrum of [[benzene]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org/research-profile/laureate-goeppert-mayer#page=all|title=Research Profile – Maria Goeppert Mayer|publisher=Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings|access-date=August 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Goeppert‐Mayer|first1=M.|last2=Sklar|first2=A.L.|date=1938|title=Calculations of the Lower Excited Levels of Benzene|journal=The Journal of Chemical Physics|language=en|volume=6|issue=10|pages=645–652|doi=10.1063/1.1750138|issn=0021-9606|bibcode=1938JChPh...6..645G}}</ref> She also returned to Göttingen in the summers of 1931, 1932 and 1933 to work with her former examiner Born, writing an article with him for the ''Handbuch der Physik''. This ended when the [[NSDAP|Nazi Party]] came to power in 1933, and many academics, including Born and Franck, lost their jobs. Goeppert Mayer and Herzfeld became involved in refugee relief efforts.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|pp=311–312}}{{sfn|Ferry|2003|pp=40–45}}

Joe Mayer was fired in 1937. He attributed this to the hatred of women on the part of the dean of physical sciences, which he thought was provoked by Goeppert Mayer's presence in the laboratory.{{sfn|Dash|1973|p=283}} Herzfeld agreed and added that, with Goeppert Mayer, Franck and Herzfeld all at Johns Hopkins, some thought that there were too many German scientists there. There were also complaints from some students that Mayer's chemistry lectures contained too much modern physics.{{sfn|Dash|1973|p=284}} Mayer took up a position at [[Columbia University]], where the chairman of the Physics Department, [[George B. Pegram]], arranged for Goeppert Mayer to have an office, but she received no salary. She soon made good friends with [[Harold Urey]] and [[Enrico Fermi]], who arrived at Columbia in 1939,{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=317}} with the three of them and their families living in nearby [[Leonia, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite book | title=Nobel Prize Women in Science: Their Lives, Struggles, and Momentous Discoveries | author-first=Sharon Bertsch | author-last=McGrayne | publisher=Joseph Henry Press | edition=Second | location=Washington, DC | year=1998 | pages=190–193}} Excerpt can also be seen as [https://www.sandiego.gov/sites/default/files/item_6-sr-2345_via_siena.pdf this attachment to a Report to the Historical Resources Board] of the City of San Diego, August 18, 2016.</ref> Fermi asked her to investigate the [[valence shell]] of the undiscovered [[transuranic elements]].

== Manhattan Project ==
[[File:HD.3A.050 (10481713035).jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Goeppert Mayer]]
In December 1941,  Goeppert Mayer took up her first paid professional position, teaching science part-time at [[Sarah Lawrence College]]. In the spring of 1942, with the United States embroiled in [[World War II]], she joined the [[Manhattan Project]]. She accepted a part-time research post from Urey with Columbia University's Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories. The objective of this project was to find a means of separating the [[fissile]] [[uranium-235]] isotope in natural uranium; she researched the chemical and thermodynamic properties of [[uranium hexafluoride]] and investigated the possibility of separating isotopes by photochemical reactions. This method proved impractical at the time, but the development of lasers would later open the possibility of [[separation of isotopes by laser excitation]].{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=318}}

Through her friend [[Edward Teller]], Goeppert Mayer was given a position at Columbia with the Opacity Project, which researched the  properties of matter and radiation at extremely high temperatures with an eye to the development of the [[Teller's "Super" bomb]], the wartime program for the development of [[thermonuclear weapon]]s.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=318}} In February 1945, Joe was sent to the [[Pacific War]], and Goeppert Mayer decided to leave her children in New York and join Teller's group at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]]. Joe came back from the Pacific earlier than expected, and they returned to New York together in July 1945.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=318}}{{sfn|Dash|1973|pp=296–299}}

In February 1946, Joe became a professor in the Chemistry Department and the new [[Institute for Nuclear Studies]] at the [[University of Chicago]], and Goeppert Mayer was able to become a voluntary associate professor of physics at the school. When Teller also accepted a position there, she was able to continue her Opacity work with him. When the nearby [[Argonne National Laboratory]] was founded on July 1, 1946, Goeppert Mayer was also offered a part-time job there as a senior physicist in the theoretical physics division. She responded, "I don't know anything about nuclear physics."{{sfn|Schiebinger|1999|p=59}}  She programmed the [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]]'s [[ENIAC]] to solve criticality problems for a [[liquid metal cooled reactor]] using the [[Monte Carlo method]].{{sfn|Sachs|1979|pp=319–320}}

During her time at Chicago and Argonne in the late 1940s, Goeppert Mayer developed a mathematical model for the structure of [[nuclear shell model|nuclear shells]], which she published in 1950.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=78 |issue=1 |pages=16–21 |date=April 1950 |last=Goeppert-Mayer |first=Maria |title=Nuclear configurations in the spin-orbit coupling model.

Theoretical Considerations |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.78.22|bibcode = 1950PhRv...78...22M }}</ref> Her model explained why certain numbers of nucleons in an atomic nucleus result in particularly stable configurations. These numbers are what Eugene Wigner called ''[[magic number (physics)|magic numbers]]'': 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, and 126. In an account relayed by Joe Mayer, Maria Goppert Mayer attained a critical insight while speaking with Enrico Fermi. {{quote|Fermi and Maria were talking in her office when Enrico was called out of the office to answer the telephone on a long distance call. At the door he turned and asked his question about spin-orbit coupling. He returned less than ten minutes later
and Maria started to 'snow' him with the detailed explanation. You may remember that Maria, when excited, had a rapid fire oral delivery, whereas Enrico always wanted a slow detailed and methodical explanation. Enrico smiled and left: 'Tomorrow, when you are less excited, you can explain it to me.'{{sfn|Sachs|1979|p=322}}}} 
She had realised that the nucleus is a series of closed shells and pairs of neutrons and protons tend to couple together.{{sfn|Sachs|1979|pp=320-321}}<ref name="nndb" /> She described the idea as follows:
{{quote|Think of a room full of waltzers. Suppose they go round the room in circles, each circle enclosed within another. Then imagine that in each circle, you can fit twice as many dancers by having one pair go clockwise and another pair go counterclockwise. Then add one more variation; all the dancers are spinning twirling round and round like tops as they circle the room, each pair both twirling and circling. But only some of those that go counterclockwise are twirling counterclockwise. The others are twirling clockwise while circling counterclockwise. The same is true of those that are dancing around clockwise: some twirl clockwise, others twirl counterclockwise.{{sfn|Dash|1973|p=316}}}}

Three German scientists, [[Otto Haxel]], [[J. Hans D. Jensen]], and [[Hans Suess]], were also working on solving the same problem, and arrived at the same conclusion independently. While their results were announced in an issue of the [[Physical Review]] before Goeppert Mayer in June 1949, Goeppert Mayer's work was received for review in February 1949, while the work of the German authors was received later in April 1949.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=75 |issue=11  |pages=1766 |date=June 1949|last1=Haxel |first1=Otto |author-link=Otto Haxel |last2=Jensen |first2=J.
