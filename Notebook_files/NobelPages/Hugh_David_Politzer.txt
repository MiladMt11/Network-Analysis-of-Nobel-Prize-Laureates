'''Hugh David Politzer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɑː|l|ɪ|t|s|ər}}; born August 31, 1949) is an American [[theoretical physics|theoretical physicist]] and the Richard Chace Tolman Professor of Theoretical Physics at the [[California Institute of Technology]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hugh D.

==Life and career==
Politzer was born in [[New York City]]. His parents, Alan and Valerie Politzer, both from [[Czechoslovakia]], immigrated to the U.S. after [[World War II]] and were both doctors. He graduated from the [[Bronx High School of Science]] in 1966, received his [[bachelor's degree]] from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1969, and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in 1974 from [[Harvard University]], where his graduate advisor was [[Sidney Coleman]].

In his first published article, which appeared in 1973, Politzer described the phenomenon of asymptotic freedom: the closer [[quark]]s are to each other, the weaker the [[strong interaction]] will be between them.<ref>

When quarks are in extreme proximity, the nuclear force between them is so weak that they behave almost like free particles. This result—independently discovered at around the same time by Gross and Wilczek at [[Princeton University]]—was extremely important in the development of [[quantum chromodynamics]]. With [[Thomas Appelquist]], Politzer also played a central role in predicting the existence of "[[charmonium]]", a subatomic particle formed of a [[charm quark]] and a [[antiparticle|charm antiquark]].

Politzer was a junior fellow at the [[Harvard Society of Fellows]] from 1974 to 1977 before moving to the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech), where he is currently professor of theoretical physics.  In 1989, he appeared in a minor role in the movie ''[[Fat Man and Little Boy]]'', as [[Manhattan Project]] physicist [[Robert Serber]].<ref>{{cite web|title=David Politzer Wins Nobel Prize in Physics {{!}} Caltech|url=http://www.caltech.edu/news/david-politzer-wins-nobel-prize-physics-895|website=The California Institute of Technology|access-date=3 December 2017|language=en}}</ref> The Nobel Prize in Physics 2004 was awarded jointly to [[David J. Gross]], H. David Politzer and [[Frank Wilczek]] "for the discovery of asymptotic freedom in the theory of the strong interaction."

Politzer is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President [[George W. Bush]] in May of 2008, urging him to "reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill" by requesting additional emergency funding for the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]’s [[Office of Science]], the [[National Science Foundation]], and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=A Letter from America's Physics Nobel Laureates|url=https://fire.pppl.gov/nobel_bush_fy08_050808.pdf}}</ref>

Politzer was elected as a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hugh David Politzer|url=https://www.amacad.org/person/hugh-david-politzer|website=American Academy of Arts & Sciences|language=en|access-date=2020-05-11}}</ref>

==Trivia==
Politzer was the lead vocalist in the 1980s for Professor Politzer and the Rho Mesons, which put out their single, "The Simple Harmonic Oscillator".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theory.caltech.edu/~politzer/SHO.mp3|title=The Simple Harmonic Oscillator|website=caltech.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://theory.caltech.edu/people/politzer/|title=David Politzer|work=caltech.edu}}</ref>

Politzer's [[Erdős-Bacon number]] is 5 – via appearing in ''Fat Man and Little Boy''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0097336/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm|title=Fat Man and Little Boy|website=imdb}}</ref> with Laura Dern (in ''[[Novocaine (film)|Novocaine]]'' with Kevin Bacon) and publishing once with Sidney Coleman ([[Erdős number#Two|Erdős number 2]]).
