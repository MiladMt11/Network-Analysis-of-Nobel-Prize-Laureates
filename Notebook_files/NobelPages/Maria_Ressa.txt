Ressa established the online news site [[Rappler]] in 2012 along with three other female founders and with a small team of 12 journalists and developers.

Ressa first interviewed [[Rodrigo Duterte]] the 16th president of [[Philippines]] in the 1980s when he was a mayor of [[Davao City|Davao]]. She again interviewed him in 2015 during his presidential election campaign where he confessed to killing three people when he was a mayor.<ref name="BBC News">{{Cite news|date=June 15, 2020|title=Who is Philippine news boss Maria Ressa?|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-49601038|access-date=June 19, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Ressa|first=Maria A.|title=Duterte, his 6 contradictions and planned dictatorship|url=http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/110679-duterte-contradictions-dictatorship|access-date=June 19, 2020|website=Rappler|language=en}}</ref> Under her leadership, Rappler has been consistently critical of Duterte's policies, especially his policies on the war on drugs with their stories demonstrating that the abuses were being carried out by the police with Duterte's approval. The website under her stewardship also wrote about the alleged pro-Duterte online "troll army" which according to their article, were pushing out fake news stories and manipulating the narrative around his presidency.<ref name="Ellis-Petersen"/>

In July 2017, in his State of Union speech, Duterte declared Rappler to be "fully owned" by the Americans and hence in violation of the constitution. He also said, "Not only is Rappler's news fake, it being Filipino is also fake." Subsequently, in August 2017, the Philippine securities and exchange commission (SEC) initiated an investigation against Rappler and demanded to check its documents. In January 2018, it revoked Rappler's license to do business.<ref>{{Cite web|title=SEC cancels Rappler's license to do business|url=https://cnnphilippines.com/news/2018/01/15/sec-revokes-rappler-license-to-operate.html|access-date=June 19, 2020|website=cnn|language=en}}</ref> The case went to the court of appeals, where it was remanded back to the SEC for having no basis.<ref>{{Cite web|date=June 15, 2020|title=Maria Ressa: everything you need to know about the Rappler editor|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/feb/14/maria-ressa-arrest-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-rappler-editor|access-date=June 19, 2020|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=January 15, 2018|title=Philippine news site has licence revoked|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-42692723|access-date=June 19, 2020}}</ref> Duterte told a Rappler reporter in 2018: "If you are trying to throw garbage at us, then the least that we can do is explain – how about you?

On February 13, 2019, Philippine judge Rainelda Estacio-Montesa of the Manila Regional Trial Court Branch #46 issued the arrest warrant for "cyber libel" against Ressa for an article published on Rappler. The officials of the Philippines National Bureau of Investigation fulfilled this warrant filed under the charge of cyber libel. The "cyber libel" law was passed after the article was originally published, so the charge was based on the technicality that fixing a typo might be considered "republishing".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mike|first=Navallo|date=June 14, 2020|title=How correcting a typo got Maria into trouble: The cyberlibel case vs Rappler|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/spotlight/06/14/20/how-correcting-a-typo-got-maria-into-trouble-the-cyberlibel-case-vs-rappler|access-date=June 14, 2020|website=ABS-CBN|language=en}}</ref> The arrest was live-streamed by many of Rappler's senior reporters on Facebook.<ref>{{Cite news|last=hermesauto|date=February 13, 2019|title=Philippines arrests top journalist and Duterte critic Maria Ressa on libel charge|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/philippines-arrests-journalist-maria-ressa-on-libel-charge|access-date=June 17, 2020|website=The Straits Times|language=en}}</ref>

Due to time constraints, Ressa was unable to post bail amounting to [[Philippine peso|₱]]60,000 ([[United States dollar|$]]1,150) resulting in her arrest and confinement within the (holding) board room office of the NBI building.

Ressa's arrest was criticized by the international community. As Ressa is an outspoken critic of President [[Rodrigo Duterte]], many viewed the arrest as being politically motivated.<ref name=timearrest>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/5529350/philippines-rappler-maria-ressa-bail/|title=Philippines Journalist Maria Ressa Released on Bail After Arrest for 'Cyber Libel'|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=February 14, 2019|first=Hillary|last=Leung|access-date=February 15, 2019}}</ref> In contrast, the official spokesperson for the [[Malacañang Palace]] denied any government involvement in the arrest, asserting that the lawsuit against Ressa was set forth by a private individual, the plaintiff Wilfredo Keng.<ref name=bbcarrest/>

[[Madeleine Albright]], a former [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]], issued an opinion stating that the arrest "must be condemned by all democratic nations".<ref name=bbcarrest>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-47235444|title=Maria Ressa, head of Philippines news site Rappler, freed on bail|work=[[BBC News]]|date=February 14, 2019|access-date=February 15, 2019}}</ref> Similarly, the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines called it "a shameless act of persecution by a bully government".<ref name=wapoarrest>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/top-philippine-journalist-and-time-person-of-the-year-arrested-on-libel-charges/2019/02/13/f05baf54-2f86-11e9-8ad3-9a5b113ecd3c_story.html|title=Top Philippine journalist and Time person of the year arrested on libel charges|work=[[The Washington Post]]|first=Regine|last=Cabato|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=February 15, 2019}}</ref>

The National Press Club, an organization accused of having close ties to the Duterte regime and with a long history of criticising the Rappler organization, has stated that the arrest was not harassment, and that Ressa should not be relegated to "the altar of press freedom for martyrdom".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2019/02/15/1893933/national-press-club-ressa-arrest-smacks-bad-taste-not-harassment|title=National Press Club: Ressa arrest 'smacks of bad taste,' but not harassment|website=philstar.com|access-date=February 17, 2019}}</ref> It also warned against politicizing the issue.<ref name=":0" />

Ressa's trial on charges of cyberlibel began in July 2019.

Ressa was found guilty on June 15, 2020.<ref name="guardianCyberLibel" /> In her ruling, Judge Rainelda Estacio-Montesa argued that Rappler "did not offer a scintilla of proof that they verified the imputations of various crimes in the disputed article...
