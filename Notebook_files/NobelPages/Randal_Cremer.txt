'''Sir William Randal Cremer''' (18 March 1828 – 22 July 1908) usually known by his middle name "Randal", was an [[England|English]] [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]], a [[pacifism|pacifist]], and a leading advocate for international arbitration. He was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1903 for his work with the [[international arbitration]] movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1903/cremer-bio.html|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1903 Randal Cremer|work=nobelprize.org}}</ref>

==Early life==
Cremer was born to a working-class family in the southern English town of [[Fareham]]. His father was a coachman, who abandoned the family soon after Randal Cremer was born. His mother raised him along with his two sisters, ensuring he received an education at a local [[Methodist]] school. He augmented his knowledge by attending free lectures, was apprenticed as a builder, and became a skilled [[carpenter]].<ref>{{cite DNB12|wstitle=Cremer, William Randal|volume=1}}</ref>

Moving to London 1852, Cremer became active as a union organiser, swiftly becoming a recognized labour leader. Cremer was elected as the Secretary of the [[International Workingmen's Association]] in 1865, but resigned two years later in 1867, when the organization decided to make women eligeable at their direction. Being strongly opposed to women's suffrage,<ref>Views of Anti-Suffrage MP William Cremer, The Times, April 1906</ref> this might have contributed to make him feel the organization was becoming too radical . While heavily involved in campaigning for progressive causes, and respected by [[Karl Marx|Marx]], Cremer did not agree with a worker led revolution.<ref name = "Mazower">

==Role in the international arbitration movement==
From as early as his first unsuccessful run for Parliament in 1868, Cremer had advocated the expansion of international arbitration as peaceful alternative to war for the resolution of disputes.<ref name = "Mazower"/>

He was elected as Liberal [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Haggerston (UK Parliament constituency)|Haggerston]] in the [[Shoreditch]] district of [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] from 1885 to 1895, and then from 1900 until his death from [[pneumonia]] in 1908.

Using his platform as an MP, Cremer cultivated allies on both continental Europe and across the Atlantic, including [[Frédéric Passy]], [[William Jennings Bryan]] and [[Andrew Carnegie]].  Using his network of contacts and his talent for organisation, Cremer did much to create and expand institutions for [[international arbitration]], which during his lifetime were successful in peacefully resolving numerous international disputes. This work includes co-founding the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] and the [[International Arbitration League]]; gaining acceptance for the 1897 [[Olney–Pauncefote Treaty]] between the United States and Britain that would have required arbitration of major disputes as the [[Essequibo (colony)|Essequibo]] territory (the treaty was rejected by the US Senate and never went into effect); and preparing the ground for the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague peace conferences of 1899 and 1907]].<ref name = "Mazower" />

In recognition of his work in the arbitration movement, Cremer won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], the first to do so solo, in 1903.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Winners|url=https://www.nobelpeaceprize.org/Prize-winners/Winners?page=10|access-date=2021-02-11|website=The Nobel Peace Prize|language=en-GB}}</ref>  Of the £8,000 award he donated £7,000 as an endowment for the [[International Arbitration League]].<ref name="CT" />

He also was named a Chevalier of the [[France|French]] [[Légion d'honneur]],<ref>Among the world's peacemakers: an epitome of the [[Interparliamentary Union]] edited by Hayne Davis, 1908</ref> won the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav|Knighthood of Saint Olaf]]  and was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1907.
