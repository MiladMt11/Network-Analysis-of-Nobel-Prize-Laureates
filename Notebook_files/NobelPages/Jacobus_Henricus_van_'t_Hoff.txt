'''Jacobus Henricus '''"'''Henry'''"''' van 't Hoff Jr.''' ({{IPA-nl|vɑn (ə)t ˈɦɔf|lang}}; 30 August 1852 – 1 March 1911) was a Dutch [[physical chemistry|physical chemist]]. A highly influential [[theoretical chemistry|theoretical chemist]] of his time, Van&nbsp;'t Hoff was the first winner of the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=van't Hoff, Jacobus Hendricus}}</ref><ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1901/hoff-lecture.html Nobel Lecture] ''Osmotic Pressure and Chemical Equilibrium'' from Nobelprize.org website</ref><ref>{{cite web |editor-first=Karl |editor-last=Grandin | title=Jacobus Henricus van 't Hoff Biography | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1901/hoff-bio.html | work=Les Prix Nobel | publisher=The Nobel Foundation | access-date=15 August 2008}}</ref> His pioneering work helped found the modern theory of [[chemical affinity]], [[chemical equilibrium]], [[chemical kinetics]], and [[chemical thermodynamics]]. In his 1874 pamphlet Van 't Hoff formulated the theory of the tetrahedral carbon atom and laid the foundations of [[stereochemistry]]. In 1875, he predicted the correct structures of [[allenes]] and [[cumulene]]s as well as their axial [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]].<ref>''La Chemie dans l'Espace'', Bazendijk: Rotterdam, 1875</ref> He is also widely considered one of the founders of [[physical chemistry]] as the discipline is known today.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Meijer |first=E.

==Biography==
The third of seven children, Van&nbsp;'t Hoff was born in [[Rotterdam]], Netherlands, 30 August 1852. His father was Jacobus Henricus van&nbsp;'t Hoff Sr., a physician, and his mother was Alida Kolff van 't Hoff.<ref>{{Nobelprize}}</ref>  From a young age, he was interested in science and nature, and frequently took part in botanical excursions. In his early school years, he showed a strong interest in poetry and [[philosophy]]. He considered [[Lord Byron]] to be his idol.

Against the wishes of his father, Van&nbsp;'t Hoff chose to study [[chemistry]]. First, he enrolled at [[Delft University of Technology]] in September 1869, and studied until 1871, when he passed his final exam on 8 July and obtained a degree of [[Industrial technology|chemical technologist]].<ref name="Snelders">{{cite book|title=De geschiedenis van de scheikunde in Nederland.

He then studied in [[Bonn]], Germany, with [[Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz|Friedrich Kekulé]] and in Paris with [[Charles Adolphe Wurtz|C. A. Wurtz]]. He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] under Eduard Mulder at the [[Utrecht University|University of Utrecht]] in 1874.<ref>[http://dap.library.uu.nl/cgi-bin/dap/dap?diss_id=7506 Entry in Digital Album Promotorum] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724171949/http://dap.library.uu.nl/cgi-bin/dap/dap?diss_id=7506 |date=24 July 2011 }} of [[Utrecht University]]</ref>

In 1878, Van&nbsp;'t Hoff married Johanna Francina Mees. They had two daughters, Johanna Francina (1880–1964) and Aleida Jacoba (1882–1971), and two sons, Jacobus Henricus van&nbsp;'t Hoff III (1883–1943) and Govert Jacob (1889–1918). Van&nbsp;'t Hoff died at the age of 58, on 1 March 1911, at [[Steglitz]], near Berlin, of [[tuberculosis]].

===Organic chemistry===
Van 't Hoff earned his earliest reputation in the field of [[organic chemistry]]. In 1874, he accounted for the phenomenon of [[optical activity]] by assuming that the [[chemical bond]]s between [[carbon]] [[atom]]s and their neighbors were directed towards the corners of a regular [[tetrahedron]].<ref>*Van 't Hoff (3 September 1874) ''Voorstel tot Uitbreiding der Tegenwoordige in de Scheikunde gebruikte Structuurformules in de Ruimte, benevens een daarmee samenhangende Opmerking omtrent het Verband tusschen Optisch Actief Vermogen en chemische Constitutie van Organische Verbindingen'' (Proposal for the Extension of Current Chemical Structural Formulas into Space, together with Related Observation on the Connection between Optically Active Power and the Chemical Constitution of Organic Compounds) [pamphlet published by the author].  Available in English at:  [http://www.chemteam.info/Chem-History/Van't-Hoff-1874.html ChemTeam].
*  Reprinted in French in:  J.H. van 't Hoff (1874) [https://books.google.com/books?id=bXc7AQAAIAAJ&pg=PA445#v=onepage&q&f=false "Sur les formules de structure dans l'espace,"] ''Archives neerlandaises des sciences exactes et naturelles'', '''9''':445–454.</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_L9DcGiXyc Planar Methane – Periodic Table of Videos]. YouTube. Retrieved on 30 December 2015.</ref> This three-dimensional structure accounted for the [[isomer]]s found in nature. He shares credit for this  with the French chemist [[Joseph Le Bel]], who independently came up with the same idea.

Three months before his doctoral degree was awarded, Van&nbsp;'t Hoff published this theory, which today is regarded as the foundation of [[stereochemistry]], first in a Dutch pamphlet in the fall of 1874, and then in the following May in a small French book entitled ''La chimie dans l'espace''. A German translation appeared in 1877, at a time when the only job Van&nbsp;'t Hoff could find was at the Veterinary School in Utrecht.  In these early years his theory was largely ignored by the scientific community, and was sharply criticized by one prominent chemist, [[Hermann Kolbe]]. Kolbe wrote:
<blockquote>"A Dr. J. H. van 't Hoff of the Veterinary School at Utrecht has no liking, apparently, for exact chemical investigation. He has considered it more convenient to mount Pegasus (apparently borrowed from the Veterinary School) and to proclaim in his ''‘La chimie dans l’espace’'' how, in his bold flight to the top of the chemical Parnassus, the atoms appeared to him to be arranged in cosmic space."</blockquote>  However, by about 1880 support for Van&nbsp;'t Hoff's theory by such important chemists as [[Johannes Wislicenus]] and [[Viktor Meyer]] brought recognition.

===Physical chemistry===
In 1884, Van 't Hoff published his research on chemical kinetics, titled ''Études de Dynamique chimique'' (''"Studies in Chemical Dynamics"''), in which he described a new method for determining the [[Order (chemistry)|order of a reaction]] using [[graphics]] and applied the laws of [[thermodynamics]] to chemical equilibria. He also introduced the modern concept of [[chemical affinity]]. In 1886, he showed a similarity between the behaviour of dilute solutions and gases. In 1887, he and German chemist [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] founded an influential scientific magazine named  ''Zeitschrift für physikalische Chemie'' ("''Journal of Physical Chemistry''"). He worked on [[Svante Arrhenius]]'s theory of the dissociation of [[electrolytes]] and in 1889 provided physical justification for the [[Arrhenius equation]]. In 1896, he became a professor at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] in Berlin. His studies of the salt deposits at [[Stassfurt]] were an important contribution to Prussia's chemical industry.

[[File:Van 't Hoff und Ostwald 01.jpg|right|thumb|300px|J.H. van&nbsp;'t Hoff with [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] (right)]]

Van 't Hoff became a lecturer in chemistry and physics at the [[Veterinary medicine|Veterinary]] College in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. He then worked as a professor of chemistry, [[mineralogy]], and [[geology]] at the [[University of Amsterdam]] for almost 18 years before eventually becoming the chairman of the chemistry department. In 1896, Van&nbsp;'t Hoff moved to Germany, where he finished his career at the [[University of Berlin]] in 1911. In 1901, he received the first [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his work with solutions. His work showed that very dilute solutions follow mathematical laws that closely resemble the laws describing the behavior of [[gas]]es.

==Honours and awards==
In 1885, Van 't Hoff was appointed as a Member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00000882 |title=Jacobus Hendrik van 't Hoff (1852–1911) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |access-date=17 July 2015}}</ref> In 1904, he was elected as a member to the [[American Philosophical Society]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=APS Member History|url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=1904&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced|access-date=2021-06-28|website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref> Other distinctions include honorary doctorates from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Yale University|Yale]] (1901), [[Victoria University (UK)|Victoria University]], the [[University of Manchester]] (1903), and [[University of Heidelberg]] (1908). He was awarded the [[Davy Medal]] of the [[Royal Society]] in 1893 (along with [[Joseph Le Bel|Le Bel]]), and elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1897|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1897]]. He was awarded the [[Helmholtz Medal]] of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]] (1911), and appointed Knight of the French [[Legion of Honour]] (1894) and Senator in the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society|Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft]] (1911). Van&nbsp;'t Hoff became an Honorary Member of the [[British Chemical Society]] in London, the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (1892), [[American Chemical Society]] (1898), the [[Académie des Sciences]] in Paris (1905), and the [[Royal Netherlands Chemical Society|Netherlands Chemical Society]] (1908). Of his numerous distinctions, Van&nbsp;'t Hoff regarded winning the first Nobel Prize in Chemistry as the culmination of his career.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1901/hoff/biographical/ |title=Jacobus Hendrik van 't Hoff – Biographical|access-date=1 September 2019}}</ref> The following are named after him:
* [[Van 't Hoff factor]]
* [[Van 't Hoff equation]]
* [[Le Bel–Van 't Hoff rule]]
