'''Sir William Ramsay''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KCB|FRS|FRSE}} ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|æ|m|z|i}}; 2 October 1852&nbsp;– 23 July 1916) was a Scottish chemist who discovered the [[noble gases]] and received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1904 "in recognition of his services in the discovery of the inert gaseous elements in air" along with his collaborator, [[John William Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh]], who received the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] that same year for their discovery of [[argon]]. After the two men identified argon, Ramsay investigated other atmospheric gases. His work in isolating argon, [[helium]], [[neon]], [[krypton]] and [[xenon]] led to the development of a new section of the [[periodic table]].<ref name="Wood">{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Margaret E.|title=A Tale of Two Knights|journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine |date=2010|volume=28|issue=1|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/a-tale-of-two-knights|access-date=22 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://newsd.in/who-was-sir-william-ramsay-scottish-chemist-167th-birthday-google-doodle/|title=Sir William Ramsay's 167th birthday|work=Newsd www.newsd.in|access-date=2 October 2019|language=en}}</ref>

==Early years==
Ramsay was born at 2 Clifton Street<ref name="auto">Glasgow Post Office Directory 1852</ref> in [[Glasgow]] on 2 October 1852, the son of civil engineer and surveyor,  William C. Ramsay, and his wife, Catherine Robertson.<ref name="Waterston2">{{cite book|last1=Waterston|first1=Charles D|last2=Macmillan Shearer|first2=A|title=Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002: Biographical Index|url=http://www.rse.org.uk/fellowship/fells_indexp2.pdf|access-date=25 November 2011|volume=II|date=July 2006|publisher=[[The Royal Society of Edinburgh]]|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-902198-84-5|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004113303/http://www.rse.org.uk/fellowship/fells_indexp2.pdf|archive-date=4 October 2006}}</ref> The family lived at 2 Clifton Street in the city centre, a three-storey and basement Georgian townhouse.<ref name="auto"/> The family moved to 1 Oakvale Place in the [[Hillhead]] district in his youth.<ref>Glasgow Post Office Directory 1860</ref> He was a nephew of the [[geologist]] [[Andrew Ramsay (geologist)|Sir Andrew Ramsay]].

He was educated at [[Glasgow Academy]] and then apprenticed to Robert Napier, shipbuilder in [[Govan]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0-902-198-84-X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}</ref> However, he instead decided to study Chemistry at the [[University of Glasgow]], matriculating in 1866 and graduating 1869. He then undertook practical training with the chemist [[Thomas Anderson (chemist)|Thomas Anderson]] and then went to study in Germany at the [[University of Tübingen]] with [[Wilhelm Rudolph Fittig]] where his doctoral thesis was entitled ''Investigations in the [[Toluene|Toluic]] and [[mononitrotoluene|Nitrotoluic]] Acids''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i736QAAACAAJ|title=Investigations on the Toluic, and Nitrotoluic Acids|last=Ramsay|first=William|date=1872|publisher=Print. by Fues|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sir William Ramsay Biographical |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1904/ramsay/biographical/ |website=The Nobel Prize |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |access-date=2 October 2019}}</ref><ref name="GB 103 RAMSAY">{{cite web |title=Ramsay Papers |url=https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/1b85ca7d-4b61-327f-81a3-47b673dcdbb9 |website=Jisc Archive Hub |publisher=University College London Archives |access-date=2 October 2019}}</ref>

Ramsay went back to Glasgow as Anderson's assistant at the [[University of Strathclyde|Anderson College]]. He was appointed as Professor of Chemistry at the [[University College, Bristol|University College of Bristol]] in 1879 and married Margaret Buchanan in 1881. In the same year he became the Principal of University College, Bristol, and somehow managed to combine that with active research both in [[organic chemistry]] and on gases.

==Career==

In 1887 he succeeded [[Alexander William Williamson|Alexander Williamson]] as the chair of Chemistry at [[University College London]] (UCL). It was here at UCL that his most celebrated discoveries were made. As early as 1885–1890 he published several notable papers on the [[oxide]]s of [[nitrogen]], developing the skills that he needed for his subsequent work.

On the evening of 19 April 1894 Ramsay attended a lecture given by [[Lord Rayleigh]]. Rayleigh had noticed a discrepancy between the density of nitrogen made by [[chemical synthesis]] and nitrogen isolated from the air by removal of the other known components. After a short conversation he and Ramsay decided to investigate this. In August Ramsay told Rayleigh he had isolated a new, heavy component of air, which did not appear to have any [[Reactivity (chemistry)|chemical reactivity]]. He named this inert gas "[[argon]]", from the Greek word meaning "lazy".<ref name="Wood"/> In the following years, working with [[Morris Travers]], he discovered [[neon]], [[krypton]], and [[xenon]]. He also isolated [[helium]], which had only been observed in the [[Sun#Observation and ugly effects|spectrum]] of the sun, and had not previously been found on earth. In 1910 he isolated and characterised [[radon]].<ref>{{cite journal| title = La densité de l'emanation du radium| author = W. Ramsay and R. W. Gray| journal =  C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris| volume = 151| pages = 126–128| year = 1910| url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k31042/f126.table }}</ref>

During 1893–1902 Ramsay collaborated with [[Emily Aston]], a British chemist, in experiments on mineral analysis and atomic weight determination. Their work included publications on the molecular surface energies of mixtures of non-associating liquids.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ladies in the Laboratory? American and British Women in Science, 1800–1900: A survey of their contributions to research.|last=Creese|first=M. R. S.|publisher=Scarecrow|year=1998|location=Lanham, MD|pages=265}}</ref>

He was appointed a Knight Commander of the [[Order of the Bath]] (KCB) in the [[1902 Coronation Honours]] list published on 26 June 1902,<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=The Coronation Honours |day_of_week=Thursday |date=26 June 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36804}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27453 |date=11 July 1902 |page=4441}}</ref> and invested as such by King [[Edward VII]] at [[Buckingham Palace]] on 24 October 1902.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Court Circular |day_of_week=Saturday |date=25 October 1902 |page_number=8 |issue=36908}}</ref>

In 1904 Ramsay received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].
Ramsay's standing among scientists led him to become an adviser to the [[Indian Institute of Science]]. He suggested [[Bangalore]] as the location for the institute.

Ramsay endorsed the Industrial and Engineering Trust Ltd., a company that claimed it could extract [[gold]] from [[seawater]], in 1905. It bought property on the English coast to begin its secret process. The company never produced any gold.

Ramsay was the president of the [[British Science Association|British Association]] in 1911–1912.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/reportofbritisha12scie|title=Report of the British Association for the Advancement of Science|date=2 October 1912|publisher=London : John Murray|website=Archive.org|access-date=2 October 2019}}</ref>

==Personal life==
In 1881 Ramsay was married to Margaret Johnstone Marshall (née Buchanan), daughter of George Stevenson Buchanan. They had a daughter, Catherine Elizabeth (Elska) and a son, William George, who died at 40.

Ramsay lived in [[Hazlemere]], [[Buckinghamshire]], until his death. He died in [[High Wycombe]], Buckinghamshire, on 23 July 1916 from [[Nasopharynx cancer|nasal cancer]] at the age of 63 and was buried in Hazlemere [[parish church]].

==Legacy==
A [[blue plaque]] at number 12 [[Arundel Gardens]], [[Notting Hill]], commemorates his life and work.

The [[Sir William Ramsay School]] in Hazlemere and [[Ramsay grease]] are named after him.

There is a memorial to him by [[Charles Hartwell]] in the north aisle of the choir at [[Westminster Abbey]].<ref>'The Abbey Scientists' Hall, A.R. p63: London; Roger & Robert Nicholson; 1966</ref>

In 1923, [[University College London]] named its new Chemical Engineering department and seat after Ramsay, which had been funded by the Ramsay Memorial Fund.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/chemical-engineering/about/history|title='' History – UCL Chemical Engineering has a long and distinguished history as a world-leading research department – the first of its kind in the UK.

Watson]] was the third Ramsay professor of chemical engineering. 

On 2 October 2019, [[Google]] celebrated his 167th birthday with a [[Google Doodle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/sir-william-ramsays-167th-birthday|title=Sir William Ramsay's 167th Birthday|website=Google|date=2 October 2019}}</ref>
