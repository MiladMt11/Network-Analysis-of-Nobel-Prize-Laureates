== Education and early life ==
{{no refs|section|date=January 2021}}
Abrikosov was born in [[Moscow]], [[Russian SFSR]], Soviet Union, on June 25, 1928, to a couple of [[physician]]s: [[Aleksey Abrikosov]] and Fani Abrikosova, née Wulf, a Jewish Russian physician. He graduated from [[Moscow State University]] in 1948. From 1948 to 1965, he worked at the Institute for Physical Problems of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]], where he received his Ph.D. in 1951 for the theory of thermal diffusion in [[Plasma (physics)|plasmas]], and then his [[Doctor of Science|Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences]] (a "higher doctorate") degree in 1955 for a thesis on [[quantum electrodynamics]] at high energies.

==Career==
From 1965 to 1988, he worked at the [[Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics]] (USSR Academy of Sciences). He has been a professor at Moscow State University since 1965. In addition, he held tenure at the [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]] from 1972 to 1976, and at the [[Moscow Institute of Steel and Alloys]] from 1976 to 1991. He served as a full member of the USSR Academy of Sciences from 1987 to 1991. In 1991, he became a full member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].

In two works in 1952 and 1957, Abrikosov explained how [[magnetic flux]] can penetrate a class of [[superconductors]]. This class of materials are called [[type-II superconductors]]. The accompanying arrangement of magnetic flux lines is called the [[Abrikosov vortex]] lattice.

Together with [[Lev Gor'kov]] and Igor Dzyaloshinskii, Abrikosov has written an iconic book on theoretical [[solid-state physics]], which has been used to train physicists in the field for decades. 

From 1991 until his retirement, he worked at [[Argonne National Laboratory]] in the U.S. state of [[Illinois]]. Abrikosov was an Argonne Distinguished Scientist at the Condensed Matter Theory Group in Argonne's Materials Science Division. When he received the Nobel Prize, his research was focused on the origins of magnetoresistance, a property of some materials that change their resistance to electrical flow under the influence of a magnetic field.<ref>[http://chemistry.anl.gov/MSDReview/Superconductivity/Abrikosov.pdf  Abrikosov, A.

== Honours and awards ==
Abrikosov was awarded the [[Lenin Prize]] in 1966, the [[Fritz London]] Memorial Prize in 1972, and the [[USSR State Prize]] in 1982. In 1989 he received the Landau Prize from the Academy of Sciences, Russia.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Two years later, in 1991, Abrikosov was awarded the Sony Corporation's John Bardeen Award. The same year he was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=20 March 2011}}</ref> He shared the 2003 Nobel Prize in Physics. He was also a member of the Royal Academy of London, a fellow of the American Physical Society, and in 2000 was elected to the prestigious National Academy of Sciences.<ref name=nas/> Other awards include:
