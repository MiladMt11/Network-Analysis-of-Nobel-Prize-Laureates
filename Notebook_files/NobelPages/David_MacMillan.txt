==Education and early life==
MacMillan was born in [[Bellshill]], Scotland in 1968 and grew in nearby [[New Stevenston]].<ref name="BBC"/> He attended the local state-funded schools, New Stevenston Primary and Bellshill Academy and credited his Scottish education for his success.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Success wouldn’t have happened if I wasn’t Scottish, says Bellshill-born Nobel Prize winner|url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/business_hq/19631329.professor-david-wc-macmillan-success-wouldnt-happened-wasnt-scottish/|access-date=2021-11-09|website=HeraldScotland|language=en}}</ref> He received his undergraduate degree in chemistry at the [[University of Glasgow]], where he worked with Ernie Colvin.<ref>{{cite news |title=Bellshill man and former Glasgow University student David WC MacMillan wins the Nobel prize for chemistry|url=https://www.glasgowtimes.co.uk/news/19630090.bellshill-man-former-glasgow-university-student-david-wc-macmillan-wins-nobel-prize-chemistry/ |access-date=7 October 2021 |work=Glasgow Times}}</ref><ref name=nas>{{cite web |title=David MacMillan |url=http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/members/20044093.html |publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]] |access-date=7 October 2021}}</ref>

In 1990, he left the UK to begin his doctoral studies under the direction of Professor [[Larry Overman]] at the [[University of California, Irvine]]. During this time, he focused on the development of new reaction methodology directed toward the stereocontrolled formation of bicyclic [[tetrahydrofuran]]s. MacMillan's graduate studies culminated in the total synthesis of {{nowrap|7-(−)-deacetoxyalcyonin}} acetate, a eunicellin [[Terpenoid|diterpenoid]] isolated from the soft coral ''Eunicella stricta''.<ref>{{Cite thesis |title=Stereocontrolled formation of bicyclic tetrahydrofurans ; and, Enantioselective total synthesis of eunicellin diterpenes |oclc=35966904 |date=1996 |first=David William Cross |last=MacMillan  |id={{ProQuest|304225710}} |institution=[[University of California, Irvine]] |degree=Ph.D.}}</ref> He earned his Ph.D. in 1996.<ref name=nas />

He hailed his Scottish upbringing as a reason for his winning the Nobel.<ref name="BBC">{{Cite news|date=7 October 2021|title=David MacMillan: 'Being Scottish helped me win Nobel Prize'|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-58828279|access-date=7 October 2021}}</ref>

==Career and research==
Upon receiving his [[Ph.D]]., MacMillan accepted a position with Professor [[David A. Evans|David Evans]] at [[Harvard University]]. His postdoctoral studies centered on enantioselective catalysis, in particular, the design and development of [[Tin|Sn(II)]]-derived [[Bisoxazoline ligand|bisoxazoline]] complexes (Sn(II)box).<ref name=nas />

MacMillan began his independent research career as a member of the chemistry faculty at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in July 1998. He joined the department of chemistry at [[Caltech]] in June 2000, where his group's research interests centered on new approaches to enantioselective catalysis. In 2004, he was appointed as the [[Earle C. Anthony]] Professor of Chemistry. He became the James S. McDonnell Distinguished University Professor at [[Princeton University]] in September 2006.<ref name=nas />

He is considered to be one of the founders of [[organocatalysis]].<ref name="Castelvecchi Stoye p. " /> In 2000, MacMillan designed small organic molecules that can provide or accept electrons and therefore efficiently catalyse reactions.<ref name="Castelvecchi Stoye p.
