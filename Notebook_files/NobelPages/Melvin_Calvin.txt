== Life ==
Calvin was born in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], the son of Elias Calvin and Rose Herwitz,<ref name="royalsoced.org.uk">{{Cite web |url=http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 23, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919152306/https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf |archive-date=September 19, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Jewish immigrants from the [[Russian Empire]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1961/calvin-bio.html|title = The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1961}}</ref>

As a small child Calvin's family moved to [[Detroit]]; he graduated from [[Central High School (Detroit, Michigan)|Central High School]] in 1928.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/melvin-calvin/|title=Melvin Calvin Summary}}</ref> Melvin Calvin earned his Bachelor of Science from the [[Michigan College of Mining and Technology]] (now known as [[Michigan Technological University]]) in 1931 and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in chemistry from the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1935. He then spent the next four years doing postdoctoral work at the [[University of Manchester]]. He married Marie Genevieve Jemtegaard in 1942,<ref name="royalsoced.org.uk"/> and they had three children, two daughters and a son.

Calvin joined the faculty at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in 1937 and was promoted to Professor of Chemistry in 1947. Using the [[carbon-14]] isotope as a tracer, Calvin, [[Andrew Benson]] and [[James Bassham]] mapped the complete route that carbon travels through a plant during [[photosynthesis]], starting from its absorption as atmospheric carbon dioxide to its conversion into carbohydrates and other organic compounds.<ref>{{Cite news

}}</ref> In doing so, Calvin, Benson and Bassham showed that sunlight acts on the [[chlorophyll]] in a plant to fuel the manufacturing of organic compounds, rather than on [[carbon dioxide]] as was previously believed. Calvin was the sole recipient of the 1961 Nobel Prize for Chemistry for what is sometimes known as the [[Calvin cycle|Calvin–Benson–Bassham]] Cycle. Calvin wrote an autobiography three decades later titled ''Following the Trail of Light: A Scientific Odyssey''.<ref>{{cite book

During the 1950s he was among the first members of the [[Society for General Systems Research]]. In 1963 he was given the additional title of Professor of Molecular Biology. He was founder and Director of the Laboratory of Chemical Biodynamics and simultaneously Associate Director of [[Berkeley Radiation Laboratory]], where he conducted much of his research until his retirement in 1980. In his final years of active research, he studied the use of oil-producing plants as renewable sources of energy. He also spent many years testing the chemical evolution of life and wrote a book on the subject that was published in 1969.<ref>Calvin, Melvin.

== Controversy ==
In his 2011 television history of Botany for the [[BBC]], [[Timothy Walker (botanist)|Timothy Walker]], Director of the [[University of Oxford Botanic Garden]], criticised Calvin's treatment of [[Andrew Benson]], claiming that Calvin had got the credit for Benson's work after firing him, and had failed to mention Benson's role when writing his autobiography decades later.<ref name="bbc4">{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b011wz4q|author=Walker, Timothy | title=Botany: A Blooming History | work=[[BBC Four]] | year=2011 | publisher=[[BBC]], UK | access-date=June 17, 2014|author-link=Timothy Walker (botanist) }}</ref> Benson himself has also mentioned being fired by Calvin, and has complained about not being mentioned in his autobiography.<ref name="BensonTranscript">{{cite web | url=http://cnr.berkeley.edu/release/BensonInterviewTranscript.pdf|author=Interview conducted by Bob B.

It makes the whole volume about him getting a Nobel Prize, no mention of Benson at all in that book. And he didn't have to do that. He could have done it right. And finally, one of his last publications he mentioned – Dr. Benson and some graduate students were involved – but just briefly mentioned.}}</ref>

== Honours and Legacy ==
Calvin was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1958.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00004527 |title=Melvin Calvin (1911 - 1997) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |access-date=5 October 2016}}</ref> In 1959 he was elected a Member of the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leopoldina.org/en/members/list-of-members/member/3133/|title=List of Members|website=www.leopoldina.org|access-date=19 October 2017}}</ref>

In 1971, Calvin was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) degree from [[Whittier College]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whittier.edu/alumni/poetnation/honorary|title=Honorary Degrees {{!}} Whittier College|website=www.whittier.edu|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref>

Calvin was featured on the 2011 volume of the ''American Scientists'' collection of US postage stamps, along with [[Asa Gray]], [[Maria Goeppert-Mayer]], and [[Severo Ochoa]]. This was the third volume in the series, the first two having been released in 2005 and 2008.
