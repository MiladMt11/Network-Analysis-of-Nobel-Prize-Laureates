In a speech at [[Cairo University]] on June 4, 2009, US President [[Barack Obama]] proclaimed a new Science Envoy program as part of a "new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thomas|first=John Meurig|date=2019-12-30|title=Ahmed Hassan Zewail. 26 February 1946—2 August 2016|journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society|volume=68|pages=431–453|doi=10.1098/rsbm.2019.0040|doi-access=free}}</ref> In January 2010, Ahmed Zewail, [[Elias Zerhouni]], and [[Bruce Alberts]] became the first US science envoys to Islam, visiting Muslim-majority countries from North Africa to Southeast Asia.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pellerin, Cheryl|title=First U.S. Science Envoys Begin Work in Muslim-Majority Countries|date=16 February 2010|url=http://www.america.gov/st/scitech-english/2010/February/20100115082753lcnirellep0.1611902.html|publisher=America.gov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226074643/http://www.america.gov/st/scitech-english/2010/February/20100115082753lcnirellep0.1611902.html|archive-date=26 February 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

When asked about rumors that he might contest the [[Egyptian presidential election, 2011|2011 Egyptian presidential election]], Ahmed Zewail said: "I am a frank man... I have no political ambition, as I have stressed repeatedly that I only want to serve Egypt in the field of science and die as a scientist."<ref>{{cite news|title=Obituary: Envoy to science|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/NewsQ/17029.aspx|newspaper=Al-Ahram Weekly|date=4 August 2016|access-date=9 August 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919195122/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/NewsQ/17029.aspx|archive-date=19 September 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|publisher=Chemical Physics Letters|title=Obituary: AHMED HASSAN ZEWAIL (1946–2016)|url=http://www.journals.elsevier.com/chemical-physics-letters/news/obituary-ahmed-hassan-zewail-1946-2016|access-date=9 August 2016}}</ref>

During the [[2011 Egyptian protests]] he announced his return to the country.
