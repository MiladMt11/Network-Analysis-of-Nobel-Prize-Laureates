Marconi was also an entrepreneur, businessman, and founder of [[Marconi Company|The Wireless Telegraph & Signal Company]] in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] in 1897 (which became the [[Marconi Company]]). In 1929, Marconi was ennobled as a ''[[Marquess|Marchese]]'' (marquis) by [[King Victor Emmanuel III]] of Italy, and, in 1931, he set up [[Vatican Radio]] for [[Pope Pius XI]].

==Biography==

===Early years===
Marconi was born into the Italian nobility as '''Guglielmo Giovanni Maria Marconi'''<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=QA0oAQAAIAAJ&q= ''Atti della Accademia di scienze, lettere e arti di Palermo: Scienze''], Presso l'accademia, 1974, p. 11.</ref> in [[Palazzo Dall'Armi Marescalchi, Bologna|Palazzo Marescalchi]] in [[Bologna]] on 25 April 1874, the second son of Giuseppe Marconi (an Italian aristocratic landowner from [[Porretta Terme]]) and his [[Irish people|Irish]] wife Annie Jameson (daughter of Andrew Jameson of Daphne Castle in [[County Wexford]], [[Ireland]], and granddaughter of John Jameson, founder of [[whiskey]] distillers [[Jameson Irish Whiskey|Jameson & Sons]]).<ref>Sexton, Michael (2005) ''Marconi: the Irish connection.''

At the age of 18 and back in Bologna, Marconi became acquainted with [[University of Bologna]] physicist [[Augusto Righi]], who had done research on [[Heinrich Hertz]]'s work. Righi permitted Marconi to attend lectures at the university and also to use the University's laboratory and library.<ref>[http://www.scienzagiovane.unibo.it/English/scientists/marconi-1.html Guglielmo Marconi (Fabrizio Bònoli, Giorgio Dragoni)]. Scienzagiovane.unibo.it. Retrieved on 10 June 2016.</ref>

===Radio work===
From youth, Marconi was interested in science and electricity. In the early 1890s, he began working on the idea of "[[wireless telegraphy]]"—i.e., the transmission of telegraph messages without connecting wires as used by the [[electric telegraph]]. This was not a new idea; numerous investigators and inventors had been exploring wireless telegraph technologies and even building systems using electric [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conduction]], [[electromagnetic induction]] and optical (light) signalling for over 50 years, but none had proven technically and commercially successful. A relatively new development came from [[Heinrich Hertz]], who, in 1888, demonstrated that one could produce and detect [[electromagnetic radiation]], based on the work of [[James Clerk Maxwell]]. At the time, this radiation was commonly called "Hertzian" waves, and is now generally referred to as [[radio waves]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://earlyradiohistory.us/sec022.htm|title=22. Word Origins|work=earlyradiohistory.us}}</ref>

There was a great deal of interest in radio waves in the physics community, but this interest was in the scientific phenomenon, not in its potential as a communication method.  Physicists generally looked on radio waves as an invisible form of light that could only travel along a [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] path, limiting its range to the visual horizon like existing forms of visual signaling.<ref>Regal, Brian (2005) ''Radio: The Life Story of a Technology''. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 22. {{ISBN|0313331677}}</ref> Hertz's death in 1894 brought published reviews of his earlier discoveries including a demonstration on the transmission and detection of radio waves by the British physicist [[Oliver Lodge]] and an article about Hertz's work by Augusto Righi. Righi's article renewed Marconi's interest in developing a wireless telegraphy system based on radio waves,<ref>[[#Hong|Hong]], p. 19</ref> a line of inquiry that Marconi noted other inventors did not seem to be pursuing.<ref name="ABC-CLIO">{{cite book|title=Icons of Invention: The Makers of the Modern World from Gutenberg to Gates|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WKuG-VIwID8C&pg=PA162|year=2009|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-34743-6|page=162}}</ref>

====Developing radio telegraphy====
[[File:Marconi's first radio transmitter.jpg|thumb|Marconi's first transmitter incorporating a [[monopole antenna]]. It consisted of an elevated copper sheet ''(top)'' connected to a Righi spark gap ''(left)'' powered by an [[induction coil]] ''(center)'' with a [[telegraph key]] ''(right)'' to switch it on and off to spell out text messages in [[Morse code]]. ]]

At the age of 20, Marconi began to conduct experiments in radio waves, building much of his own equipment in the attic of his home at the Villa Griffone in Pontecchio (now an administrative subdivision of [[Sasso Marconi]]), Italy, with the help of his butler, Mignani. Marconi built on Hertz's original experiments and, at the suggestion of Righi, began using a [[coherer]], an early detector based on the 1890 findings of French physicist [[Édouard Branly]] and used in Lodge's experiments, that [[Electrical resistance and conductance|changed resistance]] when exposed to radio waves.<ref name="Brown141">Brown, Antony. ''Great Ideas in Communications''. D. White Co., 1969, page 141</ref> In the summer of 1894, he built a storm alarm made up of a battery, a coherer, and an electric bell, which went off when it picked up the radio waves generated by lightning.

Late one night, in December 1894, Marconi demonstrated a radio transmitter and receiver to his mother, a set-up that made a bell ring on the other side of the room by pushing a telegraphic button on a bench.<ref>[http://www.radiomarconi.com/marconi/xmarconi.html ''Guglielmo Marconi, padre della radio'']. Radiomarconi.com. Retrieved on 12 July 2012.</ref><ref name="Brown141"/> Supported by his father, Marconi continued to read through the literature and picked up on the ideas of physicists who were experimenting with radio waves. He developed devices, such as portable transmitters and receiver systems, that could work over long distances,<ref name="ABC-CLIO"/> turning what was essentially a laboratory experiment into a useful communication system.<ref>[[#Hong|Hong]], p. 22</ref> Marconi came up with a functional system with many components:<ref>Marconi delineated his 1895 apparatus in his Nobel Award speech. See: Marconi, "[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1909/marconi-lecture.html Wireless Telegraphic Communication: Nobel Lecture, 11 December 1909.]" Nobel Lectures. Physics 1901–1921. Amsterdam: Elsevier Publishing Company, 1967: 196–222. p. 198.</ref>
* A relatively simple [[oscillator]] or [[spark-gap transmitter|spark-producing]] radio transmitter;
* A [[wire]] or metal sheet capacity area suspended at a height above the ground;
* A [[coherer]] receiver, which was a modification of [[Édouard Branly]]'s original device with refinements to increase sensitivity and reliability;
* A [[telegraph key]] to operate the transmitter to send short and long pulses, corresponding to the dots-and-dashes of [[Morse code]]; and
* A telegraph register activated by the [[coherer]] which recorded the received [[Morse code]] dots and dashes onto a roll of paper tape.

In the summer of 1895, Marconi moved his experiments outdoors on his father's estate in Bologna.  He tried different arrangements and shapes of antenna but even with improvements he was able to transmit signals only up to one half-mile, a distance Oliver Lodge had predicted in 1894 as the maximum transmission distance for radio waves.<ref>[[#Hong|Hong]], p. 6</ref>

====Transmission breakthrough====

A breakthrough came in the summer of 1895, when Marconi found that much greater range could be achieved after he raised the height of his antenna and, borrowing from a technique used in wired telegraphy, [[Ground (electricity)|grounded]] his transmitter and receiver. With these improvements, the system was capable of transmitting signals up to {{Convert|2|mi}} and over hills.<ref>[[#Hong|Hong]], pp. 20–22</ref><ref>Marconi, "[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1909/marconi-lecture.html Wireless Telegraphic Communication: Nobel Lecture, 11 December 1909.]" Nobel Lectures. Physics 1901–1921. Amsterdam: Elsevier Publishing Company, 1967: 196–222. p. 206.</ref> The [[monopole antenna]] reduced the frequency of the waves compared to the [[dipole antenna]]s used by Hertz, and radiated [[vertical polarization|vertically polarized]] radio waves which could travel longer distances. By this point, he concluded that a device could become capable of spanning greater distances, with additional funding and research, and would prove valuable both commercially and militarily. Marconi's experimental apparatus proved to be the first engineering-complete, commercially successful [[radio transmission]] system.<ref name="SaturdayThompson">The Saturday review of politics, literature, science and art, Volume 93.

Marconi wrote to the Ministry of Post and Telegraphs, then under the direction of [[Pietro Lacava]], explaining his wireless telegraph machine and asking for funding. He never received a response to his letter, which was eventually dismissed by the Minister, who wrote "to the Longara" on the document, referring to the insane asylum on Via della Lungara in Rome.<ref>Solari, Luigi (February 1948) "Guglielmo Marconi e la Marina Militare Italiana", ''Rivista Marittima''</ref>

In 1896, Marconi spoke with his family friend Carlo Gardini, Honorary Consul at the United States Consulate in Bologna, about leaving Italy to go to [[Great Britain]]. Gardini wrote a letter of introduction to the Ambassador of Italy in London, [[Annibale Ferrero]], explaining who Marconi was and about his extraordinary discoveries. In his response, Ambassador Ferrero advised them not to reveal Marconi's results until after a patent was obtained. He also encouraged Marconi to come to Britain, where he believed it would be easier to find the necessary funds to convert his experiments into practical use.
Finding little interest or appreciation for his work in Italy, Marconi travelled to [[London]] in early 1896 at the age of 21, accompanied by his mother, to seek support for his work. (He spoke fluent English in addition to Italian.) Marconi arrived at [[Dover]], and the Customs officer opened his case to find various apparatus. The customs officer immediately contacted [[Admiralty (United Kingdom)|the Admiralty]] in London. While there, Marconi gained the interest and support of [[William Preece]], the Chief Electrical Engineer of the [[General Post Office]] (the GPO). During this time Marconi decided he should patent his system, which he applied for on 2 June 1896, British Patent number 12039 titled "Improvements in Transmitting Electrical impulses and Signals, and in Apparatus therefor", which would become the first patent for a radio wave based communication system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.seas.columbia.edu/marconi/history.html|title=Marconi - Marconi History|website=www.seas.columbia.edu}}</ref>

Marconi made the first demonstration of his system for the British government in July 1896.<ref>{{cite web|title=Flickr Photo|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/psd/164193649/|date=9 June 2006}}</ref> A further series of demonstrations for the British followed, and, by March 1897, Marconi had transmitted Morse code signals over a distance of about {{convert|6|km|mi}} across [[Salisbury Plain]]. On 13 May 1897, Marconi sent the first ever wireless communication over open sea – a message was transmitted over the [[Bristol Channel]] from [[Flat Holm]] Island to [[Lavernock Point]] near [[Cardiff]], a distance of {{convert|6|km|mi}}.

[[File:Marconi in London.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.8|Plaque on the outside of the [[BT Centre]] commemorates Marconi's first public transmission of wireless signals.]]

Impressed by these and other demonstrations, Preece introduced Marconi's ongoing work to the general public at two important London lectures: "Telegraphy without Wires", at the [[Toynbee Hall]] on 11 December 1896; and "Signalling through Space without Wires", given to the [[Royal Institution]] on 4 June 1897.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=January 23, 1897|title=Telegraphy Without Wires|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/26120030|journal=[[Scientific American]]|volume=76|issue=4|pages=55–56|jstor=26120030|via=JSTOR}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|date=December 17, 1897|title=Signalling Through Space Without Wires|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1623911|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=6|issue=155|pages=889–896|doi=10.1126/science.6.155.889|jstor=1623911|pmid=17740846|bibcode=1897Sci.....6..889.|via=JSTOR|last1=Preece|first1=W. H.}}</ref>

Numerous additional demonstrations followed, and Marconi began to receive international attention. In July 1897, he carried out a series of tests at [[La Spezia]], in his home country, for the Italian government. A test for [[Lloyd's of London|Lloyd's]] between The Marine Hotel in [[Ballycastle, County Antrim|Ballycastle]] and [[Rathlin Island]], both in [[County Antrim]] in [[Ulster]], [[Ireland]], was conducted on 6 July 1898 by [[George Stephen Kemp|George Kemp]] and [[Edward Edwin Glanville]].<ref name="Mollan">{{cite book|last1=Mollan|first1=Charles|title=It's Part of What We Are: Volume 1|date=2007|publisher=Royal Dublin Society|isbn=9780860270553|location=Dublin|page=1407}}</ref> A transmission across the [[English channel]] was accomplished on 27 March 1899, from [[Wimereux]], France to [[South Foreland Lighthouse]], England. Marconi set up an experimental base at the [[Haven Hotel]], [[Sandbanks]], [[Poole Harbour]], [[Dorset]], where he erected a 100-foot high mast. He became friends with the van Raaltes, the owners of [[Brownsea Island]] in Poole Harbour, and his steam yacht, the ''[[Elettra (ship 1904)|Elettra]]'', was often moored on Brownsea or at The Haven Hotel. Marconi purchased the vessel after the Great War and converted it to a seaborne laboratory from where he conducted many of his experiments. Among the ''Elettra'''s crew was [[Adelmo Landini]], his personal radio operator, who was also an inventor.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Risi|first=Giacomo Bortolotti, Fabio|title=Adelmo Landini "Sasso Marconi Foto|url=https://www.sassomarconifoto.it/index.php/personaggi-del-sasso/adelmo-landini/|access-date=21 October 2020|language=it}}</ref>

In December 1898, the British lightship service authorised the establishment of wireless communication between the [[South Foreland]] lighthouse at [[Dover]] and the East Goodwin [[Lightvessel|lightship]], twelve miles distant. On 17 March 1899, the East Goodwin lightship sent the first [[SOS]] message, a signal on behalf of the merchant vessel ''Elbe'' which had run aground on [[Goodwin Sands]]. The message was received by the radio operator of the South Foreland lighthouse, who summoned the aid of the [[Ramsgate]] lifeboat.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015030656105;view=1up;seq=117 "Marconi's Wireless Telegraph] by Cleveland Moffett, ''McClure's Magazine'', June 1899, pages 99–112.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/connecting-britain/first-ever-radio-distress-call/|title=This week in tech|date=17 March 2017|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>

In the autumn of 1899, the first demonstrations in the [[United States]] took place. Marconi had sailed to the U.S. at the invitation of ''[[The New York Herald]]'' newspaper to cover the [[America's Cup]] international yacht races off [[Sandy Hook]], [[New Jersey]]. The transmission was done aboard the SS ''Ponce'', a passenger ship of the ''Porto Rico Line''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Helgesen|first=Henry N.|title=Wireless Goes to Sea: Marconi's Radio and SS Ponce|journal=Sea History|issue=Spring 2008|page=122}}</ref> Marconi left for [[England]] on 8 November 1899 on the [[American Line]]'s {{SS|Saint Paul}}, and he and his assistants installed wireless equipment aboard during the voyage.

At the turn of the 20th century, Marconi began investigating a means to signal across the Atlantic to compete with the [[transatlantic telegraph cable]]s. Marconi established a wireless transmitting station at Marconi House, [[Rosslare Strand]], [[County Wexford]], in 1901 to act as a link between [[Poldhu]] in [[Cornwall]], England, and [[Clifden]] in [[Connemara]], [[County Galway]], Ireland. He soon made the announcement that the message was received at [[Signal Hill (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Signal Hill]] in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] (now part of [[Canada]]), on 12 December 1901, using a {{convert|500|ft|m|adj=on}} kite-supported antenna for reception—signals transmitted by the company's new high-power station at [[Poldhu]], Cornwall. The distance between the two points was about {{convert|2200|mi|km}}. It was heralded as a great scientific advance, yet there also was—and continues to be—considerable scepticism about this claim. The exact wavelength used is not known, but it is fairly reliably determined to have been in the neighbourhood of 350 meters (frequency ≈ 850&nbsp;kHz). The tests took place at a time of day during which the entire transatlantic path was in daylight. It is now known (although Marconi did not know then) that this was the worst possible choice. At this medium wavelength, long-distance transmission in the daytime is not possible because of heavy absorption of the skywave in the ionosphere. It was not a blind test; Marconi knew in advance to listen for a repetitive signal of three clicks, signifying the Morse code letter ''S''. The clicks were reported to have been heard faintly and sporadically. There was no independent confirmation of the reported reception, and the transmissions were difficult to distinguish from atmospheric noise. A detailed technical review of Marconi's early transatlantic work appears in John S. Belrose's work of 1995. The Poldhu transmitter was a two-stage circuit.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/MAP.2004.1305565|year=2004|journal=IEEE Antennas and Propagation Magazine|volume=46|issue=2|page=130|title=Marconi and the History of Radio}}</ref><ref>Belrose, John S.

Feeling challenged by sceptics, Marconi prepared a better organised and documented test. In February 1902, the SS ''Philadelphia'' sailed west from Great Britain with Marconi aboard, carefully recording signals sent daily from the Poldhu station. The test results produced [[Magnetic detector|coherer-tape]] reception up to {{convert|1550|mi|km}}, and audio reception up to {{convert|2100|mi|km}}. The maximum distances were achieved at night, and these tests were the first to show that radio signals for [[medium wave]] and [[longwave]] transmissions travel much farther at night than in the day. During the daytime, signals had been received up to only about {{convert|700|mi|km}}, less than half of the distance claimed earlier at Newfoundland, where the transmissions had also taken place during the day. Because of this, Marconi had not fully confirmed the Newfoundland claims, although he did prove that radio signals could be sent for hundreds of kilometres (miles), despite some scientists' belief that they were limited essentially to line-of-sight distances.

On 17 December 1902, a transmission from the Marconi station in [[Glace Bay]], Nova Scotia, Canada, became the world's first radio message to cross the Atlantic from North America. In 1901, Marconi built a station near [[Wellfleet, Massachusetts|South Wellfleet, Massachusetts]], that sent a message of greetings on 18 January 1903 from United States President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to [[King Edward VII]] of the United Kingdom. However, consistent transatlantic signalling was difficult to establish.<ref>{{Cite web|title=TR Center - Talking Across the Ocean|url=https://www.theodorerooseveltcenter.org/Blog/Item/Talking%20Across%20the%20Ocean|access-date=2021-03-12|website=www.theodorerooseveltcenter.org}}</ref>

Marconi began to build high-powered stations on both sides of the Atlantic to communicate with ships at sea, in competition with other inventors. In 1904, he established a commercial service to transmit nightly news summaries to subscribing ships, which could incorporate them into their on-board newspapers. A regular transatlantic radio-telegraph service was finally begun on 17 October 1907<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Clifden Station of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph System|journal=Scientific American|date=23 November 1907}}</ref><ref>[http://marconi100.ca/clip/marconi-sydpost19071024.html Second Test of the Marconi Over-Ocean Wireless System Proved Entirely Successful] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019025942/http://marconi100.ca/clip/marconi-sydpost19071024.html |date=19 October 2013 }}.

====''Titanic''====
The role played by Marconi Co. wireless in maritime rescues raised public awareness of the value of radio and brought fame to Marconi, particularly the sinking of the [[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] on 15 April 1912 and the [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']] on 7 May 1915.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Who was Guglielmo Marconi?

[[RMS Titanic|RMS ''Titanic'']] radio operators [[Jack Phillips (wireless officer)|Jack Phillips]] and [[Harold Bride]] were not employed by the [[White Star Line]] but by the [[Marconi International Marine Communication Company]]. After the sinking of the ocean liner on 15 April 1912, survivors were rescued by the [[RMS Carpathia|RMS ''Carpathia'']] of the [[Cunard Line]].<ref name="ReferenceA">Eaton, John P. and Haas, Charles A.

====Continuing work====
Over the years, the Marconi companies gained a reputation for being technically conservative, in particular by continuing to use inefficient spark-transmitter technology, which could be used only for radio-telegraph operations, long after it was apparent that the future of radio communication lay with [[continuous-wave]] transmissions which were more efficient and could be used for audio transmissions. Somewhat belatedly, the company did begin significant work with continuous-wave equipment beginning in 1915, after the introduction of the oscillating vacuum tube (valve). The [[New Street Works]] factory in [[Chelmsford]] was the location for the first entertainment radio [[Broadcasting|broadcast]]s in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1920, employing a vacuum tube transmitter and featuring [[Dame Nellie Melba]]. In 1922, regular entertainment broadcasts commenced from the [[Marconi Research Centre]] at [[Great Baddow]], forming the prelude to the [[BBC]], and he spoke of the close association of aviation and wireless telephony in that same year at a private gathering with [[Florence Tyzack Parbury]], and even spoke of interplanetary wireless communication.

In 1914, Marconi was made a Senator in the [[Senate of the Kingdom of Italy]] and appointed Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the [[Royal Victorian Order]] in the UK. During [[World War I]], Italy joined the Allied side of the conflict, and Marconi was placed in charge of the Italian military's radio service. He attained the rank of lieutenant in the [[Italian Royal Army]] and of commander in the ''[[Regia Marina]]''. In 1929, he was made a [[marquess]] by [[King Victor Emmanuel III]].<ref name=":0" />

Marconi joined the [[Italian fascism|Italian Fascist]] party in 1923.

In 1943, Marconi's elegant sailing yacht, the ''[[Elettra (ship 1904)|Elettra]]'', was commandeered and refitted as a warship by the German Navy.  She was sunk by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] on 22 January 1944. After the war, the Italian Government tried to retrieve the wreckage, to rebuild the boat, and the wreckage was removed to Italy. Eventually, the idea was abandoned, and the wreckage was cut into pieces which were distributed amongst Italian museums.

In 1943, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] handed down a decision on Marconi's radio patents restoring some of the prior patents of [[Oliver Lodge]], [[John Stone Stone]], and [[Nikola Tesla]].<ref name="LQsxMxEUC page 3">{{cite book|author1=Redouté, Jean-Michel  |author2=Steyaert, Michiel |title=EMC of Analog Integrated Circuits|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c92LQsxMxEUC&pg=PA3|date=2009|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-90-481-3230-0|page=3}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Meadow, Charles T. |title=Making Connections: Communication through the Ages|url=https://archive.org/details/makingconnection00mead|url-access=registration |date= 2002|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-1-4617-0691-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/makingconnection00mead/page/193 193]}}</ref> The decision was not about Marconi's original radio patents<ref>{{cite web|url=https://earlyradiohistory.us/tesla.htm |title=Nikola Tesla: The Guy Who DIDN'T "Invent Radio|author=White, Thomas H.|date= 1 November 2012 |publisher=Earlyradiohistory.us }}</ref> and the court declared that their decision had no bearing on Marconi's claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, just that since Marconi's claim to certain patents was questionable, he could not claim infringement on those same patents.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sobot, Robert |title=Wireless Communication Electronics: Introduction to RF Circuits and Design Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SdGaiV6iup0C&pg=PA4|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-1116-1|page=4}}</ref> There are claims the high court was trying to nullify a World War I claim against the United States government by the Marconi Company via simply restoring the non-Marconi prior patent.<ref name="LQsxMxEUC page 3"/>

[[File:Alfred Norton Goldsmith & Guglielmo Marconi 1922.jpg|right|thumb|American electrical engineer [[Alfred Norton Goldsmith]] and Marconi on 26 June 1922.]]

Marconi was a friend of Charles van Raalte and his wife Florence, the owners of [[Brownsea Island]]; and of Margherita, their daughter, and in 1904 he met her [[Irish people|Irish]] friend, [[The Honourable|The Hon.]] Beatrice O'Brien (1882–1976), a daughter of [[Edward O'Brien, 14th Baron Inchiquin|The 14th Baron Inchiquin]].

In 1913, the Marconi family returned to Italy and became part of Rome society. Beatrice served as a lady-in-waiting to [[Elena of Montenegro|Queen Elena]]. At Marconi's request, his marriage to Beatrice was annulled on 27 April 1927, so he could remarry.<ref>Marconi, Degna (2001) ''My Father, Marconi''. Guernica Editions.

On June 12, 1927, Marconi went on to marry [[Maria Cristina Bezzi-Scali]] (2 April 1900 – 15 July 1994), the only daughter of Francesco, [[Count]] Bezzi-Scali. To do this he had to be confirmed in the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] faith and became a devout member of the Church.<ref>Marconi, Maria Cristina (2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=wfSABTyeiV4C&pg=PA19&dq=marconi+catholic&hl=en&sa=X&ei=StMVVfzhMYOXNp_agPgI&ved=0CDIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=marconi%20catholic&f=false ''Marconi My Beloved''].

On 12 June 1927, Marconi married Maria Cristina in a civil service, with a religious ceremony performed on 15 June.  Marconi was 53 years old and Maria Cristina was 26.  They had one daughter, Maria Elettra Elena Anna (born 1930), who married [[Prince]] Carlo Giovannelli (1942–2016) in 1966; they later divorced. For unexplained reasons, Marconi left his entire fortune to his second wife and their only child, and nothing to the children of his first marriage.<ref>Degna Marconi (2001), ''My Father, Marconi'' (Guernica Editions), [https://books.google.com/books?id=NMmStBPCncIC&pg=PA232 p. 232]. {{ISBN|1550711512}}.</ref>

In his lecture he stated: "I reclaim the honour of being the first fascist in the field of radiotelegraphy, the first who acknowledged the utility of joining the electric rays in a bundle, as Mussolini was the first in the political field who acknowledged the necessity of merging all the healthy energies of the country into a bundle, for the greater greatness of Italy".<ref>Franco Monteleone, La radio italiana nel periodo fascista: studio e documenti, 1922–1945, Marsilio Editore, 1976, p. 44.</ref>

Marconi wanted to personally introduce in 1931 the first radio broadcast of a Pope, [[Pope Pius XI|Pius XI]], and did announce at the microphone: "With the help of God, who places so many mysterious forces of nature at man's disposal, I have been able to prepare this instrument which will give to the faithful of the entire world the joy of listening to the voice of the Holy Father".<ref>{{cite web|title=80 Years of Vatican Radio, Pope Pius XI and Marconi. .. and Father Jozef Murgas?|publisher=Saint Benedict Center|url=http://catholicism.org/80-years-of-vatican-radio-pope-pius-xi-and-marconi-and-father-jozef-murgas.html|date=18 February 2011}}</ref>
