Saramago was a founding member of the National Front for the Defense of Culture in Lisbon in 1992, and co-founder with [[Orhan Pamuk]], of the European Writers' Parliament (EWP).

==Biography==
===Early and middle life===
Saramago was born in 1922 into a family of very poor landless peasants in [[Azinhaga]], Portugal, a small village in [[Ribatejo Province]], some one hundred kilometers northeast of [[Lisbon]].<ref name=unexpected_fantasist/> His parents were José de Sousa and Maria de Piedade. "Saramago", the Portuguese word for ''[[Raphanus raphanistrum]]'' (wild radish), was his father's family's nickname, and was accidentally incorporated into his name upon registration of his birth.<ref name=unexpected_fantasist/>

In 1924, Saramago's family moved to Lisbon, where his father started working as a policeman. A few months after the family moved to the capital, his brother Francisco, older by two years, died. He spent vacations with his grandparents in Azinhaga. When his grandfather suffered a stroke and was to be taken to Lisbon for treatment, Saramago recalled, "He went into the yard of his house, where there were a few trees, fig trees, olive trees. And he went one by one, embracing the trees and crying, saying good-bye to them because he knew he would not return. To see this, to live this, if that doesn't mark you for the rest of your life," Saramago said, "you have no feeling."<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1998/lecture-e.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215031334/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1998/lecture-e.html|date=December 15, 2010}}</ref> Although Saramago was a good pupil, his parents were unable to afford to keep him in grammar school, and instead moved him to a technical school at age 12.

After graduating as a [[Lathe|lathe operator]], he worked as a car mechanic for two years. At this time Saramago had acquired a taste for reading and started to frequent a public library in Lisbon in his free time. He married [[w:pt:Ilda Reis|Ilda Reis]], a typist and later artist, in 1944 (they divorced in 1970). Their only daughter, Violante, was born in 1947.<ref name=unexpected_fantasist/> By this time he was working in the Social Welfare Service as a civil servant. Later he worked at the publishing company ''Estúdios Cor'' as an editor and translator, and then as a journalist. By that time, in 1968, he met and became lover of writer [[Isabel da Nóbrega]], the longtime partner of author and critic [[w:pt:João Gaspar Simões|João Gaspar Simões]]. Nóbrega became Saramago's devoted literary mentor, to whom he would later dedicate ''Memorial do Convento'' and ''O Ano da Morte de Ricardo Reis''.

After the [[Carnation Revolution|democratic revolution in 1974]], on April 9, 1975, during the rule of [[Vasco Gonçalves]], Saramago became the assistant director of newspaper ''[[Diário de Notícias]]'', and the editorial line became clearly pro-communist. A group of 30 journalists - half the editorial staff - handed the board a petition calling for the editorial line to be revised and for it to be published. A plenary was called and, following an angered intervention by Saramago, 24 journalists were expelled, accused of being right-wingers. After the [[Coup of 25 November 1975]] that put an end to the communist [[Processo Revolucionário Em Curso|PREC]], Saramago, on his turn, was fired from the newspaper.<ref>{{cite news |first=Carla|last=Aguiar |url=https://www.dn.pt/portugal/o--director--que-marcou-o-verao-quente-de-1975-1597476.html |title=O director que marcou o 'verão quente' de 1975 |location=Lisboa |newspaper=Diário de Notícias |date=19 June 2010 |access-date=26 September 2021}}</ref>

Saramago published his first novel, ''[[Land of Sin]]'', in 1947. It remained his only published literary work until a poetry book, ''Possible Poems'', was published in 1966. It was followed by another book of poems, ''Probably Joy'', in 1970, three collections of newspaper articles in 1971, 1973 and 1974 respectively, and the long poem ''The Year of 1993'' in 1975. A collection of political writing was published in 1976 under the title ''Notes''. After his dismissal from ''Diário de Notícias'' in 1975, Saramago embraced his writing more seriously and the following years he published a series of important works like ''Manual de Pintura e Caligrafia'' (1977), ''Objecto Quase'' (1978), ''Levantado do Chão'' (1980) and ''Viagem a Portugal'' (1981).

===Later life and international acclaim===
Saramago did not achieve widespread recognition and acclaim until he was sixty, with the publication of his fourth novel, ''Memorial do Convento'' (1982). A [[baroque]] tale set during the Inquisition in 18th-century Lisbon, it tells of the love between a maimed soldier and a young clairvoyant, and of a renegade priest's heretical dream of flight. The novel's translation in 1988 as ''[[Baltasar and Blimunda]]'' (by [[Giovanni Pontiero]]) brought Saramago to the attention of an international readership.<ref name=unexpected_fantasist/><ref name=new_ways_of_seeing>{{cite news |first=Maya |last=Jaggi |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/nov/22/jose-saramago-blindness-nobel |title=New ways of seeing |location=London |newspaper=The Guardian |date=22 November 2008 |access-date=22 November 2008}}</ref> This novel won the Portuguese PEN Club Award.

Followed by acclaimed novels such as ''[[The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis]]'' and ''[[The History of the Siege of Lisbon]]'', Saramago was hailed by literary critics for his complex yet elegant style, his broad range of references and his wit.<ref>[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/jose-saramago/the-history-of-the-siege-of-lisbon/ The History of the Siege of Lisbon by José Saramago] Kirkus Reviews 1 May 1997</ref>

For the former novel Saramago received the British [[Independent Foreign Fiction Prize]]. The multilayered ''The History of the Siege of Lisbon'' deals with the uncertainty of historical events and includes the story of a middle-aged isolated proofreader who falls in love with his boss. Saramago acknowledged that there is a lot of himself in the protagonist of the novel, and dedicated the novel to his wife.<ref>[https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/1032/the-art-of-fiction-no-155-jose-saramago José Saramago, The Art of Fiction No. 155] Paris Review 1998</ref>

In 1986 Saramago met an attractive Spanish journalist [[Pilar del Río]], 27 years his junior, and he promptly abandoned an astonished Isabel Nóbrega, his partner since 1968.<ref>{{cite news |first=Joana Emídio |last=Marques |url=https://observador.pt/especiais/isabel-da-nobrega-do-musa-saramago-apagou-da-historia/ |title=Isabel da Nóbrega, a musa que Saramago apagou da (sua) história |location=Lisboa |newspaper=Observador |date=30 May 2015 |access-date=26 September 2021}}</ref> They married in 1988 and remained together until his death in June 2010. Del Río is the official translator of Saramago's books into Spanish.

Saramago joined the [[Portuguese Communist Party]] in 1969 and remained a member until the end of his life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1998/bio-bibl.html |title=Nobel Prize citation, 1998 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |access-date=2010-06-20}}</ref> He was a self-confessed [[Pessimism|pessimist]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Adam |last=Langer |url=http://www.bookmagazine.com/issue25/saramago.shtml |title=José Saramago: Prophet of Doom – Pessimism is our only hope.

Portugal's conservative government, led by then-prime minister [[Aníbal Cavaco Silva]], did not allow Saramago's work to compete for the [[Aristeion Prize]],<ref name=unexpected_fantasist/> arguing that it offended the Catholic community. As a result, Saramago and his wife moved to [[Lanzarote]], an island in the Canaries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1998/saramago-autobio.html |title=José Saramago: Autobiography |year=1998 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |access-date=2010-06-20}}</ref>

In 1998 Saramago was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] with the prize motivation: "who with parables sustained by imagination, compassion and irony continually enables us once again to apprehend an elusory reality."<ref name="nobel">[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1998/saramago/biographical/ José Saramago Biography] Nobel Prize.org</ref>

The European Writers' Parliament (EWP) came about as a result of a joint proposal by Saramago and fellow Nobel laureate [[Orhan Pamuk]]. Saramago was expected to speak as the guest of honour at the EWP, but he died before the opening ceremony in 2010.<ref>{{cite news |first=William |last=Wall |author-link=William Wall (writer) |url=http://www.irishleftreview.org/2010/12/01/complexity-istanbul-declaration-european-writers-conference/ |title=The Complexity of Others: The Istanbul Declaration of The European Writers' Conference |newspaper=Irish Left Review |date=1 December 2010 |access-date=1 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802041041/http://www.irishleftreview.org/2010/12/01/complexity-istanbul-declaration-european-writers-conference/ |archive-date=2 August 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Death and funeral===

Saramago's English language translator, [[Margaret Jull Costa]], paid tribute to him, describing his "wonderful imagination" and calling him "the greatest contemporary Portuguese writer".<ref name=lea_dies/> Saramago had continued his writing until his death. His most recent publication, ''Claraboia'', was published in 2011, after his death. Saramago had suffered from [[pneumonia]] a year before his death. Having been thought to have made a full recovery, he had been scheduled to attend the [[Edinburgh International Book Festival]] in August 2010.<ref name=lea_dies/>

Saramago's funeral was held in Lisbon on 20 June 2010, in the presence of more than 20,000 people, many of whom had travelled hundreds of kilometres, but also notably in the absence of right-wing [[President of Portugal]] [[Aníbal Cavaco Silva]], who was holidaying in the [[Azores]] as the ceremony took place.<ref name=xinhua_funeral>{{cite news |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/culture/2010-06/21/c_13359797.htm |title=Portuguese Nobel laureate Saramago's funeral held |work=[[Xinhua News Agency]] |date=21 June 2010 |access-date=21 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100623123203/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/culture/2010-06/21/c_13359797.htm |archive-date=23 June 2010}}</ref> Cavaco Silva, the Prime Minister who removed Saramago's work from the shortlist of the [[Aristeion Prize]], said he did not attend Saramago's funeral because he "had never had the privilege to know him".<ref name=president_no-show>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment_and_arts/10364807.stm |title=President defends Jose Saramago funeral no-show |work=[[BBC News]] |date=21 June 2010 |access-date=21 June 2010}}</ref> Mourners, who questioned Cavaco Silva's absence in the presence of reporters,<ref name=president_no-show/> held copies of the red carnation, symbolic of [[Carnation Revolution|Portugal's democratic revolution]].<ref name=xinhua_funeral/> Saramago's cremation took place in Lisbon,<ref name=xinhua_funeral/> and his ashes were buried on the anniversary of his death, 18 June 2011, underneath a hundred year old olive tree on the square in front of the José Saramago Foundation (Casa dos Bicos).<ref>Cinzas de Saramago são depositadas aos pés de uma oliveira, em Lisboa UOL (18 de junho de 2011).</ref>

==Lost novel==
The [[José Saramago Foundation]] announced in October 2011 the publication of a so-called "lost novel" published as ''Skylight'' (''Claraboia'' in Portuguese). It was written in the 1950s and remained in the archive of a publisher to whom the manuscript had been sent. Saramago remained silent about the work up to his death. The book has been translated into several languages.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/cultura/Claraboya/novela/inedita/Saramago/vera/luz/elpepucul/20111003elpepucul_4/Tes |title=Claraboya, novela inédita de Saramago, verá la luz |newspaper=El País |date=3 October 2011 |access-date=14 October 2011}}</ref>

==Style and themes==
[[File:Saramago dos.jpg|thumb|Saramago at Teatro Jorge Eliécer Gaitán in [[Bogotá]] in 2007]]
Saramago's experimental style often features long sentences, at times more than a page long. He used periods sparingly, choosing instead a loose flow of clauses joined by commas.<ref name=unexpected_fantasist/> Many of his paragraphs extend for pages without pausing for dialogue, (which Saramago chooses not to delimit by quotation marks); when the speaker changes, Saramago capitalizes the first letter of the new speaker's clause. His works often refer to his other works.<ref name=unexpected_fantasist/> In his novel ''Blindness'', Saramago completely abandons the use of proper nouns, instead referring to characters simply by some unique characteristic, an example of his style reflecting the recurring themes of identity and meaning found throughout his work.

Saramago's novels often deal with fantastic scenarios. In his 1986 novel ''[[The Stone Raft]]'', the [[Iberian Peninsula]] breaks off from the rest of Europe and sails around the Atlantic Ocean. In his 1995 novel ''[[Blindness (novel)|Blindness]]'', an entire unnamed country is stricken with a mysterious plague of "white blindness". In his 1984 novel ''[[The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis]]'' (which won the PEN Award and the ''Independent'' Foreign Fiction Award), [[Fernando Pessoa]]'s [[Heteronym (literature)|heteronym]] survives for a year after the poet himself dies. Additionally, his novel ''[[Death with Interruptions]]'' (also translated as ''Death at Intervals'') takes place in a country in which, suddenly, nobody dies, and concerns, in part, the spiritual and political implications of the event, although the book ultimately moves from a synoptic to a more personal perspective.

Saramago addresses serious matters with empathy for the [[human condition]] and for the isolation of contemporary urban life. His characters struggle with their need to connect with one another, form relations and bond as a community, and also with their need for individuality, and to find meaning and dignity outside of political and economic structures.

When asked to describe his daily writing routine in 2009, Saramago responded, "I write two pages. And then I read and read and read."<ref>{{cite news |author=Maloney, Evan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/mar/02/best-advice-writers-read?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 |title=The best advice for writers?

==Personal life==
[[File:Saramago by bottelho.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Saramago by Portuguese painter Carlos Botelho]]
Saramago was an [[Atheism|atheist]]. The [[Catholic Church]] criticised him on numerous occasions due to the content of some of his novels, mainly ''[[The Gospel According to Jesus Christ]]'' and ''[[Cain (novel)|Cain]]'', in which he uses [[satire]] and biblical quotations to present the figure of God in a comical way. The Portuguese government lambasted his 1991 novel ''O Evangelho Segundo Jesus Cristo'' (''The Gospel according to Jesus Christ'') and struck the writer's name from nominees for the European Literature Prize, saying the atheist work offended Portuguese Catholic convictions.

The book portrays a Christ who, subject to human desires, lives with Mary Magdalene and tries to back out of the crucifixion.<ref>{{cite news |first=Elizabeth |last=Nash |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/saramago-the-atheist-an-outsider-in-his-own-land-1177040.html |title=Saramago the atheist, an outsider in his own land |location=London |newspaper=The Independent |date=9 October 1998}}</ref> Following the [[Swedish Academy]]'s decision to present Saramago with the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], the Vatican questioned the decision on political grounds, though gave no comment on the aesthetic or literary components of Saramago's work. Saramago responded: "The Vatican is easily scandalized, especially by people from outside. They should just focus on their prayers and leave people in peace. I respect those who believe, but I have no respect for the institution."<ref name=nyt_defends_work>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/12/world/nobel-writer-a-communist-defends-work.html |title=Nobel Writer, A Communist, Defends Work |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=12 October 1998 |access-date=18 June 2010}}</ref>

Saramago was a proponent of [[Anarchist communism|anarcho-communism]],<ref name=china_post_portugal_mourns/>{{failed verification|date=October 2018}} and a member of the [[Communist Party of Portugal]],<ref name=ap_dies/> however, in his: 'Lanzarote Notebook 1', José Saramago cites a comment by [[Gabriel García Márquez]], during a meeting in [[Santiago de Compostela]], called by [[Manuel Fraga]]: 'You the Stalinist don't believe in reality'. As such 'communist' he stood for the 1989 Lisbon local election in the list of the Coalition "For Lisbon" and was elected [[alderman]] and presiding officer of the [[Assembleia Municipal|Municipal Assembly]] of Lisbon.<ref name=pcp.pt>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcp.pt/node/244347 |title=Communist Party of Portugal: Short Biographical note on José Saramago |publisher=Pcp.pt |access-date=2012-06-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307161912/http://www.pcp.pt/node/244347 |archive-date=2012-03-07}}</ref> Saramago was also a candidate of the [[Democratic Unity Coalition]] in all elections to the [[European Parliament]] from 1989 to 2009, though was often in positions thought to have no possibility of being elected.<ref name=pcp.pt/> He was a critic of [[European Union]] (EU) and [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) policies.<ref name=unexpected_fantasist/>

Although many of his novels are acknowledged political satire of a subtle kind, it is in ''The Notebook'' that Saramago made his political convictions most clear. The book, written from a Marxist perspective, is a collection of his blog articles for the year September 2008 to August 2009. According to ''[[The Independent]]'', "Saramago aims to cut through the web of 'organized lies' surrounding humanity, and to convince readers by delivering his opinions in a relentless series of unadorned, knock-down prose blows."<ref>{{cite news |first=Thomas |last=Wright |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-notebook-by-jos-saramago-1932464.html |title=The Notebook by José Saramago: The Nobel laureate's blog entries burn with passion |newspaper=The Independent |date=4 April 2010 |access-date=4 April 2010}}</ref> His political engagement led to comparisons with [[George Orwell]]: "Orwell's hostility to the British Empire runs parallel to Saramago's latter-day crusade against empire in the shape of globalisation."<ref>{{cite web |first=Christopher |last=Rollason |url=http://yatrarollason.info/files/SaramagoandOrwell.pdf |title=How totalitarianism begins at home: Saramago and Orwell |year=2006}}</ref>

When speaking to ''The Observer'' in 2006 he said "The painter paints, the musician makes music, the novelist writes novels. But I believe that we all have some influence, not because of the fact that one is an artist, but because we are citizens. As citizens, we all have an obligation to intervene and become involved, it's the citizen who changes things. I can't imagine myself outside any kind of social or political involvement."<ref>{{cite news |first=Stephanie |last=Meritt |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/apr/30/fiction.features1 |title=Interview: Still a street-fighting man |newspaper=The Observer |date=30 April 2006 |access-date=30 April 2006}}</ref>

During the [[Second Intifada]], while visiting [[Ramallah]] in March 2002, Saramago said: "What is happening in Palestine is a crime we can put on the same plain as what happened at [[Auschwitz]] ... A sense of impunity characterises the Israeli people and its army. They have turned into rentiers of the Holocaust."<ref name=militant_magician/> Some critics of these words contended that they were [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]].<ref name=ap_dies>[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100618/ap_on_en_ot/eu_obit_saramago "Nobel-winning Portuguese novelist Saramago dies"], Associated Press 18-06-2010</ref><ref>[http://www.adl.org/presrele/asint_13/4370_13.htm De las piedras de David a los tanques de Goliat] by José Saramago, ''El País'' 21/Abril/2002 (in Spanish).</ref><ref>[http://www.travelbrochuregraphics.com/extra/bigotry_in_print.htm "Bigotry in Print.

"To have said that Israel's action is to be condemned, that war crimes are being perpetrated – really the Israelis are used to that. It doesn't bother them. But there are certain words they can't stand. And to say 'Auschwitz' there ... note well, I didn't say that Ramallah was the same as Auschwitz, that would be stupid. What I said was that the spirit of Auschwitz was present in Ramallah. We were eight writers. They all made condemning statements, [[Wole Soyinka]], [[Breyten Breytenbach]], [[Vincenzo Consolo]] and others. But the Israelis weren't bothered about those. It was the fact that I put my finger in the Auschwitz wound that made them jump."<ref name=militant_magician>{{cite news |first=Julian |last=Evans |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/dec/28/featuresreviews.guardianreview11?INTCMP=SRCH |title=The militant magician |newspaper=The Guardian |date=28 December 2002 |access-date=28 December 2002}}</ref>

During the [[2006 Lebanon War]], Saramago joined [[Tariq Ali]], [[John Berger]], [[Noam Chomsky]], and others in condemning what they characterized as "a long-term military, economic and geographic practice whose political aim is nothing less than the liquidation of the Palestinian nation".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chomsky.info/letters/20060719.htm |title=Israel, Lebanon, and Palestine: Tariq Ali, John Berger, Noam Chomsky, Eduardo Galeano, Naomi Klein, Harold Pinter, Arundhati Roy, José Saramago & Howard Zinn |date=19 July 2006}}</ref>

He was also a supporter of [[Iberian Federalism]]. In a 2008 press conference for the filming of ''Blindness'' he asked, in reference to the [[Great Recession]], "Where was all that money poured on markets? Very tight and well kept; then suddenly it appears to save what? lives? no, banks." He added, "Marx was never so right as now", and predicted "the worst is still to come."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://en.mercopress.com/2008/10/28/karl-marx-was-never-so-right-says-nobel-laureate-saramago |title=Karl Marx was never so right, says Nobel laureate Saramago |work=MercoPress (Quote here is based on the source heading; there appears to be a typing error in the source text.) |date=28 October 2008 |access-date=28 October 2008}}</ref>
