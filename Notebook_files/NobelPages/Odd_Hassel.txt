'''Odd Hassel''' (17 May 1897 &ndash; 11 May <!--sometimes given as 1991-->1981) was a Norwegian [[physical chemistry|physical chemist]] and [[Nobel Laureate]].<ref name=bio>{{cite web|url =https://nbl.snl.no/Odd_Hassel   |title=   Odd Hassel|publisher=  Norsk biografisk leksikon

==Biography==
Hassel was born in [[Oslo|Kristiania]] (now Oslo), Norway. His parents were Ernst Hassel (1848–1905), a [[gynaecology|gynaecologist]], and Mathilde Klaveness (1860–1955). In 1915, he entered the [[University of Oslo]] where he studied [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], and graduated in 1920. [[Victor Goldschmidt]] was Hassel's tutor when he began studies in Oslo, while [[Heinrich Jacob Goldschmidt]], Victor's father, was Hassel's thesis advisor. Father and son were important figures in Hassel's life and they remained friends.<ref>{{Citation|last=Pedersen|first=Bjørn|title=Odd Hassel|date=2019-09-24|url=http://snl.no/Odd_Hassel|work=Store norske leksikon|language=no|access-date=2019-10-23}}</ref><ref>Kramish, Arnold (1986). ''The Griffin: The Greatest Untold Espionage Story of World War II.'' Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company. {{ISBN|0-395-36318-7}}.</ref> After taking a year off from studying, he went to [[Munich]], Germany to work in the laboratory of Professor [[Kasimir Fajans]].<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BJbJw2TQVqwC&pg=PA65 Candid Science III: More Conversations with Famous Chemists]'', Istvan Hargittai, Magdolna Hargittai, Imperial College Press, 2003.</ref>

His work there led to the detection of [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorption]] indicators. After moving to [[Berlin]], he worked at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]], where he began to do research on [[X-ray crystallography]].<ref>[http://www.bookrags.com/biography/odd-hassel-wsd/ Odd Hassel biography] bookrags.com</ref> He furthered his research with a [[Rockefeller Fellowship]], obtained with the help of [[Fritz Haber]]. In 1924, he obtained his PhD from [[Humboldt University of Berlin]], before moving to his alma mater, the University of Oslo, where he worked from 1925 through 1964. He became a professor in 1934.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1969/hassel-bio.html Odd Hassel - The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1969], nobelprize.org</ref>

His work was interrupted in October, 1943 when he and other university staff members were arrested by the [[Nasjonal Samling]] and handed over to the [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany|occupation authorities]]. He spent time in several detention camps, until he was released in November, 1944.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Ottosen, Kristian|editor-link=Kristian Ottosen|title=Nordmenn i fangenskap 1940–1945|edition=2nd|year=2004|publisher=Universitetsforlaget|location=Oslo|language=no|isbn=978-82-15-00288-0|page=289}}</ref>

==Work==

Hassel originally focused on [[inorganic chemistry]], but beginning in 1930 his work concentrated on problems connected with [[molecular structure]], particularly the structure of [[cyclohexane]] and its derivatives. He introduced the Norwegian scientific community to the concepts of the [[electric dipole moment]]s and [[electron diffraction]]. The work for which he is best known established the three-dimensionality of [[molecular geometry]]. He focused his research on ring-shaped [[carbon]] [[molecules]], which he suspected filled three dimensions instead of two, the common belief of the time. By using the number of [[Chemical bond|bonds]] between the carbon and hydrogen atoms, Hassel demonstrated the impossibility of the molecules existing on only one plane. This discovery led to him being awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for 1969.

==Honors==
Hassel was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1969.

He received the [[Cato Maximilian Guldberg|Guldberg]]-[[Peter Waage|Waage]] Medal (''Guldberg-Waage Medal'') from the [[Norwegian Chemical Society]] and the [[Gunnerus Medal]] from the [[Royal Norwegian Society of Science and Letters]], both in 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.kjemi.no/selskapet/?dok=guldberg_og_waage |title= Professor Odd Hassel, 11. mars 1964   |publisher=  Guldberg og Waage-medaljen|access-date= February 1, 2018}}</ref>

Hassel held honorary degrees from the [[University of Copenhagen]] (1950) and [[University of Stockholm]] (1960). An annual lecture named in his honor is given at the [[University of Oslo]].<ref>{{cite web|url =   https://snl.no/Odd_Hassel|title=   Odd Hassel|publisher= Store norske leksikon|author= Bjørn Pedersen|access-date= February 1, 2018}}</ref>

He was an honorary Fellow of the [[Norwegian Chemical Society]],  [[Chemical Society of London]], [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]], [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]] and [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=   Odd Hassel|journal = Journal of Chemical Education|volume = 29|pages = 25|author=  Ralph E. Oesper|date=  January 1952|issue = 1|doi=   10.1021/ed029p25|bibcode = 1952JChEd..29...25O}}</ref>

He was made a Knight of the [[Order of St. Olav]] in 1960.<ref name="bio"/>
