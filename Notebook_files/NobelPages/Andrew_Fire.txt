'''Andrew Zachary Fire''' (born April 27, 1959) is an American [[biologist]] and professor of pathology and of genetics at the [[Stanford University]] School of Medicine. He was awarded the 2006 [[Nobel Prize]] for [[Physiology]] or [[Medicine]], along with [[Craig C. Mello]], for the discovery of [[RNA interference]] (RNAi). This research was conducted at the [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institution of Washington]] and published in 1998.

Fire moved to [[Cambridge]], [[England]], as a [[Helen Hay Whitney Foundation|Helen Hay Whitney Postdoctoral Fellow]]. He became a member of the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|MRC]] [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]] group headed by Nobel laureate biologist [[Sydney Brenner]].

From 1986 to 2003, Fire was a staff member of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]]’s Department of [[Embryology]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. The initial work on double stranded RNA as a trigger of gene silencing was published while Fire and his group were at the Carnegie Labs.<ref name="Stanford School of Medicine" /> Fire became an adjunct professor in the Department of Biology at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1989 and joined the Stanford faculty in 2003. Throughout his career, Fire has been supported by research grants from the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]].

Fire is a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. He also serves on the Board of Scientific Counselors and the National Center for Biotechnology, National Institutes of Health.

In 2006, Fire and Craig Mello shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for work first published in 1998 in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.<ref name=AF1998>{{cite journal

As a result, the mRNA cannot be translated into protein. Fire and Mello found that dsRNA was much more effective in gene silencing than the previously described method of RNA interference with single-stranded RNA. Because only small numbers of dsRNA molecules were required for the observed effect, Fire and Mello proposed that a catalytic process was involved. This hypothesis was confirmed by subsequent research.

The Nobel Prize citation, issued by Sweden's [[Karolinska Institute]], said: "This year's Nobel Laureates have discovered a fundamental mechanism for controlling the flow of genetic information." The [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC) quoted Nick Hastie, director of the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]]'s Human Genetics Unit, on the scope and implications of the research:
