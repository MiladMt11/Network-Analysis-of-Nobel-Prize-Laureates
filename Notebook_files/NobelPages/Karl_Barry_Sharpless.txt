'''Karl Barry Sharpless''' (born April 28, 1941) is an American [[chemist]] and [[List of Nobel laureates in Chemistry|Nobel Laureate]] known for his work on [[stereoselective reactions]] and [[click chemistry]].

== Early life and education ==
Sharpless was born April 28, 1941, in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. He graduated from [[Friends' Central School]] in 1959,<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://cen.acs.org/people/awards/2019-Priestley-Medalist-K-Barry-Sharpless-works-magic-in-the-world-of-molecules/97/i13|title=2019 Priestley Medalist K. Barry Sharpless works magic in the world of molecules|website=Chemical & Engineering News|language=en|access-date=April 8, 2019}}</ref> and continued his studies at [[Dartmouth College]], earning an A.B. in 1963 and a Ph.D. in chemistry from [[Stanford University]] in 1968.<ref name="thesis-sharpless-1968">{{cite thesis|url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/302369766/|title=Studies of the mechanism of action of 2,3-oxidosqualene-lanosterol cyclase: featuring enzymic cyclization of modified squalene oxides|date=1968|publisher=[[Stanford University]]|type=Ph.D.|last=Sharpless|first=Karl Barry|via=[[ProQuest]]|url-access=subscription |oclc=66229398}}</ref>  He continued post-doctoral work at Stanford University (1968–1969) and [[Harvard University]] (1969–1970).

== Academic career ==
Sharpless was a professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (1970–1977, 1980–1990) and [[Stanford University]] (1977–1980).<ref name="amws">{{Cite book|title=American Men & Women of Science|url=https://archive.org/details/americanmenwomen02hend|url-access=registration|last=Henderson|first=Andrea Kovacs|publisher=Gale.

M. Keck]] professorship in chemistry at [[The Scripps Research Institute]] since 1990.

== Research ==
Sharpless developed stereoselective oxidation reactions, and showed that the formation of an inhibitor with femtomolar potency can be catalyzed by the enzyme [[acetylcholinesterase]], beginning with an azide and an alkyne. He discovered several chemical reactions which have transformed asymmetric synthesis from science fiction to the relatively routine, including aminohydroxylation, dihydroxylation, and the Sharpless asymmetric epoxidation.<ref name="nndb">{{Cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/854/000100554/ |title=K. Barry Sharpless |date=2014 |access-date=July 12, 2014 |website=Notable Names Database |publisher=Soylent Communications }}</ref>

In 2001 he won a half-share of the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his work on chirally catalysed [[oxidation]] reactions ([[Sharpless epoxidation]], [[Sharpless asymmetric dihydroxylation]], [[Sharpless oxyamination]]). The other half of the year's Prize was shared between [[William S. Knowles]] and [[Ryōji Noyori]] (for their work on stereoselective [[hydrogenation]]).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2001/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2001 |date=2001 |access-date=July 12, 2014 |website=Nobelprize.org |publisher=The Nobel Foundation }}</ref>

His group has also successfully epoxidized (using racemic [[tartaric acid]]) a C-86 Buckminster [[Fullerene]] ball, employing [[p-Cresol]] as solvent.

The term "[[click chemistry]]" was coined by Sharpless in 1998, and was first fully described by Sharpless, Hartmuth Kolb, and M.G. Finn at [[Scripps Research Institute|The Scripps Research Institute]] in 2001.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kolb|first=Hartmuth C.|last2=Finn|first2=M. G.|last3=Sharpless|first3=K.

ScienceWatch. Retrieved on June 16, 2014.</ref> This involves a set of highly selective, exothermic reactions which occur under mild conditions; the most successful example is the [[azide alkyne Huisgen cycloaddition]] to form [[1,2,3-Triazole|1,2,3-triazoles]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Richard A.|date=2007|title=The Rise of Azide–Alkyne 1,3-Dipolar 'Click' Cycloaddition and its Application to Polymer Science and Surface Modification|journal=Australian Journal of Chemistry|language=en|volume=60|issue=6|pages=384|doi=10.1071/CH06457|issn=0004-9425}}</ref>

{{As of|2021}}, Sharpless has an [[h-index]] of 180 according to [[Google Scholar]]<ref>{{Google Scholar id}}</ref> and of 122 according to [[Scopus]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scopus.com/authid/detail.uri?authorId=7006064369|title=Scopus preview – Sharpless, K.

== Awards and honors ==
Sharpless was a recipient of the 2001 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his work on "chirally catalysed oxidation reactions".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2001/summary/|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2001|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=April 5, 2019}}</ref>

In 2019, Sharpless was awarded the [[Priestley Medal|Priestley medal]], the [[American Chemical Society|American Chemical Society's]] highest honor, for “the invention of catalytic, asymmetric oxidation methods, the concept of click chemistry and development of the copper-catalyzed version of the azide-acetylene cycloaddition reaction.”.<ref name="auto"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cen.acs.org/people/awards/K-Barry-Sharpless-named-2019/96/i26|title=K.

He holds honorary degrees from the [[KTH Royal Institute of Technology]] (1995), [[Technical University of Munich]] (1995), [[Université catholique de Louvain|Catholic University of Louvain]] (1996) and [[Wesleyan University]] (1999).<ref name="amws" />

== Personal life ==
Sharpless married Jan Dueser in 1965 and they have three children.<ref name="nndb" /> He was blinded in one eye during a lab accident in 1970, shortly after he arrived at MIT as an assistant professor.<ref>[http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1992/safety-0311.html A cautionary tale from the past | MIT News Office].
