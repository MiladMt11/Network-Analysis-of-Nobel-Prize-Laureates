==Biography==

===Early years===
Born in [[Lille]], [[France]], Perrin attended the [[École Normale Supérieure]], the elite [[Grandes écoles|grande école]] in [[Paris]]. He became an assistant at the school during the period of 1894–97 when he began the study of [[cathode rays]] and [[X-rays]].  He was awarded the degree of ''docteur ès sciences'' (beyond PhD) in 1897.   In the same year he was appointed as a lecturer in [[physical chemistry]] at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], [[Paris]].  He became a professor at the University in 1910, holding this post until the [[German occupation of France during World War II]].

===Research and achievements===
[[File:Jean Perrin 1908.jpg|thumb|235px|Jean Perrin in 1908]]
In 1895, Perrin showed that cathode rays were of negative electric charge in nature. He determined Avogadro's number (now known as the [[Avogadro constant]]) by several methods. He explained [[solar energy]] as due to the [[thermonuclear]] reactions of [[hydrogen]].

After [[Albert Einstein]] published (1905) his theoretical explanation of [[Brownian motion]] in terms of [[atom]]s, Perrin did the experimental work to test and verify Einstein's predictions, thereby settling the century-long dispute about [[John Dalton]]'s [[atomic theory]]. [[Carl Benedicks]] argued Perrin should receive the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]; Perrin received the award in 1926 for this and other work on the discontinuous structure of matter, which put a definite end to the [[History of the molecule|long struggle]] regarding the question of the physical reality of molecules.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UQ3_ZwdrUUwC&q=Carl+Benedicks&pg=PA144 |title= Nobel Laureates and Twentieth-Century Physics |pages= 114–116 |publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn= 0521540089 |author= Mauro Dardo|year= 2004 |access-date= 13 February 2014}}</ref>

Perrin was the author of a number of books and dissertations. Most notable of his publications were: "Rayons cathodiques et rayons X"; "Les Principes"; "Electrisation de contact"; "Réalité moléculaire"; "Matière et Lumière"; "Lumière et Reaction chimique".

Perrin was also the recipient of numerous prestigious awards including the Joule Prize of the Royal Society in 1896 and the La Caze Prize of the [[French Academy of Sciences]].  He was twice appointed a member of the [[Solvay Conference|Solvay Committee]] at Brussels in 1911 and in 1921. He also held memberships with the [[Royal Society]] of London and with the Academies of Sciences of Belgium, Sweden, Turin, Prague, Romania and China. He became a Commander of the [[Legion of Honour]] in 1926 and was made Commander of the [[Order of Léopold]] (Belgium).

In 1919, Perrin proposed that [[nuclear reaction]]s can provide the source of energy in stars. He realized that the mass of a helium atom is less than that of four atoms of hydrogen, and that the [[mass-energy equivalence]] of Einstein implies that the nuclear fusion (4 H → He) could liberate sufficient energy to make stars shine for billions of years.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131203024638/http://www.astronomyhouston.org/sites/default/files/guidestar/2012October.pdf Why the Stars Shine] D.Selle, Guidestar (Houston Astronomical Society), October 2012, p.6-8</ref> A similar theory was first proposed by American chemist [[William Draper Harkins]] in 1915.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DoSXEGCeBmoC&q=harkins+fusion+four+years&pg=PA173|title=Māyā in Physics|year=1991|publisher=Motilal Banarsidess (Delhi) |isbn=81-208-0698-0|author=N.C.Panda|page=173}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal

In 1927, he founded the Institut de Biologie Physico-Chimique together with chemist André Job and physiologist André Mayer. Funding was provided by [[Edmond James de Rothschild]].<ref name=Zeitoun1>{{cite web |url=http://www2.cnrs.fr/presse/journal/4468.htm |title=Le CNRS a 70 ans |last=Zeitoun |first=Charline |date=September 2009 |work=[[CNRS]] le journal |access-date=February 23, 2012 }}</ref> In 1937, Perrin established the [[Palais de la Découverte]], a [[science museum]] in [[Paris]].

Perrin is considered the founding father of the National Centre for Scientific Research ([[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]] (CNRS)). Following a petition by Perrin signed by over 80 scientists, among them eight Nobel Prize laureates, the French education minister set up the Conseil Supérieur de la Recherche Scientifique (French National Research Council) in April 1933. In 1936, Perrin, now an undersecretary for research, founded the Service Central de la Recherche Scientifique (French Central Agency for Scientific Research).<ref name=Zeitoun1/> Both institutions were merged under the CNRS umbrella on October 19, 1939.<ref name=Guthleben1>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnrs.fr/ComiHistoCNRS/spip.php?article2 |title=Un peu d'histoire... La création du CNRS |last=Guthleben |first=Denis |date=November 3, 2010 |work=Comité pour l’histoire du [[CNRS]] |access-date=February 23, 2012 }}</ref>

His notable students include [[Pierre Victor Auger]]. Jean Perrin was the father of [[Francis Perrin (physicist)|Francis Perrin]], also a physicist.

===Personal life===
Perrin was an atheist and a socialist.<ref>{{cite book|title=New Trends in Fluorescence Spectroscopy: Applications to Chemical and Life Sciences|url=https://archive.org/details/newtrendsfluores00vale|url-access=limited|year=2001|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-67779-6|authors=Bernard Valeur, Jean-Claude Brochon|page=[https://archive.org/details/newtrendsfluores00vale/page/n38 17]|quote=Jean and Francis Perrin held similar political and philosophical ideas. Both were socialists and atheists.}}</ref> He was an officer in the engineer corps during [[World War I]].

After the death of Perrin's wife Henriette in 1938, [[Nine Choucroun]] (1896–1978), founder of the ''[[Nine Choucroun#Nine Choucroun Prize|Nine Choucroun Prize]]'', became Perrin's partner. In June 1940, when the Germans invaded France, Choucroun and Perrin escaped to [[Casablanca]] on the [[ocean liner]] ''Massilia'', with part of the French government. In December 1941, they boarded the ''SS Excambion'' to New York City, arriving on December 23.<ref name="Diane Dosso">Diane Dosso, " Le plan de sauvetage des scientifiques français, New York, 1940–1942 ", ''Revue de synthèse'', Vol. 127, Nr. 2, octobre 2006, p. 429-451 {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

After the War, in 1948, his remains were transported back to France by the cruiser ''Jeanne d'Arc'' and buried in the [[Panthéon]].
