'''Louis J. Ignarro''' (born May 31, 1941) is an [[United States|American]] [[pharmacologist]]. For demonstrating the signaling properties of [[nitric oxide]],  he was co-recipient of the 1998 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] with [[Robert F. Furchgott]] and [[Ferid Murad]].

Currently, he is professor emeritus of [[pharmacology]] at the [[UCLA School of Medicine]]'s department of molecular and medical pharmacology in Los Angeles, which he joined in 1985.<ref>{{cite web| last1=Ignarro| first1=Louis J.| title=Louis J. Ignarro, Ph.D.|url= http://faculty.pharmacology.ucla.edu/institution/personnel?personnel%5fid=45458 |website=Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, University of California Los Angeles : Faculty Research| publisher=University of California Los Angeles|access-date=25 April 2018 |location=Los Angeles}}</ref>  Before relocating to California, he was a professor of pharmacology at [[Tulane University]] School of Medicine, New Orleans, for 12 years.  Ignarro has also previously worked as a staff scientist, research department, for the pharmaceutical division of [[Novartis|CIBA-GEIGY]] Corporation in New York.

Ignarro has published numerous research articles. He received the Basic Research Prize of the [[American Heart Association]] in 1998.  This was in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the advancement of cardiovascular science. That same year, he was inducted into the National Academy of Sciences and the following year, into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  Because nitric oxide is indirectly involved in the action of this drug,  he is sometimes referred to as the "Father of Viagra".<ref>[http://www.aeispeakers.com/print.php?SpeakerID=1378 AEI Speaker's Bureau]</ref>

He is the founder of the Nitric Oxide Society, and founder and editor-in-chief of ''Nitric Oxide Biology and Chemistry.''<ref name="ucla">{{cite web| url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/PRN-UCLA-Pharmacologist-Wins-Nobel-968.aspx| title=UCLA Pharmacologist Wins Nobel Prize in Medicine for Work on Nitric Oxide as an Important Signaling Chemical| publisher=UCLA| access-date=2012-01-23| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102043645/http://newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/PRN-UCLA-Pharmacologist-Wins-Nobel-968.aspx| archive-date=2014-01-02| url-status=dead}}</ref> Ignarro holds a B.S. in pharmacy, [[Columbia University]], 1962, and a Ph.D. in pharmacology, [[University of Minnesota]], School of Medicine, 1966.

==Personal life==
Louis J. Ignarro was born in 1941 in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. His parents were Italian immigrants and his father was a carpenter in Torre del Greco, near [[Naples]]. Ignarro grew up in [[Long Beach, NY]], which is a suburb of [[New York City, NY]] on the south shore of [[Long Island, NY]]. Ignarro received his first chemistry set as a gift at the age of 8.<ref name="bio">{{Nobelprize|name=Louis J. Ignarro|accessdate=2020-10-22}}</ref>

Ignarro is married to anesthesiologist Dr. Sharon Ignarro and lives in Beverly Hills, CA.<ref name="bio" /> He is an avid cyclist and marathoner, having completed 13 marathons.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://athlinks.com/myresults/29499467/Lou-Ignarro.aspx| title=Lou Ignarro's Race Results| publisher=Athlinks| access-date=2012-01-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| title=Antiangiogenesis: New frontiers in therapeutic development | publisher=Springerlink| doi=10.1007/s10456-005-9025-6 | pmid=16400519 | year=2006 | last1=Lamontagne | first1=Kenneth R. | journal=Angiogenesis | volume=8 | issue=4 | pages=285–287 | s2cid=1790655}}</ref> Ignarro has published multiple books for lay audiences about health and wellness focusing on the benefits of increasing nitric oxide production. He is a frequent public speaker on these and related topics.

==Academic career==
Ignarro attended Central Grade School and Long Beach High School.  A strong interest in science led Ignarro to [[Columbia University]] where he studied chemistry and pharmacology and in 1962 received a bachelor's degree in pharmacy. Ignarro then attended the [[University of Minnesota]] where he received a Ph.D. in pharmacology. His university studies also concentrated in chemistry, enzymology and cardiovascular physiology, which resulted in several published papers. While at the University of Minnesota, Ignarro studied under eventual Nobel Prize-winning chemist [[Paul D. Boyer|Paul Boyer]].<ref name="bio" />

Ignarro's work continued at the [[NIH]] in the fields he'd studied, collaborating with many other scientists to discover regulatory mechanisms of the cardiovascular system that would lead to his most famous work. This was his first time to apply his education outside of an academic setting. In 1968, Ignarro left the NIH to work for Geigy Pharmaceuticals. With this company, Ignarro helped develop new drugs and was able to continue research into new areas of pharmacology including [[Cyclic guanosine monophosphate|cyclic GMP]]. After Geigy merged with Ciba Pharmaceuticals, Ignarro decided to move back to the world of academia, this time as a professor.<ref name="bio" />

In 1973, Ignarro accepted the position of Assistant Professor of pharmacology at [[Tulane University]] School of Medicine in [[New Orleans, LA]]. Tulane was chosen partially because it would provide a good environment for continued research into cyclic GMP. While studying cyclic GMP, Ignarro read a paper by [[Ferid Murad]], who demonstrated that nitric oxide elevates cyclic GMP levels. Ignarro then speculated that nitric oxide could be the key to relaxing vascular smooth muscles.  In turn, this led to his extensive research on the subject.<ref>{{cite web|title= Louis Ignarro, Ph.D. Biography and Interview |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=   https://www.achievement.org/achiever/louis-ignarro-ph-d/#interview}}</ref> Ignarro's research demonstrated that nitric oxide serves the functions of vasorelaxant and inhibitor of platelet aggregation, with both effects mediated by cyclic GMP.

Ignarro continued his research at Tulane.  In 1984 he realized that the properties of nitric oxide were the same as those seen in the endothelium derived relaxing factor ([[EDRF]]) previously identified by Robert Furchgott 3 years earlier. The exact nature of the EDRF was up to this point unknown. Furchgott and Ignarro came to similar conclusions about nitric oxide as the EDRF around the same time, and both presented evidence at conferences during 1986 demonstrating nitric oxide's role as EDRF.<ref name="bio" />

During the decades since Ignarro and Furchgott's initial research, thousands of studies have been published about the effects of nitric oxide as the endothelium derived relaxing factor. This has led to the development of erectile dysfunction drugs such as [[Viagra]] and nutritional supplements designed for cardiovascular health and athletic performance.

In 1985, Ignarro moved from New Orleans to Los Angeles where he accepted a position at the [[UCLA]] School of Medicine and continues to research and teach.<ref name="bio" />

==Herbalife relationship and controversial scientific results==
Ignarro has worked as a paid consultant for [[Herbalife]] since 2003 and later became a member of the company's Scientific Advisory Board. He has collaborated in developing nutritional supplements for cardiovascular health and athletic performance. Ignarro first worked with [[Herbalife]] to develop Niteworks, a dietary supplement designed to boost the body's own production of nitric oxide.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&node=&contentId=A53099-2003Oct6| title=Nitric Oxide Now – Ask Me How| work=Washington Post| access-date=2012-01-26}}</ref> Ignarro endorsed this product in exchange for a royalty agreement reported to have earned his consulting firm over $1 million in the first 12 months.<ref name="bloom">{{cite web| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aFh1K0o4xxQY&refer=columnist_evans| title=Nobel Prize Winner Didn't Disclose Herbalife Contract| publisher=Bloomberg| access-date=2012-01-26}}</ref> Ignarro has continued to work with Herbalife to develop additional supplements focusing on nutrients such as [[Omega-3 fatty acid]] and [[CoQ10]]. As of 2012, Herbalife has made payments to Ignarro and his affiliated consulting firm of over $15 million.<ref name="pershing-square-presentation-53">{{cite web | url=https://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/117631419?access_key=key-onb0qbf3fzdk8g27v7r | title=Who Wants to be a Millionaire? | work=Herbalife Presentation | date=December 17, 2012 | access-date=December 25, 2012 | author=Pershing Square Capital | pages=Slide 53}}</ref>

Ignarro appears in videos promoting Niteworks and other Herbalife products, and is a frequent speaker at Herbalife events. Since partnering with Herbalife, Ignarro has spoken to more than 5,000,000 people worldwide about nitric oxide and cardiovascular health.<ref name="hiw">{{cite web| url=http://healthiswealth.net/index.php?/doctors-orders/archives/dr._louis_ignarro_why_i_chose_herbalife/| title=Why I Chose Herbalife| publisher=HealthWell Ventures| access-date=2012-01-26}}</ref>

Experimental results in some of his non-peer-reviewed scientific publications have been described as fabricated.

==Famous quotes==
While testifying before Congress in 2000, Ignarro remarked: "Only in America could the son of an uneducated carpenter receive the Nobel Prize in Medicine".<ref>{{cite web| url=http://criticalcarecanada.com/faculty/faculty_ignarro.htm| title=Critical Care Canada Form Faculty| publisher=CCCF| access-date=2012-01-26| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124234239/http://www.criticalcarecanada.com/faculty/faculty_ignarro.htm| archive-date=2010-11-24| url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.heartacademy.org/newsletter/6/4.pdf| title=CV Network Online| publisher=International Academy of Cardiovascular Sciences| access-date=2012-01-26}}</ref>
