Kroto promoted science education and was a critic of religious faith.

==Early years==
Kroto was born in [[Wisbech]], [[Isle of Ely]], [[Cambridgeshire]], England, to Edith and Heinz Krotoschiner,<ref name="Nobel Autobiography">{{cite web|title=Sir Harold Kroto – Nobel Autobiography|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1996/kroto-bio.html}}</ref><ref>[http://www.notablebiographies.com/supp/Supplement-Ka-M/Kroto-Harold-Walter.html Harold Walter Kroto Biography – life, family, parents, name, wife, school, mother, young, born, college, time, year, Studied Chemistry in College].

Both of his parents were born in Berlin and fled to Great Britain in the 1930s as [[refugees]] from Nazi Germany; his father was [[Jewish]]. Harry was raised in [[Bolton]] while the British authorities interned his father on the [[Isle of Man]] as an [[enemy alien]] during World War II<ref name="Fleur, Nicholas 2016">"Harold Kroto, Chemist who helped illuminate molecules, dies at 76"], ''The New York Times'', 5 May 2016, pg. B14</ref> and attended [[Bolton School]], where he was a contemporary of the actor [[Ian McKellen]]. In 1955, Harold's father shortened the family name to Kroto.<ref name="Nobel Autobiography"/>

As a child, he became fascinated by a [[Meccano]] set.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Round Peg in a Square World|url=http://vega.org.uk/video/programme/62|website=Vega Science Trust|access-date=23 August 2014}}</ref> Kroto credited Meccano, as well as his aiding his father in the latter's balloon factory after World War II – amongst other things – with developing skills useful in scientific [[research]].<ref name="nobel"/><ref name="Fleur, Nicholas 2016"/> He developed an interest in [[chemistry]], [[physics]], and [[mathematics]] in secondary school, and because his [[sixth form]] chemistry teacher ([[Harry Heaney]] – who subsequently became a university professor) felt that the [[University of Sheffield]] had the best chemistry department in the United Kingdom, he went to Sheffield.

Although raised Jewish, Harry Kroto stated that religion never made any sense to him.<ref name="nobel"/> He was a humanist who claimed to have three religions: Amnesty Internationalism, atheism, and humour.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nobel Laureate talk Inspiration, Education, Science – and Snoopy|url=http://www.skoltech.ru/en/tag/kroto/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Science Studio with Sir Harold Kroto|url=http://thesciencenetwork.org/media/videos/30/Transcript.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Harry Kroto – quotes|url=http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/3096030.Harry_Kroto}}</ref> He was a distinguished supporter of the [[British Humanist Association]].<ref name="humanist">{{cite web|title=Distinguished supporters|url=http://www.humanism.org.uk/about/people/distinguished-supporters|publisher=British Humanist Association|access-date=21 August 2011|date=2011-04-26}}</ref> In 2003 he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the [[Humanism and Its Aspirations|Humanist Manifesto]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://americanhumanist.org/what-is-humanism/manifesto3/signers|title=Humanism and Its Aspirations: Notable Signers|work=Humanism and Its Aspirations: Humanist Manifesto III, a Successor to the Humanist Manifesto of 1933|publisher=American Humanist Association|access-date=7 September 2017}}</ref>

In 2015, Kroto signed the [[Mainau Declaration|Mainau Declaration 2015 on Climate Change]] on the final day of the 65th [[Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings|Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting]]. The declaration was signed by a total of 76 Nobel Laureates and handed to then-President of the French Republic, [[François Hollande]], as part of the successful [[Paris Climate Change Conference|COP21 climate summit]] in Paris.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mainaudeclaration.org/|title=Mainau Declaration|website=www.mainaudeclaration.org|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref>

==Education and academic career==
===Education===
Kroto was educated at Bolton School and went to the University of Sheffield in 1958, where he obtained a first-class honours BSc degree in Chemistry (1961) and a PhD in Molecular Spectroscopy (1964).<ref name="Nobel Autobiography" /> During his time at Sheffield he also was the art editor of ''Arrows'' – the University student magazine, played tennis for the University team (reaching the UAU finals twice) and was President of the Student Athletics Council (1963–64). Among other things such as making the first [[phosphaalkenes]] (compounds with carbon phosphorus double bonds), his doctoral studies included unpublished research on [[carbon suboxide]], O=C=C=C=O, and this led to a general interest in [[molecule]]s containing chains of carbon atoms with numerous multiple bonds. He started his work with an interest in [[organic chemistry]], but when he learned about [[spectroscopy]] it inclined him towards [[quantum chemistry]]; he later developed an interest in [[astrochemistry]].<ref name="Nobel Autobiography" />

After obtaining his PhD, Kroto spent two-years in a postdoctoral position at the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] in Ottawa, Canada carrying out further work in molecular spectroscopy, and also spent the subsequent year at [[Bell Laboratories]] in New Jersey (1966–1967) carrying out Raman studies of liquid phase interactions and worked on quantum chemistry.<ref name="Nobel Autobiography" />

===Research at the University of Sussex===
In 1967, Kroto began teaching and research at the [[University of Sussex]] in England.  During his time at Sussex from 1967 to 1985, he carried out research mainly focused on the spectroscopic studies of new and novel unstable and semi-stable species.  This work resulted in the birth of the various fields of new chemistry involving carbon multiply bonded to second and third row elements e.g. S, Se and P. A particularly important breakthrough (with Sussex colleague John Nixon) was the creation of several new phosphorus species detected by microwave spectroscopy.  This work resulted in the birth of the field(s) of phosphaalkene and phosphaalkyne chemistry.  These species contain carbon double and triple bonded to phosphorus (C=P and C≡P) such as [[cyanophosphaethyne]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=The detection of unstable molecules by microwave spectroscopy: phospha-alkenes|journal=Journal of the Chemical Society, Chemical Communications|year=1976| doi = 10.1039/C39760000513|issue=13|pages=513–515|last1=Simmons|first1=Nigel P. C.|last2=Nixon|first2=John F.|last3=Kroto|first3=Harold W.|last4=Hopkinson|first4=Michael J.}}</ref>

In 1975, he became a full professor of Chemistry. This coincided with laboratory microwave measurements with Sussex colleague David Walton on long linear carbon chain molecules, leading to radio astronomy observations with Canadian astronomers revealing the surprising fact that these unusual carbonaceous species existed in relatively large abundances in interstellar space as well as the outer atmospheres of certain stars – the carbon-rich red giants.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Detection of the Heavy Interstellar Molecule Cyanodiacetylene|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|year=1976|bibcode=1976ApJ...205L.173A |doi=10.1086/182117|volume=205|pages=L173|last1=Avery|first1=L.

===Discovery of buckminsterfullerene===
[[File:C60 Image for Cover cropped 3.png|thumb|Buckminsterfullerene, C60]]
In 1985, on the basis of the Sussex studies and the stellar discoveries, laboratory experiments (with co-workers [[James R. Heath]], Sean C. O'Brien, Yuan Liu, [[Robert Curl]] and [[Richard Smalley]] at Rice University) which simulated the chemical reactions in the atmospheres of the red giant stars demonstrated that stable [[Buckminsterfullerene|C<sub>60</sub> molecules]] could form spontaneously from a condensing carbon vapour.  The co-investigators directed [[laser]]s at graphite and examined the results.<ref name="C60 publication">{{cite journal|last1=Kroto|first1=H. W.|last2=Heath|first2=J. R.|last3=O'Brien|first3=S.

In 1985, the C<sub>60</sub> discovery caused Kroto to shift the focus of his research from spectroscopy in order to probe the consequences of the C<sub>60</sub> structural concept (and prove it correct) and to exploit the implications for chemistry and material science.<ref name=DavidIbberson1991>{{cite journal|last1=David|first1=William I.

This research is significant for the discovery of a new [[Allotropy|allotrope]] of carbon known as a [[fullerene]].  Other [[allotropes of carbon]] include [[graphite]], [[diamond]] and [[graphene]]. Harry Kroto's 1985 paper entitled "C60:  Buckminsterfullerene", published with colleagues J. R. Heath, S. C. O'Brien, R. F. Curl, and R. E. Smalley, was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society, presented to Rice University in 2015.<ref name="Award"/><ref name="Breakthrough"/> The discovery of fullerenes was recognized in 2010 by the designation of a [[National Historic Chemical Landmarks|National Historic Chemical Landmark]] by the [[American Chemical Society]] at the Richard E.

===Educational outreach and public service===

In 1995, he jointly set up the [[Vega Science Trust]], a UK educational charity that created high quality science films including lectures and interviews with Nobel Laureates, discussion programmes, careers and teaching resources for TV and Internet Broadcast. Vega produced over 280 programmes, that streamed for free from the Vega website which acted as a TV science channel. The trust closed in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vega Science Trust to Close|url=http://www.vega.org.uk/news/details/8|publisher=The Vega Science Trust|access-date=2 May 2016}}</ref>

Throughout his entire life, Kroto was a lover of film, theatre, art, and music and published his own artwork.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kroto.info/Graphics/index.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131008140027/http://kroto.info/Graphics/index.html |archive-date=8 October 2013 }}</ref>

===Personal beliefs===
Kroto was a "devout atheist"<ref name="nobel"/> who thought that beliefs in immortality derive from lack of the courage to accept human mortality.<ref name="Nobel Autobiography" /> He was a patron of the [[British Humanist Association]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://humanism.org.uk/about/our-people/patrons/professor-sir-harold-kroto-frs/|title=Professor Sir Harold Kroto FRS|access-date=2 May 2016|publisher=[[British Humanist Association]]|date=2012-05-24}}</ref> He was a supporter of [[Amnesty International]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/3096030.Harry_Kroto|title=Harry W. Kroto quotes|website=Goodreads|access-date=31 August 2014}}</ref> He referred to his view that [[Dogma|religious dogma]] causes people to accept unethical or inhumane actions: "The only mistake [[Bernard Madoff|Bernie Madoff]] made was to promise returns in ''this'' life."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jul/01/religion-euthanasia|title=The curse of religion|author=AC Grayling|newspaper=The Guardian|date=July 2009}}</ref> He held that scientists had a responsibility to work for the benefit of the entire species.<ref>{{cite web|title=Think About It: Nobel Prize Winner Sir Harold Kroto Throws Down the Gauntlet|url=http://www.eln.slas.org/story/1/74-think-about-it-nobel-prize-winner-sir-harold-kroto-throws-down-the-gauntlet-|access-date=6 September 2014}}</ref> On 15 September 2010, Kroto, along with 54 other public figures, signed an open letter published in ''[[The Guardian]]'', stating their opposition to [[Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the United Kingdom|Pope Benedict XVI's state visit to the UK]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/sep/15/harsh-judgments-on-pope-religion|title=Letters: Harsh judgments on the pope and religion|work=The Guardian|access-date=16 September 2010 | location=London | date=15 September 2010}}</ref>

Kroto was an early Signatory of [[Asteroid Day]].<ref name="Observer">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jun/13/asteroid-day-anniversary-tunguska-siberia|title=Asteroid Day tries to save life as we know it|work=The Observer|date=13 June 2015|access-date=13 June 2015}}</ref><ref name="Asteroid Day">{{cite web|url=http://asteroidday.org/page/harold-kroto/|title=Sir Harry Kroto Official page on Asteroid Day|publisher=Asteroid Day|access-date=2 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604140426/http://asteroidday.org/page/harold-kroto/|archive-date=4 June 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2008, Kroto was critical of [[Michael Reiss]] for directing the teaching of [[creationism]] alongside evolution.<ref>{{cite news |first=Harry |last=Kroto |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/sep/28/religion |title=Blinded by a divine light |work=The Guardian |date=28 September 2008 |access-date=12 May 2016 }}</ref>

Kroto praised the increase of organized online information as an "Educational Revolution" and named it as the "GooYouWiki" world referring to [[Google]], [[YouTube]] and [[Wikipedia]].<ref>{{cite web |first=Barry |last=Ray |url=http://news.fsu.edu/More-FSU-News/24-7-News-Archive/2012/October/Kroto-to-lead-discussion-The-GooYouWiki-World-and-the-Educational-Revolution |title=FSU professor, Nobel laureate Kroto to lead discussion, 'The GooYouWiki World and the Educational Revolution' |publisher=FSU |date=16 October 2012 |access-date=12 May 2016 }}</ref>

One of Kroto's favourite quotes was: "I believe in [[Spinoza]]'s God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with the fates and actions of human beings." said by Albert Einstein,<ref>{{cite web |first=Yangguang |last=Ou |url=http://www.jyi.org/issue/a-peek-into-the-mind-of-a-nobel-laureate-an-exclusive-interview-with-sir-harry-kroto/ |title=A Peek into the Mind of a Nobel Laureate: An Exclusive Interview with Sir Harry Kroto |work=Journal of Young Investigators |publisher=Florida State University |date=1 February 2011 |access-date=12 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160505185123/http://www.jyi.org/issue/a-peek-into-the-mind-of-a-nobel-laureate-an-exclusive-interview-with-sir-harry-kroto |archive-date=5 May 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Graphic design===
The discovery of buckminsterfullerene caused Kroto to postpone his dream of setting up an art and graphic design studio – he had been doing graphics semi-professionally for years. However, Kroto's graphic design work resulted in numerous posters, letterheads, logos, book/journal covers, medal design, etc. He produced artwork after receiving graphic awards in the Sunday Times Book Jacket Design<ref name="krotolab">{{cite web|title=Welcome to the Kroto Lab|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/lifesci/krotolab/|archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20160108203114/http://www.sussex.ac.uk/lifesci/krotolab/|url-status=dead|archive-date=8 January 2016|publisher=University of Sussex|access-date=2 May 2016}}</ref> competition (1964) and the Moet Hennesy/Louis Vuitton Science pour l'Art Prize (1994).<ref name="krotolab" /> Other notable graphical works include the design of the Nobel UK Stamp for Chemistry<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stamp-photos.com/picture/number144.asp|title=Stamp Photos}}</ref> (2001) and features at the Royal Academy (London) Summer Exhibition (2004).
