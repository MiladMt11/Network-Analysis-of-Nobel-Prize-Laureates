Hoffmann and [[Bruno Lemaitre]] discovered the function of the fruit fly ''[[Toll (gene)|Toll]]'' gene in [[innate immunity]]. Its mammalian homologs, the [[Toll-like receptor]]s, were discovered by Beutler. Toll-like receptors identify constituents of other organisms like fungi and bacteria, and trigger an immune response, explaining, for example, how [[septic shock]] can be triggered by bacterial remains.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Nobel announcement marred by winner's death |doi=10.1038/478013a |author=Callaway E |journal=Nature |date= 2011 |volume=478 |issue=7367 |pages=13–4 |pmid=21979018|bibcode=2011Natur.478...13C |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ronald |first1=Pamela |last2=Fauquet |first2=Claude |last3=Zhu |first3=Li-Huang |last4=Zhai |first4=Wen-Xue |last5=Wang |first5=Bei |last6=Gardner |first6=J. |last7=Holsten |first7=Tom |last8=Pi |first8=Li-Ya |last9=Kim |first9=Han-Suk |last10=Chen |first10=Li-Li |last11=Wang |first11=Guo-Liang |last12=Song |first12=Wen-Yuan |title=A Receptor Kinase-Like Protein Encoded by the Rice Disease Resistance Gene, Xa21 |journal=Science |date=15 December 1995 |volume=270 |issue=5243 |pages=1804–1806 |doi=10.1126/science.270.5243.1804 |pmid=8525370 |language=en |issn=0036-8075|bibcode=1995Sci...270.1804S |s2cid=10548988 |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4x0247kj }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gomez-Gomez |first1=L.| title = FLS2: an LRR receptor-like kinase involved in the perception of the bacterial elicitor flagellin in Arabidopsis |journal = Molecular Cell | volume = 5 | issue = 6 | pages = 1003–1011| year = 2000 | pmid = 10911994| doi = 10.1016/S1097-2765(00)80265-8 | first2 = Thomas |last2=Boller|display-authors=etal| doi-access = free }}</ref>

==Education==
Jules Hoffmann went to the [[Lycée de Garçons de Luxembourg]] before leaving to France. Hoffmann received undergraduate degrees in biology and chemistry at the [[University of Strasbourg]], France. In 1969, he completed his Ph.D. in biology also at the [[University of Strasbourg]] under Pierre Joly in Laboratory of General Biology at the Institute of Zoology.<ref name="nobelprize" /> His post-doctoral training was at the Institut für Physiologische Chemie at [[Philipps-Universität Marburg|Philipps-Universität]] in [[Marburg an der Lahn]], [[Germany]], in 1973–1974.

==Studies and Research Careers==
During his Ph.D. program under Pierre Joly, Hoffmann started his research in studying antimicrobial defenses in grasshoppers, inspired by the previous works done in the laboratory of Pierre Joly showing that no opportunistic infections were apparent in insects after the transplantation of certain organs from one to another.<ref name="nobelprize" /> Hoffmann confirmed discovery of phagocytosis done by [[Eli Metchnikoff]], through injection of ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]'' and observation of increase of phagocytes.<ref name="nobelprize" /> In addition, he showed strong correlation between hematopoiesis and antimicrobial defenses by assessing the susceptibility of an insect to the microbial infection after X-ray treatment.<ref name="nobelprize" /> Hoffmann shifts from using grasshopper model to using dipteran species in the 80s. By using ''[[Phormia terranovae]]'', Hoffmann and his colleagues were able to identify 82-residues long antimicrobial polypeptide named [[Diptericin]] which was glycine-rich, along with other polypeptides in ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' such as [[Defensin]], [[Cecropin]], and [[Attacin]].<ref name="nobelprize" /> Further molecular genetic analysis revealed that the promoters for the genes encoding these antimicrobial peptides contained DNA sequences similar to the binding elements for NF-κB in mammalian DNA. ''Dorsal'' gene, critical in dorso-ventral patterning in the early embryo of ''Drosophila melanogaster'' was also identified to be in this NF-κB family. It was initially speculated by Hoffmann and colleagues that activity of Dorsal was directly linked to the expression of the ''Diptericin'' gene. However, it turned out that Diptericin was normally induced even in the loss-of-function ''Dorsal'' mutants. Further conducted research showed that Diptericin expression was dependent on the expression of imd gene. Identification of another antifungal peptide named Drosomycin and RNA blots demonstrated that two distinct pathways(Toll, Imd) exist, involving Drosomycin and Diptericin respectively. Similarities of structure and function between several members in the Drosophila embryo and members in mammals being noted, study "The Dorsoventral Regulatory Gene Cassette ''spảtzle/Toll/cactus'' Controls the Potent Antifungal Response in Drosophila Adults"<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80172-5 | last1 = Lemaitre | first1 = B. | last2 = Nicolas | first2 = E. | last3 = Michaut | first3 = L. | last4 = Reichhart | first4 = J.

Later works identified that Toll transmembrane receptors are present in a wide variety of phyla and are conserved through evolution along with conservation of NF-κB activating cascades.<ref name="nobelprize" />

Hoffmann was a research assistant at CNRS from 1964 to 1968, and became a research associate in 1969. Since 1974 he has been a Research Director of CNRS. Between 1978 and 2005 he was Director of the CNRS research unit "Immune Response and Development in Insects", and from 1994 to 2005 he was director of the [[Institut de biologie moléculaire et cellulaire|Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology]] of CNRS in Strasbourg.

Hoffmann is a member of the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]], the [[French Academy of Sciences]], the [[Academia Europaea]], the [[European Molecular Biology Organization]] (EMBO), the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]]{{when|date=January 2017}}, the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the Fondation Écologie d'Avenir<ref>http://fondationecologiedavenir.org/Conseil_Orientation.htm{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]].

Hoffmann became a Commander of the [[Legion of Honour]] in 2012.<ref name="lalsacelegion">{{cite news|title=Légion d'honneur : 15 promus dans le Bas-Rhin|url=http://www.lalsace.fr/actualite/2012/01/04/legion-d-honneur-15-promus-dans-le-bas-rhin|access-date=December 5, 2016|work=L'Alsace|date=January 4, 2012}}</ref>

In 2015, Hoffmann signed the ''[[Mainau Declaration|Mainau Declaration 2015 on Climate Change]]'' on the final day of the 65th [[Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings|Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting]]. The declaration was signed by a total of 76 Nobel Laureates and handed to then-President of the French Republic, [[François Hollande]], as part of the successful [[Paris Climate Change Conference|COP21 climate summit]] in Paris.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mainaudeclaration.org/|title=Mainau Declaration|website=www.mainaudeclaration.org|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref>

== Controversy ==

[[Bruno Lemaitre]], a research associate in the Hoffmann laboratory at the time when the major work on Drosophila innate immunity was conducted (for which Hoffmann was awarded the Nobel), claims he was inadequately recognized by Hoffmann as the instigator of and main contributor to the nobel-winning work. [[Bruno Lemaitre|Lemaitre]] now supervises his own laboratory at the [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne]] in Switzerland.<ref>Travis, John (2011-12-16) [http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2011/12/nobel-prize-immunologists-provokes-yet-another-debate Nobel Prize for Immunologists Provokes Yet Another Debate]. sciencemag.org</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://lemaitrelab.epfl.ch/ | title=UPLEM – Lemaitre Lab}}</ref><ref>Bruno Lemaitre 2016.
