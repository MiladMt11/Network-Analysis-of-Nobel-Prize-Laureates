==Education and early life==
Ramakrishnan was born in a [[Tamils|Tamil]] [[Brahmin]] family of [[Chidambaram]] in [[Cuddalore district]] of [[Tamil Nadu]], India<ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-5099742,prtpage-1.cms|title=Common root: Tamil Nadu gets its third laureate|date=8 October 2009|newspaper=Times of India|agency=TNN}}</ref> to C. V. Ramakrishnan and [[R. Rajalakshmi (scientist)|Rajalakshmi Ramakrishnan]]. Both his parents were scientists, and his father was head of the Department of Biochemistry at the [[Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda]].<ref name=nobio/><ref name=cvramakrishnan>{{cite journal|last1=Ramakrishnan |first1=C.

Ramakrishnan moved to [[Vadodara]] (previously also known as Baroda) in [[Gujarat]] at the age of three, where he had his schooling at Convent of Jesus and Mary, except for spending 1960–61 in [[Adelaide]], Australia. Following his pre-science at the [[Maharaja Sayajirao University of Baroda]], he did his undergraduate studies in the same university on a [[National Talent Search Examination|National Science Talent Scholarship]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in physics in 1971.<ref name=ramak>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419055305/http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/ribo/homepage/ramak/|archive-date=2015-04-19|url=http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/ribo/homepage/ramak/|title=Venkatraman_Ramakrishnan|publisher=University of Cambridge}}</ref> At the time, the physics course at Baroda was new, and based in part on the ''[[Berkeley Physics Course]]'' and ''[[The Feynman Lectures on Physics]]''.<ref name=nobio/>

Immediately after graduation he moved to the US, where he obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in physics from [[Ohio University]] in 1976 for research into the [[Ferroelectricity|ferroelectric]] [[phase transition]] of [[Monopotassium phosphate|potassium dihydrogen phosphate]] (KDP)<ref name=venkiphd>{{cite thesis|degree=PhD |first=Venkatraman |last=Ramakrishnan |title=The Green function theory of the ferroelectric phase transition in KDP |institution=Ohio University |date=1976 |id={{proquest|302809453}} |oclc=3079828}}</ref> supervised by Tomoyasu Tanaka.<ref name=physrevb>{{cite journal|last1=Ramakrishnan |first1=Venkatraman |last2=Tanaka |first2=Tomoyasu |title=Green's-function theory of the ferroelectric phase transition in potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KDP) |journal=[[Physical Review B]] |volume=16 |issue=1 |year=1977 |pages=422–426 |doi=10.1103/physrevb.16.422 |bibcode=1977PhRvB..16..422R}}</ref><ref name="toi">{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-5098151,prtpage-1.cms |title=Venkatraman Ramakrishnan: a profile |newspaper=Times of India|access-date=2009-10-07 |date=2009-10-07}}</ref><ref name="reuters">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/articlePrint?articleId=USTRE5962EE20091007 |title=Factbox: Nobel chemistry prize&nbsp;– Who are the winners?|access-date=2009-10-07 |work=Reuters |date=2009-10-07}}</ref> Then he spent two years studying biology as a graduate student at the [[University of California, San Diego]] while making a transition from theoretical physics to biology.<ref name="iex">{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/story-print/526251/ |title=Profile: Dr Venkatraman Ramakrishnan |date=7 October 2009 |newspaper=[[Indian Express]] |access-date=2009-10-07}}</ref>

==Career and research==
Ramakrishnan began work on [[ribosomes]] as a [[postdoctoral researcher|postdoctoral fellow]] with [[Peter Moore (chemist)|Peter Moore]] at [[Yale University]].<ref name=ramak/> After his [[postdoctoral research|post-doctoral fellowship]], he initially could not find a faculty position even though he had applied to about 50 universities in the U.S.<ref name="timesofindia.indiatimes.com">{{cite news| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Nobel-laureate-Venkat-Ramakrishnan-failed-IIT-medical-entrance-tests/articleshow/5414148.cms | work=The Times Of India | title=Nobel laureate Venkat Ramakrishnan failed IIT, medical entrance tests | date=2010-01-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title= Venki Ramakrishnan, Ph.D. Biography and Interview |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://achievement.org/achiever/venki-ramakrishnan-ph-d/#interview}}</ref>

He continued to work on ribosomes from 1983–95 as a staff scientist at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]].<ref name=brookhaven/> In 1995 he  moved to the [[University of Utah]] as a Professor of Biochemistry, and in 1999, he moved to his current position at the Medical Research Council [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]] in [[Cambridge]], England, where he had also been a sabbatical visitor during 1991–92 on a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]].

In 1999, Ramakrishnan's laboratory published a 5.5 [[angstrom]] resolution structure of the [[30S]] subunit. The following year, his laboratory determined the complete molecular structure of the 30S subunit of the [[ribosome]] and its complexes with several [[antibiotics]]. This was followed by studies that provided structural insights into the mechanism that ensures the fidelity of [[protein biosynthesis]]. In 2007, his laboratory determined the atomic structure of the whole [[ribosome]] in complex with its [[tRNA]] and [[mRNA]] ligands. Since 2013, he has  used [[cryo-EM]] to work primarily on eukaryotic and mitochondrial translation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Fernández|first1=Israel S.|last2=Bai|first2=Xiao-Chen|last3=Hussain|first3=Tanweer|last4=Kelley|first4=Ann C.|last5=Lorsch|first5=Jon R.|last6=Ramakrishnan|first6=V.|last7=Scheres|first7=Sjors H.

===Views as President of the Royal Society (2015-2020)===
Ramakrishnan's term was dominated by Brexit and, in his final year, the COVID-19 pandemic and its response.<ref>{{cite web|author=Clive Cookson|date=20 November 2020|title='Voice of British science fights for future of UK research'|url=https://www.ft.com/content/dcc54f4e-9ace-41e5-8a0e-51a65abe3396|newspaper=The Financial Times}}</ref> In an interview in July 2018, he said that Britain's decision to leave the European Union ([[Brexit]]) was hurting Britain's reputation as a good place to work in science, commenting "It's very hard for the science community to see any advantages in Brexit. They are pretty blunt about that." He saw advantages to both the UK and the EU for Britain to continue to be engaged in [[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]] and [[Euratom]], which, unlike the [[European Medicines Agency]], are not EU agencies.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ian Tucke|date=15 July 2018|title=Venkatraman Ramakrishnan: 'Britain's reputation has been hurt'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/jul/15/venkatraman-ramakrishnan-interview-brexit-science-funding-innovation-collaboration-royal-society|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>

Ramakrishnan argued that a no deal [[Brexit]] would harm science.  Ramakrishnan wrote, "A deal on science is in the best interests of Europe as a whole and should not be sacrificed as collateral damage over disagreements on other issues.  If we are going to successfully tackle global problems like climate change, human disease and food security, we can't do so in isolation. There is no scenario where trashing our relationships with our closest scientific collaborators in the EU gets us closer to these goals."<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/brexit-no-deal-science-the-royal-society-venki-ramakrishnan-a8471326.html A no-deal Brexit would be a disaster for the UK science community] ''[[The Independent]]''</ref>

In 2014, he was awarded the XLVI [[:es:Premio Lección Conmemorativa Jiménez Díaz|Jiménez-Díaz Prize]] by the Fundación Conchita Rábago (Spain). In 2017, Ramakrishnan received the Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Golden Plate Awardees of the American Academy of Achievement |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=  https://achievement.org/our-history/golden-plate-awards/#science-exploration}}</ref> Ramakrishnan was included as one of 25 Greatest Global Living Indians by [[NDTV]] Channel, India on 14 December 2013. His certificate of election to the Royal Society reads:

{{quote|Ramakrishnan is internationally recognised for determination of the atomic structure of the [[30S]] ribosomal subunit. Earlier he mapped the arrangement of proteins in the 30S subunit by [[neutron diffraction]] and solved [[X-ray crystallography|X-ray structures]] of individual components and their RNA complexes. Fundamental insights came from his crystallographic studies of the complete 30S subunit. The atomic model included over 1500 bases of [[RNA]] and 20 associated proteins. The RNA interactions representing the [[P-site]] [[Transfer RNA|tRNA]] and the mRNA binding site were identified and the likely modes of action of many clinically important antibiotics determined. His most recent work goes to the heart of the decoding mechanism showing the 30S subunit complexed with poly-U mRNA and the [[stem-loop]] of the cognate [[phenylalanine]] tRNA. [[Transfer RNA#Anticodon|Anti-codon]] recognition leaves the "[[Wobble base pair|wobble" base]] free to accommodate certain non-Watson/Crick [[base pair|basepairs]], thus providing an atomic description of both codon:anti-codon recognition and "wobble". He has also made substantial contributions to understanding how [[chromatin]] is organised, particularly the structure of linker [[histone]]s and their role in [[Protein folding|higher order folding]].<ref name=royal>{{cite web |url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqPos=1&dsqSearch=%28%28text%29%3D%27ramakrishnan%27%29 |title=Venkatraman Ramakrishnan: Certificate of Election EC/2003/31 |publisher=The Royal Society |archive-date=18 June 2015 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZNwVKXUn?url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqPos=1&dsqSearch=((text)='ramakrishnan') |location=London |year=2003 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all |access-date=18 June 2015 }}</ref>}}

While he prefers not to use titles and post-nominals in reference, Ramakrishnan is entitled to use the title of "[[Sir]]" and post-nominals of "[[Knight Bachelor|Kt]]" and [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]].
