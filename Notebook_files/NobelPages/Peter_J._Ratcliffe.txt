==Research==
[[File:HIF Nobel Prize Physiology Medicine 2019 Hegasy ENG.png|thumb|left|Illustration of how cells sense and adapt to oxygen availability]]
In 1989, Ratcliffe established a laboratory in [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]]'s [[Nuffield Department of Population Health|Nuffield Department of Medicine]] to explore the regulation of [[erythropoietin]] (EPO), a hormone released by the [[kidney]]s and responsible for stimulating the production of [[red blood cell]]s. EPO was known to be produced by the kidneys in response to low oxygen levels, and Ratcliffe's work looked to understand the mechanisms of how the kidneys detected hypoxia (low oxygen levels in the blood) to trigger EPO production. From his studies, Ratcliffe discovered that the [[mRNA]] from kidneys that were part of the EPO production pathway that were capable of detecting hypoxia was also present in several other organs, both human and animal, including the spleen, brain, and testes.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Hurst|first=Jillian H.|date=13 September 2016|title=William Kaelin, Peter Ratcliffe, and Gregg Semenza receive the 2016 Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award|journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation|volume=126|issue=10|pages=3628–3638|doi=10.1172/JCI90055|issn=0021-9738|pmc=5096796|pmid=27620538|quote=Further support for an oxygen-sensing mechanism was provided by the discovery of erythropoietin (EPO), a glycoprotein hormone that stimulates [[erythrocyte]] production [...] During the same time period in which Semenza was developing EPO-transgenic mice, Peter Ratcliffe, a physician and kidney specialist, was establishing a laboratory in Oxford University’s Nuffield Department of Medicine to study the regulation of EPO}}</ref> His group found that cells from these organs could switch on EPO production when deprived of oxygen.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/professor-sir-peter-ratcliffe-give-years-linacre-lecture|title=Professor Sir Peter Ratcliffe to give this year's Linacre Lecture|date=11 January 2018|website=St John's College Cambridge|access-date=9 October 2019}}</ref> Further, Ratcliffe was able to modify other cells using the identified mRNA to give these cells oxygen-sensing capabilities.<ref name=":0"/>

Building on these discoveries, the Ratcliffe group, along with joint studies with [[William Kaelin]] and [[Gregg Semenza]], helped to uncover a detailed molecular chain of events that cells use to sense oxygen. A specific step identified was the binding of proteins expressed by the [[Von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor]] gene (VHL) to [[hypoxia-inducible factors]] (HIF), a [[transcription factor]] which trans-activates the EPO gene. Ratcliffe found that the VHL protein can bind a hydroxylated residues of HIF when oxygen is present at acceptable levels; the VHL protein then ubiquitylates the HIF protein which ultimately leads to the HIF protein's destruction. When oxygen levels fall, oxygen-requiring [[HIF hydroxylase]] enzymes, PHD1, 2 and 3 no longer act and VHL does not bind HIF, allowing HIF to remain and activate the EPO gene. This is a process that takes minutes to complete allowing the body to react quickly to hypoxia.<ref name="nature">{{cite journal | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02963-0 | title = Biologists who decoded how cells sense oxygen win medicine Nobel | first1 = Heidi | last1 = Ledford | first2 = Ewen | last2 = Callaway  |date = 7 October 2019 | access-date = 9 October 2019 | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 574 | issue = 7777 | pages = 161–162 | doi = 10.1038/d41586-019-02963-0 | pmid = 31595071 | bibcode = 2019Natur.574..161L | s2cid = 203928827 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

This same pathway is also switched on in many cancer tumours, allowing them to create new blood vessels to sustain their growth. Much of the current understanding of hypoxia has emerged from the laboratory of Ratcliffe.<ref name="oxnbl" /> The understanding of the molecular pathway of EPO production from hypoxia has led to the development of drugs that block VHL from binding with HIF to help treat patients with [[anaemia]] and [[kidney failure]].<ref name="nature"/>

== Personal life ==
Ratcliffe married Fiona Mary MacDougall in 1983.<ref name="Who's Who" />
