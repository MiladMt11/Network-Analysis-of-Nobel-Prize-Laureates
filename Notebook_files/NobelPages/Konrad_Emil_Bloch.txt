==Life and career==
[[File:Konrad Bloch 1963.jpg|thumb|left|Bloch {{circa}} 1963]]
Bloch was born in [[Nysa, Poland|Neisse (Nysa)]], in the [[German Empire]]'s [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] [[Province of Silesia]]. He was the second child of middle-class [[Jewish]] parents Hedwig (Striemer) and Frederich D. "Fritz" Bloch.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Annual Review of Biochemistry |title=Summing Up |year=1987 |volume=56 |pages=1–19 |pmid=3304130 |author= Bloch, K. |doi=10.1146/annurev.bi.56.070187.000245|doi-access=free }}</ref> He was a student [[Kolegium Carolinum Neisse|Carolinum in Nysa]] and then 1930 to 1934, he studied chemistry at the [[Technical University of Munich]]. In 1934, due to the [[Nazism|Nazi]] persecutions of [[Jew]]s, he fled to the ''Schweizerische Forschungsinstitut'' in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]], before moving to the [[United States]] in 1936. Later he was appointed to the department of biological chemistry at [[Yale Medical School]].

In the United States, Bloch enrolled at [[Columbia University]], and received a [[Ph.D]] in biochemistry in 1938. He taught at Columbia from 1939 to 1946. From there he went to the [[University of Chicago]] and then to [[Harvard University]] as [[Eugene Higgins|Higgins]] Professor of Biochemistry in 1954, a post he held until 1982. After retirement at Harvard, he served as the Mack and Effie Campbell Tyner Eminent Scholar Chair in the College of Human Sciences at [[Florida State University]].<ref name=brit/>

Bloch shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1964 with [[Feodor Lynen]], for their discoveries concerning the mechanism and regulation of the [[cholesterol]] and [[fatty acid]] metabolism. Their work showed that the body first makes [[squalene]] from acetate over many steps and then converts the squalene to cholesterol. He traced all the carbon atoms in cholesterol back to acetate. Some of his research was conducted using radioactive acetate in bread mold: this was possible because [[fungi]] also produce squalene. He confirmed his results using rats. He was one of several researchers who showed that acetyl [[Coenzyme A]] is turned into [[mevalonic acid]]. Both Bloch and Lynen then showed that mevalonic acid is converted into chemically active [[isoprene]], the precursor to squalene.<ref name=bloch-faq /> Bloch also discovered that bile and a female sex hormone were made from cholesterol, which led to the discovery that all steroids were made from cholesterol.<ref name=sandwalk-nobel>{{cite web |url= http://sandwalk.blogspot.ca/2007/11/nobel-laureates-konrad-bloch-and-feodor.html |author=S.

In 1985, Bloch became a Fellow of the [[Royal Society]]. In 1988, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]].<ref>[https://www.nsf.gov/od/nms/recip_details.cfm?recip_id=46 The President's National Medal of Science: Recipient Details. Konrad E.

Bloch and his wife Lore Teutsch first met in Munich. They married in the U.S. in 1941. They had two children, Peter Conrad Bloch and Susan Elizabeth Bloch, and two grandchildren, Benjamin Nieman Bloch and Emilie Bloch Sondel. He was fond of skiing, tennis, and music.<ref name=bloch-faq>{{cite web |url= http://www.faqs.org/health/bios/38/Konrad-Bloch.html |publisher= Internet FAQ Archive |title = Konrad Bloch Biography (1912-) |access-date=2013-11-14 }}</ref> Konrad died in [[Burlington, Massachusetts]] of congestive heart failure in 2000, aged 88.<ref>{{cite news |title=Konrad Bloch, Nobel winner, dies at 88 |url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2000/10/konrad-bloch-nobel-winner-dies-at-88/ |access-date=10 October 2020 |work=Harvard Gazette |date=19 October 2000}}</ref> Lore Bloch died in 2010 aged 98.<ref>[https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/lore-bloch-obituary?pid=139869210 Lore Bloch Obituary - Lexington, Massachusetts].
