'''Melvin Schwartz''' ({{IPAc-en|ʃ|w|ɔr|t|s}}; November 2, 1932 – August 28, 2006) was an American [[physicist]]. He shared the 1988 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] with [[Leon M. Lederman]] and [[Jack Steinberger]] for their development of the [[neutrino]] [[Accelerator neutrino|beam]] method and their demonstration of the doublet structure of the [[lepton]]s through the discovery of the [[muon]] neutrino.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Samios, Nicholas P.|title=Obituary: Melvin Schwartz|journal=Physics Today|date=December 2006|volume=59|issue=12|pages=75–76|doi=10.1063/1.2435691|bibcode = 2006PhT....59l..75S }}</ref>

==Biography==
He was Jewish.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/melvin-schwartz |title = Melvin Schwartz}}</ref> He grew up in [[New York City]] in the [[Great Depression]] and went to the [[Bronx High School of Science]]. His interest in physics began there at the age of 12.

He earned his [[B.A.]] (1953) and [[Ph.D.]] (1958) at [[Columbia University]], where [[Nobel Prize|Nobel]] laureate [[I. I. Rabi]] was the head of the physics department. Schwartz became an assistant professor at Columbia in 1958.  He was promoted to associate professor in 1960 and  full professor in 1963.  [[Tsung-Dao Lee]], a Columbia colleague who had recently won the Nobel prize at age 30, inspired the experiment for which Schwartz received his Nobel.  Schwartz and his colleagues performed the experiments which led to their Nobel Prize in the early 1960s, when all three were on the Columbia faculty.  The experiment was carried out at the nearby [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]].

In 1966, after 17 years at Columbia, he moved west to [[Stanford University]], where [[SLAC]], a new accelerator, was just being completed. There, he was involved in research investigating the charge asymmetry in the decay of long-lived neutral kaons and another project which produced and detected relativistic hydrogen-like atoms made up of a pion and a muon.

In the 1970s he founded and became president of [[Digital Pathways]]. In 1972 he published a textbook on classical electrodynamics that has become a standard reference for intermediate and advanced students for its particularly clear exposition of the basic physical principles of the theory.<ref>{{cite book | author=Schwartz, Melvin | title=Principles of Electrodynamics | publisher=McGraw-Hill  |date=1972 | location=New York}}</ref> In 1991, he became Associate Director of High Energy and Nuclear Physics at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]. At the same time, he rejoined the Columbia faculty as Professor of Physics. He became [[I. I. Rabi]] Professor of Physics in 1994 and retired as Rabi Professor Emeritus in 2000.  He spent his retirement years in [[Ketchum, Idaho]], and died August 28, 2006 at a Twin Falls, Idaho, nursing home after struggling with Parkinson's disease and hepatitis C.
