==Career and research==
After a few [[postdoctoral]] positions, including positions at the [[University of Birmingham]], collaborating with [[David Thouless]],<ref name="UoBNobel" /> and at [[Cornell University]],<ref name="UoBNobel" /> he was appointed to the faculty of the [[University of Birmingham]] in 1974,<ref name="UoBNobel" /> first as a lecturer and, later, as a reader. Since 1982, he has been professor of physics at [[Brown University]]. Kosterlitz is currently{{when|date=October 2016}} a visiting research fellow at [[Aalto University]] in Finland{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} and since 2016 a distinguished professor at [[Korea Institute for Advanced Study]].

Kosterlitz does research in [[condensed matter]] theory, one- and two-dimensional physics; in [[phase transitions]]: random systems, [[electron localization]], and [[spin glasses]]; and in critical dynamics: [[melting]] and [[freezing]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}
