'''Eduard Buchner''' ({{IPA-de|ˈeːduaʁt ˈbuːxnɐ|-|De-Eduard Buchner.ogg}}; 20 May 1860 – 13 August 1917) was a [[Germany|German]] [[chemistry|chemist]] and [[Zymurgy|zymologist]], awarded the 1907 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his work on [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Eduard Buchner - Biographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1907/buchner/biographical/|access-date=2020-10-22|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US}}</ref>

== Biography==

===Early years===
Buchner was born in [[Munich]] to a physician and Doctor Extraordinary of Forensic Medicine. His older brother was [[Hans Ernst August Buchner]].<ref name="Asimov">{{cite book | last=Asimov | first=I. | title=Asimov's Biographical Encyclopedia of Science and Technology: The Lives and Achievements of 1510 Great Scientists from Ancient Times to the Present Chronologically Arranged | publisher=Doubleday | series=Biographical encyclopedia of science and technology | year=1982 | isbn=978-0-385-17771-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=olxQAAAAMAAJ }}</ref> In 1884, he began studies of chemistry with [[Adolf von Baeyer]] and of botany with [[Carl Nägeli]], at the Botanic Institute in Munich. After a period working with Otto Fischer (cousin of [[Emil Fischer]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Emil Fischer - Biographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1902/fischer/biographical/|access-date=2020-10-22|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US}}</ref>) at the [[University of Erlangen–Nuremberg|University of Erlangen]], Buchner was awarded a doctorate from the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University of Munich]] in 1888 under [[Theodor Curtius]].<ref name=":0" />

===Academics===
Buchner was appointed assistant lecturer in the organic laboratory of [[Adolf von Baeyer]] in 1889 at the University of Munich. In 1891, he was promoted to lecturer at the same university.<ref name=":0" />

In the autumn of 1893, Buchner moved to [[University of Kiel]] and appointed professor in 1895. In the next year he was appointed Professor Extraordinary for Analytical and Pharmaceutical Chemistry in the chemical laboratory of H. von Pechmann at the [[University of Tübingen]].<ref name=":0" />

In October, 1898, he was appointed to the Chair of General Chemistry in the [[Agricultural University of Berlin]], fully training his assistants by himself, and received his rehabilitation in 1900.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Eduard Buchner - Universitäts-Archiv|url=https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/uniarchiv/personalities/gelehrte/eduard-buchner/|access-date=2020-10-27|website=www.uni-wuerzburg.de |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201102095115/https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/en/uniarchiv/personalities/gelehrte/eduard-buchner/ |archive-date=2 November 2020 }}</ref>

In 1909, he was transferred to the [[University of Breslau]] (reorganised to be [[University of Wrocław]] in 1945<ref>{{Cite web|title=History of the University of Wrocław|url=https://uni.wroc.pl/en/history-of-the-university-of-wroclaw/|access-date=2020-10-22|website=Uniwersytet Wrocławski|language=pl}}</ref>), and in 1911, he moved to [[University of Würzburg]].<ref name=":0" />

==== The Nobel Prize ====
Buchner received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1907.<ref name=":0" /> The experiment for which Buchner won the Nobel Prize consisted of producing a [[Cell-free system|cell-free]] extract of [[yeast]] cells and showing that this "press juice" could ferment sugar. This dealt yet another blow to [[vitalism]] by showing that the presence of living yeast cells was not needed for fermentation. The cell-free extract was produced by combining dry yeast cells, [[quartz]] and [[kieselguhr]] and then pulverizing the yeast cells with a pestle and mortar. This mixture would then become moist as the yeast cells' contents would come out of the cells. Once this step was done, the moist mixture would be put through a press and the resulting "press juice" had [[glucose]], [[fructose]], or [[maltose]] added and [[carbon dioxide]] was seen to evolve, sometimes for days. Microscopic investigation revealed no living yeast cells in the extract. Buchner hypothesized that yeast cells secrete proteins into their environment in order to ferment sugars, but it was later found that fermentation occurs inside the yeast cells. [[Maria Manasseina]] claimed to have discovered free-cell fermentation a generation earlier than Buchner,<ref>{{Cite journal|author-link1=Athel Cornish-Bowden|author=Cornish-Bowden, Athel|journal=The Biochemist|volume=19|issue=2|pages=36–38|year=1999|url=http://bip.cnrs-mrs.fr/bip10/thebct.htm|title=The Origins of Enzymology|language=en|access-date=2017-10-18}}</ref> but Buchner and Rapp considered that she was subjectively convinced of the existence of an enzyme of fermentation, and that her experimental evidence was unconvincing.<ref>

===Personal life===

Buchner married Lotte Stahl in 1900. At the outbreak of the First World War he volunteered and rose to the rank of Major commanding a munition-transport unit on the western and then eastern front. In March 1916 he returned the University of Wurzburg. In April 1917 he volunteered again. On 11 August 1917, while stationed at [[Focșani]], Romania,  he was hit by a shell fragment and died two days later.<ref name="Ukrow">{{cite book | last = Ukrow | first = Rolf | title = Nobelpreisträger Eduard Buchner (1860 – 1917) Ein Leben für die Chemie der Gärungen und - fast vergessen - für die organische Chemie (German)| year = 2004 | location = Berlin | url =https://depositonce.tu-berlin.de/handle/11303/1289}}</ref> He died in the [[Battle of Mărășești]] and is buried in the cemetery of German soldiers from Focșani, Romania.<ref name="Ukrow"/>

Though it is believed by some that the [[Büchner flask]] and the [[Büchner funnel]] are named for him, they are actually named for the industrial chemist [[Ernst Büchner]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Jensen, William|year=2006|title=The Origins of the Hirsch and Büchner Vacuum Filtration Funnels|url=http://search.jce.divched.org/JCEIndex/FMPro?-db=jceindex.fp5&-lay=wwwform&combo=Filtration%20Funnels&-find=&-format=detail.html&-skip=0&-max=1&-token.2=0&-token.3=10|url-status=dead|journal=Journal of Chemical Education|volume=83|issue=9|pages=1283|bibcode=2006JChEd..83.1283J|doi=10.1021/ed083p1283|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829105632/http://search.jce.divched.org/JCEIndex/FMPro?-db=jceindex.fp5&-lay=wwwform&combo=Filtration%20Funnels&-find=&-format=detail.html&-skip=0&-max=1&-token.2=0&-token.3=10|archive-date=2009-08-29}}</ref>
