== Early life and education ==
Nambu was born in [[Tokyo]], Japan, in 1921. After graduating from the then [[Fukui Prefectural Fujishima High School|Fukui Secondary High School]] in [[Fukui, Fukui|Fukui City]], he enrolled in the [[University of Tokyo|Imperial University of Tokyo]] and studied physics. He received his Bachelor of Science in 1942 and Doctorate of Science in 1952.<ref name=Nobel/> In 1949 he was appointed to associate professor at [[Osaka City University]]<ref name=Tokyo/> and promoted to professorship the next year at the age of 29.<ref name="Nobel"/>

In 1952, he was invited by the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], United States, to study. He moved to the [[University of Chicago]] in 1954 and was promoted to professor in 1958.<ref>[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2008-10-08/news/0810070528_1_university-of-chicago-physicist-yoichiro-nambu-subatomic Chicago Tribune (October 8, 2008) "University of Chicago physicist Yoichiro Nambu wins Nobel Prize"]</ref> From 1974 to 1977 he was also Chairman of the Department of Physics.<ref name=grimes>{{citation |last=Grimes |first=William |title=Yoichiro Nambu, Nobel-Winning Physicist, Dies at 94 | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=17 July 2015 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/18/us/yoichiro-nambu-nobel-winning-physicist-dies-at-94.html}}</ref>  He became a United States citizen in 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=95460513|title=Chicago Professor Shares Nobel Prize In Physics|author=Matt Moore|author2=Karl Ritter|author3=Mari Yamaguchi|author4=Herbert G.
