'''Gabriel García Márquez''' ({{IPA-es|ɡaˈβɾjel ɣaɾˈsi.a ˈmaɾkes|am|Es-Gabriel Garcia Marquez.ogg}};{{efn|In isolation, ''García'' is pronounced {{IPA-es|ɡaɾˈsi.a|}}}} 6 March 1927 – 17 April 2014) was a Colombian novelist, short-story writer, screenwriter, and journalist, known affectionately as '''Gabo''' {{IPA-es|ˈɡaβo|}} or '''Gabito''' {{IPA-es|ɡaˈβito|}} throughout Latin America.{{efn|Full name: Gabriel José de la Concordia García Márquez}} Considered one of the most significant authors of the 20th century, particularly in the [[Hispanic literature|Spanish language]], he was awarded the 1972 [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]] and the [[1982 Nobel Prize in Literature]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1982/ | title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1982 |website= NobelPrize.org|publisher= Nobel Media AB 2014|access-date=18 April 2014}}</ref> He pursued a self-directed education that resulted in leaving law school for a career in journalism. From early on he showed no inhibitions in his criticism of Colombian and foreign politics. In 1958 he married [[Mercedes Barcha Pardo]] (d. 2020, aged 87);<ref name=barcha>{{cite web |last1=Osorio |first1=Camila |title=Muere Mercedes Barcha, la mujer que hizo posible el éxito de García Márquez |url=https://elpais.com/cultura/2020-08-15/muere-mercedes-barcha-el-apoyo-mas-grande-que-recibio-gabriel-garcia-marquez.html |website=EL PAÍS |publisher=El Pais |access-date=August 16, 2020 |language=es |date=15 August 2020}}</ref> they had two sons, [[Rodrigo García (director)|Rodrigo]] and Gonzalo.<ref name="muerteBBC" />

García Márquez started as a journalist and wrote many acclaimed non-fiction works and short stories, but is best known for his novels, such as ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'' (1967), ''[[Chronicle of a Death Foretold]]'' (1981), and ''[[Love in the Time of Cholera]]'' (1985). His works have achieved significant critical acclaim and widespread commercial success, most notably for popularizing a literary style known as [[magic realism]], which uses magical elements and events in otherwise ordinary and realistic situations. Some of his works are set in the fictional village of [[Macondo]] (mainly inspired by his birthplace, [[Aracataca]]), and most of them explore the theme of [[solitude]].

Upon García Márquez's death in April 2014, [[Juan Manuel Santos]], the president of Colombia, called him "the greatest Colombian who ever lived."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/apr/19/gabrielgarciamarquez-colombia |title=Gabriel García Márquez: 'The greatest Colombian who ever lived' &#124; Books |last=Vulliamy |first=Ed  |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=2014-04-19 |access-date=2017-07-18}}</ref>

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[File:Aracataca1.jpg|thumb|right|García Márquez billboard in [[Aracataca]]: "I feel Latin American from whatever country, but I have never renounced the nostalgia of my homeland: Aracataca, to which I returned one day and discovered that between reality and nostalgia was the raw material for my work".—Gabriel García Márquez]]

Gabriel García Márquez was born on 6 March 1927{{efn|"On Sunday 6 March 1928, at 9am, in the midst of an unseasonal rainstorm, a baby boy, Gabriel José García Márquez, was born." ({{Harvnb|Martin|2008|p=27}})}} in [[Aracataca]], Colombia, to Gabriel Eligio García and Luisa Santiaga Márquez Iguarán.<ref>{{Harvnb|Martin|2008|p=27}}</ref> Soon after García Márquez was born, his father became a pharmacist and moved, with his wife, to [[Barranquilla]], leaving young Gabriel in Aracataca.<ref>{{Harvnb|Martin|2008|p=30}}</ref> He was raised by his maternal grandparents, Doña Tranquilina Iguarán and Colonel Nicolás Ricardo Márquez Mejía.<ref>{{Harvnb|García Márquez|2003|p=11}}</ref> In December 1936 his father took him and his brother to [[Sincé]], while in March 1937 his grandfather died; the family then moved first (back) to Barranquilla and then on to [[Sucre, Sucre Department|Sucre]], where his father started a pharmacy.<ref>{{Harvnb|Martin|2008|pp=58–66}}</ref>

When his parents fell in love, their relationship met with resistance from Luisa Santiaga Márquez's father, the Colonel. Gabriel Eligio García was not the man the Colonel had envisioned winning the heart of his daughter: Gabriel Eligio was a [[Colombian Conservative Party|Conservative]], and had the reputation of being a womanizer.<ref name = "fcyrqq">{{Harvnb|Saldívar|1997|p=82}}</ref><ref name=GM45>{{Harvnb|García Márquez|2003|p=45}}</ref> Gabriel Eligio wooed Luisa with violin serenades, love poems, countless letters, and even telephone messages after her father sent her away with the intention of separating the young couple. Her parents tried everything to get rid of the man, but he kept coming back, and it was obvious their daughter was committed to him.<ref name = "fcyrqq"/> Her family finally capitulated and gave her permission to marry him<ref>{{Harvnb|Apuleyo Mendoza|García Márquez|1983|pp=11–12}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Saldívar|1997|p=85}}</ref> (The tragicomic story of their courtship would later be adapted and recast as ''[[Love in the Time of Cholera]]''.)<ref name=GM45/><ref>{{Harvnb|Saldívar|1997|p=83}}</ref>

Since García Márquez's parents were more or less strangers to him for the first few years of his life,<ref>{{Harvnb|Saldívar|1997|p=87}}</ref> his grandparents influenced his early development very strongly.<ref name = "mooaza">{{Harvnb|Saldívar|1997|p=102}}</ref><ref name = "Apuleyo96">{{Harvnb|Apuleyo Mendoza|García Márquez|1983|p= 96}}</ref> His grandfather, whom he called "Papalelo",<ref name = "mooaza"/> was a [[Colombian Liberal Party|Liberal]] veteran of the [[Thousand Days War]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Saldívar|1997|p=35}}</ref> The Colonel was considered a hero by Colombian Liberals and was highly respected.<ref>{{Harvnb|Saldívar|1997|p=103}}</ref> He was well known for his refusal to remain silent about the [[banana massacre]]s that took place the year after García Márquez was born.<ref>{{Harvnb|Saldívar|1997|p=105}}</ref> The Colonel, whom García Márquez described as his "umbilical cord with history and reality,"<ref name="simons">{{cite news |last1=Simons |first1=Marlise |title=A Talk With Gabriel García Marquez |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/15/reviews/marquez-talk.html |access-date=24 March 2008 |work=The New York Times |date=5 December 1982}}</ref> was also an excellent storyteller.<ref>{{Harvnb|Saldívar|1997|p=106}}</ref> He taught García Márquez lessons from the dictionary, took him to the circus each year, and was the first to introduce his grandson to ice—a "miracle" found at the [[United Fruit Company]] store.<ref>{{Harvnb|Saldívar|1997|p=104}}</ref> He would also occasionally tell his young grandson "You can't imagine how much a dead man weighs",<ref name = "lydaul">{{Harvnb|Saldívar|1997|p=107}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Apuleyo Mendoza|García Márquez|1983|p=13}}</ref> reminding him that there was no greater burden than to have killed a man, a lesson that García Márquez would later integrate into his novels.

García Márquez's grandmother, Doña Tranquilina Iguarán Cotes, played an influential role in his upbringing. He was inspired by the way she "treated the extraordinary as something perfectly natural."<ref>{{Harvnb|Apuleyo Mendoza|García Márquez|1983|p=12}}</ref> The house was filled with stories of ghosts and premonitions, omens and portents,<ref>{{Harvnb|Saldívar|1997|p=96}}</ref> all of which were studiously ignored by her husband.<ref name = "mooaza"/> According to García Márquez she was "the source of the magical, superstitious and supernatural view of reality".<ref name="simons" /> He enjoyed his grandmother's unique way of telling stories. No matter how fantastic or improbable her statements, she always delivered them as if they were the irrefutable truth. It was a deadpan style that, some thirty years later, heavily influenced her grandson's most popular novel, ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Saldívar|1997|pp=97–98}}</ref>

====Education and adulthood====
After arriving at [[Sucre (Colombia)|Sucre]], it was decided that García Márquez should start his formal education and he was sent to an internship in [[Barranquilla]], a port on the mouth of the [[Río Magdalena]]. There, he gained a reputation of being a timid boy who wrote humorous poems and drew humorous comic strips. Serious and little interested in athletic activities, he was called ''El Viejo'' by his classmates.<ref name="Martin 2008">{{Harvnb|Martin|2008}}</ref>

García Márquez spent his first years of high school, from 1940, in the Colegio [[Compañía de Jesús|jesuita]] San José (today Instituto San José), where he published his first poems in the school magazine ''Juventud''. Later, thanks to a scholarship given to him by the government, Gabriel was sent to study in [[Bogotá]], then was relocated to the Liceo Nacional de [[Zipaquirá]], a town one hour away from the capital, where he would finish his secondary studies.

During his time at the Bogotá study house, he excelled in various sports, becoming team captain of the Liceo Nacional [[Zipaquirá]] team in three disciplines: soccer, baseball, and track.

After his graduation in 1947, García Márquez stayed in Bogotá to study law at the [[Universidad Nacional de Colombia]], but spent most of his spare time reading fiction. ''La metamorfosis'' by [[Franz Kafka]], particularly in the false translation of [[Jorge Luis Borges]],<ref name=PestanaC>{{cite web| url=http://www.ucm.es/info/especulo/numero11/verwandl.html |title=Cristina Pestaña: ¿Quién tradujo por primera vez La metamorfosis al castellano? -nº 11 Espéculo |website=Ucm.es |date=1999|last=Pestaña Castro |first=Cristina|access-date=2017-07-18}}</ref> was a work that especially inspired him. He was excited by the idea of writing, not traditional literature, but in a style similar to his grandmother's stories, in which she "inserted extraordinary events and anomalies as if they were simply an aspect of everyday life." His desire to be a writer grew. A little later he published his first work, "La tercera resignación", which appeared in the 13 September 1947 edition of the newspaper ''El Espectador''.

Though his passion was writing, he continued with law in 1948 to please his father. After the so-called "[[Bogotazo]]" in 1948, some bloody disturbances that happened 9 April caused by the assassination of popular leader [[Jorge Eliécer Gaitán]], the university closed indefinitely and his boarding house was burned. García Márquez transferred to the [[Universidad de Cartagena]] and began working as a reporter of ''[[El Universal (Colombia)|El Universal]]''. In 1950 he ended his legal studies to focus on journalism and moved again to Barranquilla to work as a columnist and reporter in the newspaper ''[[El Heraldo (Barranquilla)|El Heraldo]]''. Though García Márquez never finished his higher studies, some universities, including [[Columbia University]], New York, have given him an honorary doctorate in writing.<ref name="Martin 2008"/>

===Journalism===
García Márquez began his career as a journalist while studying law at the [[National University of Colombia]]. In 1948 and 1949 he wrote for ''[[El Universal (Cartagena)|El Universal]]'' in [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]]. From 1950 until 1952 he wrote a "whimsical" column under the name of "''Septimus''" for the local paper ''[[El Heraldo (Barranquilla)|El Heraldo]]'' in [[Barranquilla]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bell|1993|p=6}}</ref> García Márquez noted of his time at ''El Heraldo'', "I'd write a piece and they'd pay me three pesos for it, and maybe an editorial for another three."<ref>{{Harvnb|Bell-Villada|2006|p= 84}}</ref> During this time he became an active member of the informal group of writers and journalists known as the [[Barranquilla Group]], an association that provided great motivation and inspiration for his literary career. He worked with inspirational figures such as Ramon Vinyes, whom García Márquez depicted as an Old Catalan who owns a bookstore in ''One Hundred Years of Solitude''.<ref name="pelayo5"/> At this time, García Márquez was also introduced to the works of writers such as [[Virginia Woolf]] and [[William Faulkner]]. Faulkner's narrative techniques, historical themes and use of rural locations influenced many Latin American authors.<ref name="Bell7">{{Harvnb|Bell|1993|p= 7}}</ref> The environment of Barranquilla gave García Márquez a world-class literary education and a unique perspective on Caribbean culture. From 1954 to 1955, García Márquez spent time in Bogotá and regularly wrote for Bogotá's ''[[El Espectador]]''. He was a regular film critic.

In December 1957 García Márquez accepted a position in [[Caracas]] with the magazine ''Momento'' directed by  his friend [[Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza]]. He arrived in the Venezuelan capital on 23 December 1957, and began working right away at ''Momento''. García Márquez also witnessed the [[1958 Venezuelan coup d'état]], leading to the exile of the president [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]]. Following this event, García Márquez wrote an article, "The participation of the clergy in the struggle", describing the Church of Venezuela opposition against [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez|Jiménez's]] regime. In March 1958 he made a trip to Colombia, where he married [[Mercedes Barcha]] and together they returned to Caracas. In May 1958, disagreeing with the owner of ''Momento'', he resigned and became shortly afterwards editor of the newspaper ''Venezuela Gráfica''.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

===Politics===
García Márquez was a "committed leftist" throughout his life, adhering to socialist beliefs.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/04/gabriel-garcia-marquez-our-own-brand-of-socialism/|title="Our Own Brand of Socialism": An Interview with Gabriel García Márquez| website=Jacobinmag.com|date=22 April 2014|access-date=2017-07-18}} Gabriel García Márquez on Fidel Castro, the Soviet Union, and creating "a government which would make the poor happy".</ref> In 1991 he published ''Changing the History of Africa'', an admiring study of Cuban activities in the [[Angolan Civil War]] and the larger [[South African Border War]]. He maintained a close but "nuanced" friendship with [[Fidel Castro]], praising the achievements of the [[Cuban Revolution]] but criticizing aspects of governance and working to "soften [the] roughest edges" of the country.<ref>{{cite web|last=Whitney |first=Joel |url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/4/19/gabriel-garcia-marquezfidelcastro.html |title=Gabriel García Márquez and Fidel Castro: A complex and nuanced comraderie &#124; Al Jazeera America |website=America.aljazeera.com |date=2014-04-19 |access-date=2017-07-18}}</ref> García Márquez's political and ideological views were shaped by his grandfather's stories.<ref name = "lydaul"/> In an interview, García Márquez told his friend [[Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza]], "my grandfather the Colonel was a Liberal. My political ideas probably came from him to begin with because, instead of telling me fairy tales when I was young, he would regale me with horrifying accounts of the last civil war that free-thinkers and anti-clerics waged against the Conservative government."<ref name = "Apuleyo96"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Saldívar|1997|p=98}}</ref> This influenced his political views and his literary technique so that "in the same way that his writing career initially took shape in conscious opposition to the Colombian literary status quo, García Márquez's socialist and anti-imperialist views are in principled opposition to the global status quo dominated by the United States."<ref>{{Harvnb|Bell-Villada|1990|p=63}}</ref>

====''The Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor''====
{{Main|The Story of a Shipwrecked Sailor}}
Ending in controversy, his last domestically written editorial for ''El Espectador'' was a series of 14 news articles<ref name="pelayo5">{{Harvnb|Pelayo|2001|p=5}}</ref><ref name="McMurray6">{{Harvnb|McMurray|1987|p=6}}</ref> in which he revealed the hidden story of how a Colombian Navy vessel's shipwreck "occurred because the boat contained a badly stowed cargo of contraband goods that broke loose on the deck."<ref name="McMurray7">{{Harvnb|McMurray|1987|p= 7}}</ref>
García Márquez compiled this story through interviews with a young sailor who survived the wreck.<ref name="McMurray6"/> The articles resulted in public controversy, as they discredited the official account of the events, which had blamed a storm for the shipwreck and glorified the surviving sailor.

In response to this controversy ''El Espectador'' sent García Márquez away to Europe to be a foreign correspondent.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pelayo|2001|p=6}}</ref> He wrote about his experiences for ''El Independiente'', a newspaper that briefly replaced ''El Espectador'' during the military government of General [[Gustavo Rojas Pinilla]]<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/biografias/lleralbe.htm
|title=Lleras Camargo, Alberto|publisher=Biblioteca Luis Ángel Arango|access-date=2 December 2008|language=es}}</ref> and was later shut down by Colombian authorities.<ref name="Bell7"/> García Márquez's background in journalism provided a foundational base for his writing career. Literary critic Bell-Villada noted, "Owing to his hands-on experiences in journalism, García Márquez is, of all the great living authors, the one who is closest to everyday reality."<ref>{{Harvnb|Bell-Villada|1990|p=62}}</ref>

===QAP===
García Márquez was one of the original founders of [[QAP (Colombia)|QAP]], a Colombian newscast that aired between 1992 and 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-711688 |title=LA ÚLTIMA EMISIÓN DE QAP – Archivo Digital de Noticias de Colombia y el Mundo desde 1.990 |website=Eltiempo.com |date=1997-12-30 |access-date=2017-07-18}}</ref> He was attracted to the project by the promise of editorial and journalistic independence.

===Marriage and family===
García Márquez met Mercedes Barcha while she was at school; he was 12 and she was nine.<ref name=barcha />  When he was sent to Europe as a foreign correspondent, Mercedes waited for him to return to Barranquilla. Finally they married in 1958.<ref name="saldívar372">{{Harvnb|Saldívar|1997|p=372}}</ref><ref name="pelayo7">{{Harvnb|Pelayo|2001|p=7}}</ref> The following year, their first son, [[Rodrigo García (director)|Rodrigo García]], now a television and film director, was born.<ref name="pelayo7"/> In 1961, the family traveled by [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] bus throughout the southern United States and eventually settled in [[Mexico City]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Bell-Villada|2006|pp=xx–xxi}}</ref> García Márquez had always wanted to see the Southern United States because it inspired the writings of [[William Faulkner]].<ref name="pelayo8">{{Harvnb|Pelayo|2001|p=8}}</ref> Three years later the couple's second son, Gonzalo, was born in Mexico.<ref name=bell-villadaxxi>{{Harvnb|Bell-Villada|2006|p=xxi}}</ref> Gonzalo is currently a graphic designer in Mexico City.<ref name="pelayo8"/>

===''Leaf Storm''===
{{Main|Leaf Storm}}

''Leaf Storm'' (''La Hojarasca'') is García Márquez's first novella and took seven years to find a publisher, finally being published in 1955.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/rguides/us/of_love_and_other_demons.html |title=Of love and other demons |publisher=Penguin Group |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629091255/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/rguides/us/of_love_and_other_demons.html |archive-date=29 June 2008 }}</ref> García Márquez notes that "of all that he had written (as of 1973), ''Leaf Storm'' was his favorite because he felt that it was the most sincere and spontaneous."<ref>{{Harvnb|Pelayo|2001|p=28}}</ref> All the events of the novella take place in one room, during a half-hour period on Wednesday 12 September 1928. It is the story of an old colonel (similar to García Márquez's own grandfather) who tries to give a proper Christian burial to an unpopular French doctor. The colonel is supported only by his daughter and grandson. The novella explores the child's first experience with death by following his stream of consciousness. The book also reveals the perspective of Isabel, the Colonel's daughter, which provides a feminine point of view.<ref name="pelayo5"/>

===''In Evil Hour''===
{{Main|In Evil Hour}}
''In Evil Hour'' (''La mala hora'') is García Márquez's second novel first published in 1962. At first this novel was originally entitled Este pueblo de mierda (This Town of Shit or This Shitty Town). Some of the same characters and situations found in ''In Evil Hour'' later re-appear in ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]''.

===''One Hundred Years of Solitude''===
{{Main|One Hundred Years of Solitude}}

Since 18, García Márquez had wanted to write a novel based on his grandparents' house where he grew up. However, he struggled with finding an appropriate tone and put off the idea until one day the answer hit him while driving his family to [[Acapulco]].  He turned the car around and the family returned home so he could begin writing.  He sold his car so his family would have money to live on while he wrote, but writing the novel took far longer than he expected, and he wrote every day for 18 months. His wife had to ask for food on credit from their butcher and their baker as well as nine months of rent on credit from their landlord.<ref>{{Harvnb|Apuleyo Mendoza|García Márquez|1983|pp=74–75}}</ref> During the 18 months of writing, García Márquez met with two couples, Eran Carmen and [[Álvaro Mutis]], and [[María Luisa Elío]] and [[Jomí García Ascot]], every night and discussed the progress of the novel, trying out different versions.<ref name="Jaime (2014)">{{cite web|last1=Jaime|first1=Victor Nunez|title=María Luisa Elío, la destinataria de Cien años de soledad|url=http://blogs.elpais.com/periodista-en-serie/2014/04/mar%C3%ADa-luisa-el%C3%ADo-la-destinataria-de-cien-a%C3%B1os-de-soledad.html|website=El País|access-date=15 April 2015|location=Madrid, Spain|language=es|date=21 April 2014}}</ref> When the book was finally published in 1967, it became his most commercially successful novel, ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' (''Cien años de soledad''; English translation by [[Gregory Rabassa]], 1970), which sold more than 30 million copies<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-27076562 |title=BBC News – Tributes pour in for Colombian author Gabriel Garcia Marquez |publisher=Bbc.com |date=2014-04-18 |access-date=2014-04-24}}</ref> and was dedicated "Para (to) Jomí García Ascot y María Luisa Elío."<ref name="Jaime (2014)" /> The story chronicles several generations of the Buendía family from the time they founded the fictional South American village of [[Macondo]], through their trials and tribulations, instances of incest, births and deaths. The history of Macondo is often generalized by critics to represent rural towns throughout Latin America or at least near García Márquez's native [[Aracataca]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Pelayo|2001|p=97}}</ref><ref name = "xqsoal">{{Harvnb|Apuleyo Mendoza|García Márquez|1983|p=72}}</ref>

This novel was widely popular and led to García Márquez's Nobel Prize as well as the [[Rómulo Gallegos Prize]] in 1972. [[William Kennedy (author)|William Kennedy]] has called it "the first piece of literature since the [[Book of Genesis]] that should be required reading for the entire human race,"<ref>{{Citation|url=https://archive.org/details/approachestoteac0000unse_g3b6|title=One Hundred Years of Solitude|author=García Márquez|year=1990|isbn=978-0-87352-535-0|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|url-access=registration}}</ref> and hundreds of articles and books of literary critique have been published in response to it. Despite the many accolades the book received, García Márquez tended to downplay its success. He once remarked: "Most critics don't realize that a novel like ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' is a bit of a joke, full of signals to close friends; and so, with some pre-ordained right to pontificate they take on the responsibility of decoding the book and risk making terrible fools of themselves."<ref name = "xqsoal"/>

===Fame===
[[File:Gabogarciamarquez1.png|thumb|right|upright|García Márquez signing a copy of ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'' in [[Havana]], Cuba]]
After writing ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' García Márquez returned to Europe, this time bringing along his family, to live in [[Barcelona]], Spain, for seven years.<ref name=bell-villadaxxi/> The international recognition García Márquez earned with the publication of the novel led to his ability to act as a facilitator in several negotiations between the [[Government of Colombia|Colombian government]] and the guerrillas, including the former [[19th of April Movement]] (M-19), and the current [[FARC]] and [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]] organizations.<ref>{{Citation|author=Vargas, Alejo| url=http://www.elcolombiano.com.co/BancoConocimiento/G/gabriel_garcia_marquez_y_la_paz_colombiana/gabriel_garcia_marquez_y_la_paz_colombiana.asp?CodSeccion=46|title=Gabriel García Márquez y la paz colombiana.|publisher=ElColombiano.com|access-date=5 February 2008|language=es}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/latin_america/newsid_6444000/6444281.stm|title=García Márquez media por la paz|publisher=BBC Mundo|date=13 March 2007|access-date=5 February 2008|language=es}}</ref> The popularity of his writing also led to friendships with powerful leaders, including one with former Cuban president [[Fidel Castro]], which has been analyzed in ''Gabo and Fidel: Portrait of a Friendship.''<ref>{{Harvnb|Esteban|Panichelli|2004}}</ref> It was during this time that he was punched in the face by [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] in what became one of the largest feuds in modern literature. In an interview with [[Claudia Dreifus]] in 1982 García Márquez notes his relationship with Castro is mostly based on literature: "Ours is an intellectual friendship. It may not be widely known that Fidel is a very cultured man. When we’re together, we talk a great deal about literature."<ref>{{Harvnb|Bell-Villada|2006|p=100}}</ref> This relationship was criticized by [[Cuban exile]] writer [[Reinaldo Arenas]], in his 1992 memoir ''Antes de que Anochezca'' (''[[Before Night Falls]]'').<ref>{{Harvnb|Arenas|1993|p=278}}</ref>

Due to his newfound fame and his outspoken views on [[American imperialism|US imperialism]], Garcia Márquez was labeled as a subversive and for many years was denied visas by US immigration authorities.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bell-Villada|1990|p=67}}</ref> After [[Bill Clinton]] was elected US president, he lifted the travel ban and cited ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' as his favorite novel.<ref name=bell-villadaxxii/>

===''Autumn of the Patriarch''===
{{Main|Autumn of the Patriarch}}

García Márquez was inspired to write a [[dictator novel]] when he witnessed the flight of Venezuelan dictator [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]]. He said, "it was the first time we had seen a dictator fall in Latin America."<ref>{{Harvnb|Apuleyo Mendoza|García Márquez|1983|p=81}}</ref> García Márquez began writing ''Autumn of the Patriarch'' (''El otoño del patriarca'') in 1968 and said it was finished in 1971; however, he continued to embellish the [[dictator novel]] until 1975 when it was published in Spain.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=William |title=A Stunning Portrait of a Monstrous Caribbean Tyrant |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/06/15/reviews/marque-autumn.html |access-date=24 March 2008 |work=The New York Times |date=31 October 1976}}</ref> According to García Márquez, the novel is a "poem on the solitude of power" as it follows the life of an eternal dictator known as the General. The novel is developed through a series of anecdotes related to the life of the General, which do not appear in chronological order.<ref name=williams112>{{Harvnb|Williams|1984|p= 112}}</ref> Although the exact location of the story is not pin-pointed in the novel, the imaginary country is situated somewhere in the Caribbean.<ref name=Williams111>{{Harvnb|Williams|1984|p=111}}</ref>

García Márquez gave his own explanation of the plot:

<blockquote>My intention was always to make a synthesis of all the Latin American dictators, but especially those from the Caribbean. Nevertheless, the personality of Juan Vicente Gomez [of Venezuela] was so strong, in addition to the fact that he exercised a special fascination over me, that undoubtedly the Patriarch has much more of him than anyone else.<ref name=Williams111/></blockquote>

After ''Autumn of the Patriarch'' was published García Márquez and his family moved from Barcelona to [[Mexico City]]<ref name=bell-villadaxxi/> and García Márquez pledged not to publish again until the Chilean Dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]] was deposed. But he ultimately published ''Chronicle of a Death Foretold'' while Pinochet was still in power, as he "could not remain silent in the face of injustice and repression."<ref name="Maurya58">{{Harvnb|Maurya|1983|p=58}}</ref>

===''The Incredible and Sad Tale of Innocent Eréndira and Her Heartless Grandmother''===
{{Main|The Incredible and Sad Tale of Innocent Eréndira and Her Heartless Grandmother}}

''The Incredible and Sad Tale of Innocent Eréndira and Her Heartless Grandmother'' ({{lang-es|La increíble y triste historia de la cándida Eréndira y de su abuela desalmada}}) presents the story of a young mulatto girl who dreams of freedom, but cannot escape the reach of her avaricious grandmother.

The plot of the novella describes the life journey of 14-year-old Eréndira, who is living with her grandmother when she accidentally sets fire to their home. The grandmother forces Eréndira to repay the debt by becoming a prostitute as they travel the road as vagrants. Men line up to enjoy Eréndira's services. She eventually escapes with the assistance of her affectionate and somewhat gullible lover, Ulises, but only after he murders her grandmother. After the murder, Eréndira runs off into the night alone, leaving him in the tent with the dead body of her grandmother.

Eréndira and her grandmother make an appearance in ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'', an earlier novel by García Márquez.

''The Incredible and Sad Tale of Innocent Eréndira and Her Heartless Grandmother'' was published in 1978. The novella was adapted to the [[1983 in film|1983]] art film ''[[Eréndira (film)|Eréndira]]'', directed by [[Ruy Guerra]].

===''Chronicle of a Death Foretold''===
{{Main|Chronicle of a Death Foretold}}

''Chronicle of a Death Foretold'' (''Crónica de una muerte anunciada''), which literary critic Ruben Pelayo called a combination of journalism, realism and detective story,<ref>{{Harvnb|Pelayo|2001|p=115}}</ref> is inspired by a real-life murder that took place in [[Sucre, Colombia|Sucre]], Colombia, in 1951, but García Márquez maintained that nothing of the actual events remains beyond the point of departure and the structure.<ref>''An Interview with Gabriel García Márquez'', in Murray, Glen (ed.), ''[[Cencrastus]]'' No. 7, Winter 1981–82, pp. 6 & 7.</ref> The character of Santiago Nasar is based on a  good friend from García Márquez's childhood, Cayetano Gentile Chimento.<ref name="pelayo111">{{Harvnb|Pelayo|2001|p=111}}</ref>

The plot of the novel revolves around Santiago Nasar's murder. The narrator acts as a detective, uncovering the events of the murder as the novel proceeds.<ref name="pelayo112">{{Harvnb|Pelayo|2001|p=112}}</ref> Pelayo notes that the story "unfolds in an inverted fashion. Instead of moving forward... the plot moves backward."<ref>{{Harvnb|Pelayo|2001|p=113}}</ref>

''Chronicle of a Death Foretold'' was published in 1981, the year before García Márquez was awarded the 1982 Nobel Prize in Literature.<ref name="pelayo111"/> The novel was also adapted into a film by Italian director [[Francesco Rosi]] in 1987.<ref name="pelayo112"/>

===''Love in the Time of Cholera''===
{{Main|Love in the Time of Cholera}}

''Love in the Time of Cholera'' (''El amor en los tiempos del cólera'') was first published in 1985. It is considered a non-traditional love story as "lovers find love in their 'golden years'—in their seventies, when death is all around them".<ref>{{Harvnb|Pelayo|2001|p=11}}</ref>

''Love in the Time of Cholera'' is based on the stories of two couples. The young love of Fermina Daza and Florentino Ariza is based on the love affair of García Márquez's parents.<ref name=bell-villada156>{{Harvnb|Bell-Villada|2006|p=156}}</ref> But as García Márquez explained in an interview: "The only difference is [my parents] married. And as soon as they were married, they were no longer interesting as literary figures."<ref name=bell-villada156/> The love of old people is based on a newspaper story about the death of two Americans, who were almost 80 years old, who met every year in Acapulco. They were out in a boat one day and were murdered by the boatman with his oars. García Márquez notes, "Through their death, the story of their secret romance became known. I was fascinated by them. They were each married to other people."<ref>{{Harvnb|Bell-Villada|2006|p=157}}</ref>

===''News of a Kidnapping''===
{{Main|News of a Kidnapping}}

''News of a Kidnapping'' (''Noticia de un secuestro'') was first published in 1996. It is a non-fiction book that examines a series of related [[kidnapping]]s and [[narcoterrorist]] actions committed in the early 1990s in Colombia by the [[Medellín Cartel]], a drug cartel founded and operated by [[Pablo Escobar]]. The text recounts the kidnapping, imprisonment, and eventual release of prominent figures in Colombia, including politicians and members of the press.
The original idea of the book was proposed to García Márquez by the former minister for education [[Maruja Pachón Castro]] and Colombian diplomat [[Luis Alberto Villamizar Cárdenas]], both of whom were among the many victims of Pablo Escobar's attempt to pressure the government to stop his [[extradition]] by committing a series of kidnappings, murders and terrorist actions.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.semana.com/enfoque/articulo/maruja-pachon-ex-ministra-educacion/103434-3|title=Maruja Pachón, ex ministra de Educación|work=Semana|date=23 May 2009}}</ref>

===''Living to Tell the Tale'' and ''Memories of My Melancholy Whores''===
In 2002 García Márquez published the memoir ''Vivir para contarla'', the first of a projected three-volume autobiography. [[Edith Grossman]]'s English translation, ''[[Living to Tell the Tale]]'', was published in November 2003.<ref>{{Harvnb|García Márquez|2003}}</ref> October 2004 brought the publication of a novel, ''[[Memories of My Melancholy Whores]]'' (''Memoria de mis putas tristes''), a love story that follows the romance of a 90-year-old man and a child forced into prostitution. ''Memories of My Melancholy Whores'' caused controversy in Iran, where it was banned after an initial 5,000 copies were printed and sold.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Sarkouhi| first=Faraj|title=Iran: Book Censorship The Rule, Not The Exception|newspaper= Payvands' Iran News|date=26 November 2007|access-date=29 March 2008|url= http://www.payvand.com/news/07/nov/1244.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Ron |first=Jesus |title=Mayhem in Paris, author banned from Iran, Chavez at odds w/ Colombia & Spain |newspaper=Rutgers Observer |date=4 December 2007 |access-date=29 March 2008 |url=http://media.www.rutgersobserver.com/media/storage/paper822/news/2007/12/04/News/Mayhem.In.Paris.Author.Banned.From.Iran.Chavez.At.Odds.W.Colombia.Spain-3129071.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071213145001/http://media.www.rutgersobserver.com/media/storage/paper822/news/2007/12/04/News/Mayhem.In.Paris.Author.Banned.From.Iran.Chavez.At.Odds.W.Colombia.Spain-3129071.shtml |archive-date=13 December 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref>

===Film and opera===
[[File:Gabriel Garcia Marquez (2009).jpg|thumb|García Márquez with the Colombian Culture Minister [[Paula Marcela Moreno Zapata|Paula Moreno]] (left) at the [[Guadalajara International Film Festival]], in Guadalajara, Mexico, in March 2009]]
Critics often describe the language that García Márquez's imagination produces as visual or graphic,<ref name="Stavans65">{{Harvnb|Stavans|1993|p= 65}}</ref> and he himself explains each of his stories is inspired by "a visual image,"<ref>{{Harvnb|Apuleyo Mendoza|García Márquez|1983|p=26}}</ref> so it comes as no surprise that he had a long and involved history with film. He was a film critic, he founded and served as executive director of the Film Institute in Havana,<ref name="Stavans65"/> was the head of the Latin American Film Foundation, and wrote several screenplays.<ref name="Bell7"/> For his first script he worked with [[Carlos Fuentes]] on Juan Rulfo's ''El gallo de oro''.<ref name="Stavans65"/> His other screenplays include the films ''[[A Time to Die (1985 film)|Tiempo de morir]]'' (1966), (1985) and ''[[Un señor muy viejo con unas alas enormes]]'' (1988), as well as the television series ''Amores difíciles'' (1991).<ref name="Stavans65"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Gonzales|1994|p=43}}</ref>

García Márquez also originally wrote his ''Eréndira'' as a third screenplay. However, this version was lost and replaced by the novella. Nonetheless, he worked on rewriting the script in collaboration with [[Ruy Guerra]] and the film was released in Mexico in 1983.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Aufderheide|first= Patricia |title=Cross-cultural film guide |publisher=American University Library |url=http://www.library.american.edu/subject/media/aufderheide/erendira.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219053141/http://www.library.american.edu/subject/media/aufderheide/erendira.html |archive-date=19 December 2007 }}</ref>

Several of his stories have inspired other writers and directors. In 1987, the Italian director [[Francesco Rosi]] directed the movie ''[[Chronicle of a Death Foretold (film)|Cronaca di una morte annunciata]]'' based on ''Chronicle of a Death Foretold''.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gonzales|1994|p=33}}</ref> Several film adaptations have been made in Mexico, including [[Miguel Littín]]'s ''La Viuda de Montiel'' (1979), Jaime Humberto Hermosillo's ''Maria de mi corazón'' (1979),<ref>{{Harvnb|Mraz|1994}}</ref> and Arturo Ripstein's ''El coronel no tiene quien le escriba'' (1998).<ref>{{Harvnb|de la Mora|Ripstein|1999|p=5}}</ref>

British director [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]] (''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'') filmed ''[[Love in the Time of Cholera (film)|Love in the Time of Cholera]]'' in [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]], Colombia, with the screenplay written by Ronald Harwood (''[[The Pianist (2002 film)|The Pianist]]''). The film was released in the U.S. on 16 November 2007.<ref>{{cite web|last=Douglas|first=Edward|title=Mike Newell on Love in the Time of Cholera|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=39181|website=comingsoon.net|date=12 November 2007| access-date=25 March 2008}}</ref>

His novel ''Of Love and Other Demons'' was adapted and directed by a Costa Rican filmmaker, Hilda Hidalgo, who is a graduate of the Film Institute at Havana where García Márquez would frequently impart screenplay workshops. Hidalgo's film was released in April 2010. The same novel was adapted by Hungarian composer [[Péter Eötvös]] to form the opera ''[[Love and Other Demons]]'', premiered in 2008 at [[Glyndebourne Festival]].

===Later life and death===

====Declining health====
In 1999 García Márquez was misdiagnosed with pneumonia instead of [[lymphatic cancer]].<ref name=bell-villadaxxii>{{Harvnb|Bell-Villada|2006| p= xxii}}</ref> Chemotherapy at a hospital in Los Angeles proved to be successful, and the illness went into remission.<ref name=bell-villadaxxii/><ref name="Forero">{{cite news |last1=Forero |first1=Juan |title=A Storyteller Tells His Own Story; García Márquez, Fighting Cancer, Issues Memoirs |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507EEDC113BF93AA35753C1A9649C8B63 |access-date=21 March 2008 |work=The New York Times |date=9 October 2002}}</ref> This event prompted García Márquez to begin writing his memoirs: "I reduced relations with my friends to a minimum, disconnected the telephone, canceled the trips and all sorts of current and future plans", he told ''[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]'', the Colombian newspaper, "and locked myself in to write every day without interruption."<ref name="Forero"/> In 2002, three years later, he published ''[[Living to Tell the Tale]]'' (''Vivir para Contarla''), the first volume in a projected trilogy of memoirs.<ref name="Forero"/>

In 2000 his impending death was incorrectly reported by Peruvian daily newspaper ''[[La República]]''. The next day other newspapers republished his alleged farewell poem, "La Marioneta," but shortly afterward García Márquez denied being the author of the poem, which was determined to be the work of a Mexican ventriloquist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://elpais.com/diario/2000/06/01/cultura/959810408_850215.html|title=García Márquez: 'Lo que me puede matar es que alguien crea que escribí una cosa tan cursi.'|newspaper=El País|date= 31 May 2000|access-date=10 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/EDICIONESANTERIORES/2000/JUNIO/junio2/ESCENARIOS/escen3.html|title=García Márquez: "Lo que me mata es que crean que escribo así"|publisher=Elsalvador.com|access-date=26 March 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512085850/http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/EDICIONESANTERIORES/2000/JUNIO/junio2/ESCENARIOS/escen3.html|archive-date=12 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Boese|first=Alex|date=2002|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/marquez.html|title=García Márquez Farewell Letter|publisher=Museum of Hoaxes|access-date=26 March 2008}}</ref>

García Márquez was cremated at a private family ceremony in Mexico City.

==Style==
[[File:Gabriel Garcia Marquez 1984.jpg|thumb|upright|"Gabo" wearing a "''[[sombrero vueltiao]]''" hat, typical of the [[Caribbean Region of Colombia|Colombian Caribbean region]]. Most of the stories by García Márquez revolve around the idiosyncrasy of this region.]]

<blockquote>In every book I try to make a different path ... . One doesn't choose the style. You can investigate and try to discover what the best style would be for a theme. But the style is determined by the subject, by the mood of the times. If you try to use something that is not suitable, it just won't work. Then the critics build theories around that and they see things I hadn't seen. I only respond to our way of life, the life of the Caribbean.<ref>{{cite news|last= Simons |first= Marlise |title= Gabriel Márquez on Love, Plagues and Politics |newspaper= The New York Times |date= 21 February 1988 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1988/02/21/books/gabriel-marquez-on-love-plagues-and-politics.html |access-date= 30 July 2008 }}</ref></blockquote>

García Márquez was noted for leaving out seemingly important details and events so the reader is forced into a more participatory role in the story development. For example, in ''[[No One Writes to the Colonel]]'', the main characters are not given names. This practice is influenced by Greek tragedies, such as ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'' and ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', in which important events occur off-stage and are left to the audience's imagination.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bell-Villada|1990|p= 75}}</ref>

===Realism and magical realism===
Reality is an important theme in all of García Márquez's works. He said of his early works (with the exception of ''Leaf Storm''), "''Nobody Writes to the Colonel'', ''In Evil Hour'', and ''Big Mama's Funeral'' all reflect the reality of life in Colombia and this theme determines the rational structure of the books. I don't regret having written them, but they belong to a kind of premeditated literature that offers too static and exclusive a vision of reality."<ref>{{Harvnb|Apuleyo Mendoza|García Márquez|1983|p=56}}</ref>

In his other works he experimented more with less traditional approaches to reality, so that "the most frightful, the most unusual things are told with the deadpan expression".<ref>{{Harvnb|McMurray|1987|p=18}}</ref> A commonly cited example is the physical and spiritual ascending into heaven of a character while she is hanging the laundry out to dry in ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]].'' The style of these works fits in the "marvellous realm" described by the Cuban writer [[Alejo Carpentier]] and was labeled as [[magical realism]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Maurya|1983|p=57}}</ref> Literary critic Michael Bell proposes an alternative understanding for García Márquez's style, as the category magic realism is criticized for being dichotomizing and exoticizing, "what is really at stake is a psychological suppleness which is able to inhabit unsentimentally the daytime world while remaining open to the promptings of those domains which modern culture has, by its own inner logic, necessarily marginalised or repressed."<ref>{{Harvnb|Bell|1993|p=49}}</ref> García Márquez and his friend Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza discuss his work in a similar way,

<blockquote>The way you treat reality in your books ... has been called magical realism. I have the feeling your European readers are usually aware of the magic of your stories but fail to see the reality behind it .... This is surely because their rationalism prevents them seeing that reality isn't limited to the price of tomatoes and eggs.<ref>{{Harvnb|Apuleyo Mendoza|García Márquez|1983|p=35}}</ref></blockquote>

==Themes==
===Solitude===
The theme of solitude runs through much of García Márquez's works. As Pelayo notes, "''Love in the Time of Cholera'', like all of Gabriel García Márquez's work, explores the solitude of the individual and of humankind...portrayed through the solitude of love and of being in love".<ref>{{Harvnb|Pelayo|2001|p=136}}</ref>

In response to Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza's question, "If solitude is the theme of all your books, where should we look for the roots of this over-riding emotion?  In your childhood perhaps?" García Márquez replied, "I think it's a problem everybody has. Everyone has his own way and means of expressing it. The feeling pervades the work of so many writers, although some of them may express it unconsciously."<ref>{{Harvnb|Apuleyo Mendoza|García Márquez|1983|p=54}}</ref>

In his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, ''[[Solitude of Latin America]]'', he relates this theme of solitude to the Latin American experience, "The interpretation of our reality through patterns not our own, serves only to make us ever more unknown, ever less free, ever more solitary."<ref>{{Harvnb|García Márquez|1982}}</ref>

===Macondo===
Another important theme in many of García Márquez's work is the setting of the village he calls [[Macondo]]. He uses his home town of Aracataca, Colombia as a cultural, historical and geographical reference to create this imaginary town, but the representation of the village is not limited to this specific area. García Márquez shares, "Macondo is not so much a place as a state of mind, which allows you to see what you want, and how you want to see it."<ref>{{Harvnb|Apuleyo Mendoza| García Márquez|1983|p=77}}</ref> Even when his stories do not take place in Macondo, there is often still a consistent lack of specificity to the location. So while they are often set with "a Caribbean coastline and an Andean hinterland... [the settings are] otherwise unspecified, in accordance with García Márquez's evident attempt to capture a more general regional myth rather than give a specific political analysis."<ref>{{Harvnb|Bell|1993|p=70}}</ref> This fictional town has become well known in the literary world. As Stavans notes of Macondo, "its geography and inhabitants constantly invoked by teachers, politicians, and tourist agents..." makes it  "...hard to believe it is a sheer fabrication."<ref>{{Harvnb|Stavans|1993|p= 58}}</ref> In ''Leaf Storm'' García Márquez depicts the realities of the ''Banana Boom'' in Macondo, which include a period of great wealth during the presence of the US companies and a period of depression upon the departure of the American banana companies.<ref>{{Harvnb|McMurray|1987|p=15}}</ref> As well, ''One Hundred Years of Solitude'' takes place in Macondo and tells the complete history of the fictional town from its founding to its doom.<ref>{{Harvnb|McMurray|1987|p= 17}}</ref>

In his autobiography, García Márquez explains his fascination with the word and concept Macondo. He describes a trip he made with his mother back to Aracataca as a young man:<blockquote>

The train stopped at a station that had no town, and a short while later it passed the only banana plantation along the route that had its name written over the gate: ''Macondo''. This word had attracted my attention ever since the first trips I had made with my grandfather, but I discovered only as an adult that I liked its poetic resonance. I never heard anyone say it and did not even ask myself what it meant...I happened to read in an encyclopedia that it is a tropical tree resembling the [[Ceiba]].<ref>{{Harvnb|García Márquez|2003|p= 19}}</ref></blockquote>

===La Violencia===
In several of García Márquez's works, including ''No One Writes to the Colonel'', ''In Evil Hour'', and ''Leaf Storm'', he referenced ''[[La Violencia]]'' (the violence), "a brutal civil war between conservatives and liberals that lasted into the 1960s, causing the deaths of several hundred thousand Colombians".<ref name="McMurray6"/><ref name=pelayo43>{{Harvnb|Pelayo|2001|p=43}}</ref> Throughout all of his novels there are subtle references to ''la violencia''. For example, characters live under various unjust situations like curfew, press censorship, and underground newspapers.<ref name="McMurray16">{{Harvnb|McMurray|1987|p=16}}</ref> ''In Evil Hour'', while not one of García Márquez's most famous novels, is notable for its portrayal of ''la violencia'' with its "fragmented portrayal of social disintegration provoked by ''la violencia''".<ref>{{Harvnb|McMurray|1987|p=25}}</ref> Although García Márquez did portray the corrupt nature and the injustices of times like ''la violencia'', he refused to use his work as a platform for political propaganda. "For him, the duty of the revolutionary writer is to write well, and the ideal novel is one that moves its reader by its political and social content, and, at the same time, by its power to penetrate reality and expose its other side.<ref name="McMurray16"/>

==Legacy==
{{quote|Whether in fiction or nonfiction, in the epic novel or the concentrated story, Márquez is now recognized in the words of [[Carlos Fuentes]] as "the most popular and perhaps the best writer in Spanish since [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]]". He is one of those very rare artists who succeed in chronicling not only a nation's life, culture and history, but also those of an entire continent, and a master storyteller who, as ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'' once said, "forces upon us at every page the wonder and extravagance of life."<ref name = "PSinsights">''One Hundred years of Solitude'', by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, 2003, Harper Collins: New York, {{ISBN|978-0-06-088328-7}}, post-script section entitled: 'P.S. Insights, Interviews & More' pgs 2–12</ref>}}

García Márquez's work is an important part of the [[Latin American Boom]] of literature.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bacon|2001|p= 833}}</ref> His work has challenged critics of Colombian literature to step out of the conservative criticism that had been dominant before the success of ''One Hundred Years of Solitude''.  In a review of literary criticism Robert Sims notes,

{{quote|text=García Márquez continues to cast a lengthy shadow in Colombia, Latin America, and the United States.  Critical works on the 1982 Nobel laureate have reached industrial proportion and show no signs of abating. Moreover, García Márquez has galvanized Colombian literature in an unprecedented way by giving a tremendous impetus to Colombian literature.  Indeed, he has become a touchstone for literature and criticism throughout the Americas as his work has created a certain attraction-repulsion among critics and writers while readers continue to devour new publications.  No one can deny that García Márquez has helped rejuvenate, reformulate, and recontextualize literature and criticism in Colombia and the rest of Latin America.<ref>{{Harvnb|Sims|1994|p=224}}</ref>}}

Following his death, García Márquez's family made the decision to deposit his papers and some of his personal effects at The University of Texas at Austin's [[Harry Ransom Center]], a humanities research library and museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrc.utexas.edu/press/releases/2015/gabriel-garcia-marquez-archive.html |title=Gabriel García Márquez Archive Opens for Research on October 21 |website=www.hrc.utexas.edu |access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last1=Schuessler |first1=Jennifer |title=Gabriel García Márquez's Archive Freely Available Online |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2018-04-02 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/arts/gabriel-garcia-marquez-archive-online.html |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Nobel Prize===
{{Main|1982 Nobel Prize in Literature}}

García Márquez received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] on 10 December 1982 "for his novels and short stories, in which the fantastic and the realistic are combined in a richly composed world of imagination, reflecting a continent's life and conflicts".  His acceptance speech was entitled  "[[The Solitude of Latin America]]".<ref>{{Harvnb|García Márquez|1982}}, see {{Harvnb|Pelayo|2001|p=11}}</ref> García Márquez was the first Colombian and fourth Latin American to win a Nobel Prize for Literature.<ref>{{Harvnb|Maurya|1983|p=53}}</ref> After becoming a Nobel laureate, García Márquez stated to a correspondent: "I have the impression that in giving me the prize, they have taken into account the literature of the sub-continent and have awarded me as a way of awarding all of this literature".<ref name="Maurya58"/>
