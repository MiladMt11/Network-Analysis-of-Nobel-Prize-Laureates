{{Nihongo|'''Satoshi Ōmura''' [[Help:IPA for Japanese|[satoɕi oːmu͍ɽa]]]|大村 智|Ōmura Satoshi|extra=born 12 July 1935}} is a Japanese [[biochemist]]. He is known for the discovery and development of hundreds of [[pharmaceuticals]] originally occurring in [[microorganism]]s. In 2015, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] jointly with [[William C. Campbell (scientist)|William C. Campbell]] for their role in the discovery of [[avermectins]] and [[ivermectin]],<ref name="npoab">{{cite news |title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2015 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2015/press-release/ |publisher=Nobel Prize Outreach AB |date=6 October 2015}}</ref> the world's first [[endectocide]] and a safe and highly effective [[microfilaricide]].<ref name=omura11/> It is believed that the large molecular size of ivemectin prevents it from crossing the blood/[[aqueous humour]] barrier, and renders the drug an important treatment of [[helminth]]ically-derived blindness.

== Early life and education ==
Satoshi Ōmura was born in [[Nirasaki, Yamanashi]] Japan in 1935, the second son of Ōmura family. After graduating from the [[University of Yamanashi]] in 1958, he was appointed to science teacher at [[:ja:東京都立墨田工業高等学校|Tokyo Metropolitan Sumida Tech High School]]. In 1960, he became an auditor of [[Koji Nakanishi]]’s course at [[Tokyo University of Education]], one year later, he enrolled in the [[Tokyo University of Science]] (TUS) and studied sciences. Ōmura received his M.S. degree from TUS and his [[Ph.D.]] in Pharmaceutical Sciences from the [[University of Tokyo]] (1968, a Dissertation PhD) and a Ph.D. in [[Chemistry]] at TUS (1970).<ref name=Gairdner />

== Career ==
Since 1965 Ōmura served at [[Kitasato Institute]] system.<ref name="kitasato2012">[http://www.kitasato.ac.jp/new_news/n20121101.html 大村智北里研究所顧問・北里大学名誉教授が文化功労者に] 北里大学 2012年11月1日</ref> From 1970 to 1990, he also became a part-time lecturer at [[Tokyo University of Science]].<ref>[http://www.tus.ac.jp/today/archive/20151218001.html [from ストックホルム]「これからは人材の育成に努力します」大村先生が語った受賞後の活動]TUSToday 2015.12.18</ref>

In 1971 while he was a visiting professor at [[Wesleyan University]],<ref name="kitasato2012"/> he consulted the chairman of the [[American Chemical Society]], [[Max Tishler]], at an international conference. Together they successfully acquired research expenses from [[Merck & Co.]].<ref name="hakken">「人間発見」日本経済新聞2010年7月14日</ref> Ōmura was considering continuing his research in the United States, but ultimately he decided to return to Japan.

In 1973, he became a director of the antibiotic laboratory at [[Kitasato University]],<ref>[http://www.sankei.com/life/print/151005/lif1510050066-c.html 「【ノーベル賞受賞】大村智氏、常識破りの発想で治療薬開発 」] 産経ニュース2015.10.5</ref> and he also started collaborative research with Merck & Co.<ref name="JT-BRH-SCIENTISTWEB">[https://www.brh.co.jp/s_library/j_site/scientistweb/no84/ 「 新しい微生物創薬の世界を切り開く 」] JT</ref>

In 1975, he became professor of Kitasato University School of Pharmacy. Meanwhile, the Ōmura laboratory raised many researchers and produced 31 university professors and 120 doctors.

At present date, Ōmura is professor emeritus at Kitasato University and Max Tishler Professor of Chemistry at Wesleyan University.

== Research ==
[[File:Ivermectin skeletal.svg|thumb|right|250px|A molecular diagram of Ivermectin, one of Omura's discoveries]]
Satoshi Ōmura is known for the discovery and development of various pharmaceuticals originally occurring in microorganisms. He was awarded the 2015 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] jointly with [[William C. Campbell (scientist)|William C. Campbell]] and Tu Youyou for discoveries concerning a novel therapy against infections caused by [[Nematode|roundworm]] [[Parasitism|parasites]]. More precisely, his research group isolated a strain of ''[[Streptomyces avermitilis]]'' that produce the anti-parasitical compound [[avermectin]].<ref name="omura11">{{cite journal |doi=10.2183/pjab.87.13|title=Ivermectin, 'Wonder drug' from Japan: The human use perspective|year=2011|last1=Crump|first1=Andy|last2=Omura|first2=Satoshi|journal=Proceedings of the Japan Academy, Series B|volume=87|issue=2|pages=13–28|pmid=21321478|pmc=3043740|bibcode=2011PJAB...87...13C}}</ref> Campbell later acquired these bacteria and developed the derived drug [[ivermectin]] that was first commercialised for veterinary use in 1981 later put to human use against [[Onchocerciasis]] in 1987-88 with the name '''Mectizan''',<ref name=omura11/> and is today used against [[river blindness]], [[lymphatic filariasis]], [[scabies]] and other parasitic infections.<ref name=Gairdner>{{cite news|title=Satoshi Omura PhD|url=http://www.gairdner.org/content/satoshi-omura|access-date=5 October 2015}}</ref><ref name=Nobelprize>[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2015/press-release/ Press release] NobelPrize.org</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Japanese microbiologist Satoshi Omura shares Nobel Prize for medicine|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/10/05/national/science-health/japanese-microbiologist-satoshi-omura-shares-nobel-prize-medicine/#.VhJx1uxViko|access-date=5 October 2015|publisher=The Japan Times|date=5 October 2015}}</ref>

Since the 1970s, Ōmura has discovered more than 480 new compounds, of which 25 kinds of drugs and reagents are in use. Examples include [[andrastin]], [[herbimycin]], [[neoxaline]] as well as: 
*a specific [[protein kinase inhibitor|inhibitor of protein kinase]] named [[staurosporine]];
*a proteasome inhibitor named [[lactacystin]];
*a fatty acid biosynthesis inhibitor named [[cerulenin]];

Furthermore, compounds having a unique structure and biological activity discovered by Omura are drawing attention in [[drug discovery research]], and new [[anticancer drugs]] and the like have been created.
