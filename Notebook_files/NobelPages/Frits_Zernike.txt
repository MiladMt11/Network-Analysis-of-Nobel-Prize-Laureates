'''Frits Zernike'''  ({{IPA-nl|ˈfrɪtˈsɛrnikə}}; 16 July 1888 – 10 March 1966) was a Dutch physicist and winner of the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1953 for his invention of the [[Phase-contrast microscopy|phase-contrast microscope]].

== Early life and education ==
Frits Zernike was born on 16 July 1888 in [[Amsterdam]], Netherlands to Carl Friedrich August Zernike and Antje Dieperink. Both parents were teachers of mathematics, and he especially shared his father's passion for physics. He studied chemistry (his major), mathematics and physics at the [[University of Amsterdam]].

== Academic career ==
In 1912, he was awarded a prize for his work on [[opalescence]] in gases. In 1913, he became the assistant of [[Jacobus Kapteyn]] at the astronomical laboratory of [[Groningen University]]. In 1914, Zernike and [[Leonard Ornstein]] were jointly responsible for the derivation of the [[Ornstein–Zernike equation]] in critical-point theory. In 1915, he obtained a position in [[theoretical physics]] at the same university and in 1920 he was promoted to full professor of [[theoretical physics]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In 1930, Zernike was conducting research into [[spectral line]]s when he discovered that the so-called ''ghost lines'' that occur to the left and right of each primary line in [[electromagnetic spectrum|spectra]] created by means of a [[diffraction grating]], have their phase shifted from that of the primary line by 90 degrees.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zernicke|first=Frits|date=1935|title=Das Phasenkontrastverfahren bei der mikroskopischen Beobachtung|journal=Zeitschrift für technische Physik|volume=16|pages=454–457}}</ref> It was at a Physical and Medical Congress in [[Wageningen]] in 1933, that Zernike first described his phase contrast technique in microscopy. He extended his method to test the figure of concave mirrors. His discovery lay at the base of the first phase contrast microscope, built during World War II.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

He also made another contribution in the field of optics, relating to the efficient description of the imaging defects or [[optical aberration|aberrations of optical imaging systems]] like [[microscope]]s and [[telescope]]s. The representation of aberrations was originally  based on the theory developed by [[Philipp Ludwig von Seidel|Ludwig Seidel]] in the middle of the nineteenth century. [[Philipp Ludwig von Seidel|Seidel's]] representation was based on [[power series]] expansions and did not allow a clear separation between various types and orders of aberrations. [[Zernike's orthogonal circle polynomials]] provided a solution to the long-standing problem of the optimum 'balancing' of the various aberrations of an optical instrument. Since the 1960s, [[Zernike's circle polynomials]] are widely used in [[optical design]], optical [[metrology]] and [[image analysis]].

Zernike's work helped awaken interest in [[coherence theory (optics)|coherence theory]], the study of partially coherent light sources. In 1938 he published a simpler derivation of Van Cittert's 1934 theorem on the coherence of radiation from distant sources, now known as the [[Van Cittert–Zernike theorem]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Van Cittert | first1 = P.

== Death ==
He died in the hospital at [[Amersfoort]], Netherlands in 1966 after suffering illness the last years of his life.<ref>{{cite book | last=Van Berkel | first=Klaas | author-link1 = Klaas van Berkel |author2=Van Helden, A.|author3=Palm, L.| title=A History of Science in The Netherlands.

== Honours and awards ==
In 1946, Zernike became member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00004022 |title=Frederik (Frits) Zernike (1888–1966) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |access-date=17 July 2015}}</ref>

In 1953, Zernike won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], for his invention of the [[phase-contrast microscope]], an instrument that permits the study of internal [[cell (biology)|cell]] structure without the need to [[staining|stain]] and thus kill the cells.<ref name="frs">{{Cite journal | last1 = Tolansky | first1 = S. | doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1967.0021 | title = Frits Zernike 1888-1966 | journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 13 | pages = 392–402| year = 1967 | s2cid = 123209453 }}</ref>

In 1954, Zernike became an Honorary Member of The Optical Society (OSA).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.osa.org/en-us/awards_and_grants/honorary_members/|title=OSA Honorary Members}}</ref> Zernike was elected a Foreign Member of the [[Royal Society]] (ForMemRS).<ref name="frs"/>

The university complex ([[University of Groningen#Campus|Zernike Campus]]) to the north of the city of [[Groningen]] is named after him, as is the crater [[Zernike (crater)|Zernike]] on the Moon.

Zernike's great-nephew [[Gerard 't Hooft]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1999.<ref>{{cite web | author=Robert Goldwyn | title=Gerardus 't Hooft Science Video Interview | url=http://www.vega.org.uk/video/programme/35}}</ref>

The Oz Enterprise, a [[Linux distribution]], was named after [[Leonard Ornstein]] and Frederik Zernike.
