'''Hans Fischer''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhans ˈfɪʃɐ|-|De-Hans Fischer.ogg}}; 27 July 1881 &ndash; 31 March 1945) was a [[Germany|German]] [[organic chemistry|organic chemist]] and the recipient of the 1930 [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]] "for his researches into the constitution of [[haemin]] and [[chlorophyll]] and especially for his synthesis of haemin."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1930/|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1930|publisher=nobelprize.org}}</ref>

==Biography==

===Early years===
Fischer was born in [[Höchst (Frankfurt am Main)|Höchst on Main]], now a city district of [[Frankfurt]]. His parents were Dr. Eugen Fischer, Director of the firm of Kalle & Co, [[Wiesbaden]], and Privatdozent at the Technical High School, [[Stuttgart]], and Anna Herdegen. He went to a primary school in Stuttgart, and later to the "Humanistisches [[gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]" in [[Wiesbaden]], matriculating in 1899. He read [[chemistry]] and [[medicine]], first at the [[University of Lausanne]] and then at [[Marburg]]. He graduated in 1904, and in 1908 he qualified for his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]]<ref name="Nobel">{{Nobelprize}} including the Nobel Lecture, December 11, 1930 ''On Haemin and the Relationships between Haemin and Chlorophyll''</ref>

===Career===
He worked first at a Medical Clinic in [[Munich]] and then at the [[First Berlin Chemical Institute]] under [[Hermann Emil Fischer|Emil Fischer]]. He returned to Munich in 1911 and qualified as lecturer on internal medicine one year later. In 1913, he became a lecturer in [[physiology]] at the Physiological Institute in Munich. In 1916, he became Professor of Medical Chemistry at the [[University of Innsbruck]] and from there he went to the [[University of Vienna]] in 1918.

From 1921 until his death, he held the position of Professor of Organic Chemistry at the [[Technical University of Munich]].

Fischer's scientific work was mostly concerned with the investigation of the pigments in [[blood]], [[bile]], and also [[chlorophyll]] in [[leaves]], as well as with the chemistry of [[pyrrole]] from which these pigments are derived. Of special importance was his synthesis of [[bilirubin]] and [[haemin]]. He received many honours for this work, and received the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1930. The [[lunar crater]] [[Fischer (crater)|Fischer]] was named after him (and [[Hermann Emil Fischer]]) in 1976.

===Personal life===
Fischer married Wiltrud Haufe in 1935. He committed suicide in [[Munich]] in despair over the destruction of his institute and his work during the last days of [[World War II]].
