==Education and early life==
Marcus was born in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], the son of Esther (born Cohen) and Myer Marcus. His father was born in [[New York City|New York]] and his mother was born in [[England]]. His family background is from [[Ukmergė]].<ref name=":0">Marcus, Rudolph A. Interview by Shirley K. Cohen. Pasadena, California, December 1, 7, and 14, 1993.

At McGill, Marcus took more math courses than an average chemistry student, which would later aid him in creating his theory on electron transfer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1992/marcus.html |title=Rudolph A.

He earned a [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]] in 1943 and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1946, both from [[McGill University]].<ref name=OralHistoryCHF>{{cite web|author=Center for Oral History| title= Rudolph A.

==Career and research==
After graduating, in 1946, he first worked at the [[National Research Council (Canada)]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oh.sciencehistory.org/sites/default/files/marcus_ra_0097_suppl.pdf}}</ref> followed by [[University of North Carolina]], and  [[Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn]]. In 1952, at the [[University of North Carolina]], he developed [[RRKM theory|Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus]] theory by combining RRK theory with [[transition state theory]]. In 1964, he taught at the [[University of Illinois]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/364323/Rudolph-A-Marcus |title=Rudolph A.

===Marcus theory of electron transfer===
Electron transfer is one of the simplest forms of a chemical reaction. It consists of one outer-sphere electron transfer between substances of the same atomic structure likewise to Marcus’s studies between bivalent and trivalent iron ions. Electron transfer may be one of the most basic forms of chemical reaction but without it life cannot exist. Electron transfer is used in all respiratory functions as well as photosynthesis. In the process of oxidizing food molecules, two hydrogen ions, two electrons, and an oxygen molecule react to make an exothermic reaction as well as H<sub>2</sub>O (water). Due to fact that electron transfer is such a broad, common, and essential reaction within nature, Marcus's theory has become vital within the field of chemistry.

'''2H<sup>+</sup> + 2e<sup>−</sup> + 1/2 O<sub>2</sub> → H<sub>2</sub>O + heat'''

A type of chemical reaction linked to his many studies of electron transfer would be the transfer of an electron between metal ions in different states of oxidation. An example of this type of chemical reaction would be one between a bivalent and a trivalent iron ion in an aqueous solution. In Marcus's time chemists were astonished at the slow rate in which this specific reaction took place. This attracted many chemists in the 1950s and is also what began Marcus's interests in electron transfer.  Marcus made many studies based on the principles that were found within this chemical reaction, and through his studies was able to create his famous Marcus theory. This theory gave way to new experimental programs that contributed to all branches within chemistry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cce.caltech.edu/faculty/marcus/index.html |title=FACULTY ::: Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering ::: CALTECH |publisher=Cce.caltech.edu |access-date=2013-08-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130806195818/http://www.cce.caltech.edu/faculty/marcus/index.html |archive-date=2013-08-06 }}</ref>
