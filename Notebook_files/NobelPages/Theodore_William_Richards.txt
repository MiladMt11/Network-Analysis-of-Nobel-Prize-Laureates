'''Theodore William Richards''' (January 31, 1868 – April 2, 1928) was the first [[American scientist]] to receive the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]], earning the award "in recognition of his exact determinations of the [[atomic weight]]s of a large number of the [[chemical element]]s."<ref>{{cite web | title = Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1914 - Presentation| url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1914/present.html | access-date = 2007-12-24 }}

== Biography ==

Theodore Richards was born in [[Germantown, Philadelphia|Germantown]], [[Pennsylvania]], to [[William Trost Richards]], a land- and seascape painter, and [[Anna Matlack Richards]], a poet.  Richards received most of his pre-college education from his mother.  During one summer's stay at [[Newport, Rhode Island]], Richards met Professor [[Josiah Parsons Cooke]] of [[Harvard]], who showed the young boy [[Saturn's rings]] through a small telescope.  Years later Cooke and Richards would work together in Cooke's laboratory.

Beginning in 1878, the Richards family spent two years in Europe, largely in England, where Theodore Richards' scientific interests grew stronger.  After the family's return to the United States, he entered [[Haverford College]], Pennsylvania in 1883 at the age of 14, earning a Bachelor of Science degree in 1885. He then enrolled at [[Harvard University]] and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1886, as further preparation for graduate studies.

Richards continued on at Harvard, taking as his dissertation topic the determination of the atomic weight of oxygen relative to hydrogen.  His doctoral advisor was Josiah Parsons Cooke.{{cn|date=August 2017}}  Following a year of post-doctoral work in [[Germany]], where he studied under [[Victor Meyer]] at the [[University of Göttingen]] and others, Richards returned to Harvard as an assistant in chemistry, then instructor, assistant professor, and finally full professor in 1901. In 1903 he became chairman of the Department of Chemistry at Harvard, and in 1912 he was appointed Erving Professor of Chemistry and Director of the new Wolcott Gibbs Memorial Laboratory.

In 1896, Richards married Miriam Stuart Thayer.  The couple had one daughter, Grace Thayer (who married [[James Bryant Conant]]), and two sons, Greenough Thayer and William Theodore.  Both sons died by suicide.<ref>{{cite book | last = Conant | first = Jennet | title = Tuxedo Park | publisher = Simon & Schuster | year = 2002 | url = https://archive.org/details/tuxedopark00jenn | url-access = registration | quote = Tuxedo Park. | isbn = 978-0-684-87288-9}}- See pages 1 &ndash; 3 for William Theodore Richards and page 126 for Greenough Thayer Richards.</ref>

Richards maintained interests in both art and music.  Among his recreations were sketching, golf, and sailing. He died at Cambridge, Massachusetts, on April 2, 1928, at the age of 60.  According to one of his descendants, Richards suffered from "chronic respiratory problems and a prolonged depression."<ref>{{cite book | last = Conant | first = Jennet | title = Tuxedo Park | publisher = Simon & Schuster | year = 2002 | url = https://archive.org/details/tuxedopark00jenn | url-access = registration | quote = Tuxedo Park. | page = [https://archive.org/details/tuxedopark00jenn/page/126 126] | isbn = 978-0-684-87288-9}}</ref>

He was a [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/257/000099957/|title=Theodore W. Richards|publisher=Notable Names Database|access-date=2011-09-18}}</ref>

==Scientific research==

[[Image:Theodore william richards.jpg|thumb|right|Theodore W. Richards]]

About half of Richards's scientific research concerned [[atomic weight]]s, starting in 1886 with his graduate studies. On returning to Harvard in 1889, this was his first line of research, continuing up to his death.  According to Forbes, by 1932 the atomic weights of 55 [[chemical elements|elements]] had been studied by Richards and his students.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Investigations of Atomic Weights by Theodore William Richards | author = Forbes, George Shannon | journal = Journal of Chemical Education | volume = 9 | issue =  3| year = 1932 | pages = 453&ndash;458 | doi=10.1021/ed009p452|bibcode = 1932JChEd...9..452F }}</ref> Among the potential sources of error Richards uncovered in such determinations was the tendency of certain salts to occlude gases or foreign solutes on precipitation.<ref>{{cite journal | title = Theodore William Richards Memorial Lecture | author = Hartley, Harold | journal = Journal of the Chemical Society |date=August 1930 | pages = 1945 | url = http://www.rsc.org/publishing/journals/article.asp?doi=JR9300001937 | doi = 10.1039/JR9300001937}}</ref> As an example of the care Richards used in his work, Emsley reports that he carried out 15,000 recrystallizations of thulium bromate in order to obtain the pure element [[thulium]] for an atomic weight measurement.<ref name=history>{{cite book| pages=442–443| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=Yhi5X7OwuGkC&pg=PA442| title =Nature's building blocks: an A-Z guide to the elements| author =John Emsley| publisher=Oxford University Press |location =US| year = 2001| isbn = 0-19-850341-5}}</ref>

Richards was the first to show, by chemical analysis, that an element could have different atomic weights. He was asked to analyze samples of naturally occurring [[lead]] and lead produced by radioactive decay.  His measurements showed that the two samples had different atomic weights, supporting the concepts of [[isotopes]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Theodore W.

Although Richards's chemical determinations of atomic weights were highly significant for their time, they have largely been superseded.  Modern scientists use electronic instrumentation, such as mass spectrometers, to determine both the masses and the abundances of an element's isotopes.  From this information, an average atomic mass can be calculated, and compared to the values measured by Richards.  The modern methods are faster and more sensitive than those on which Richards had to rely, but not necessarily less expensive.

Other scientific work of Theodore Richards included investigations of the compressibilities of atoms, heats of solution and neutralization, and the electrochemistry of amalgams.  His investigation of electrochemical potentials at low temperatures was among the work that led, in the hands of others, to the [[Nernst heat theorem]] and the [[Third law of thermodynamics]], although not without heated debate between Nernst and Richards.<ref>{{cite book | last = Nernst | first = Walther | title = The New Heat Theorem | url = https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.206086 | publisher = Methuen and Company, Ltd | year = 1926 }}- Reprinted in 1969 by Dover - See especially pages 227 &ndash; 231 for Nernst's comments on Richards work</ref>

Richards also is credited with the invention of the adiabatic [[calorimeter]] as well as the [[nephelometer]], which was devised for his work on the atomic weight of [[strontium]].
