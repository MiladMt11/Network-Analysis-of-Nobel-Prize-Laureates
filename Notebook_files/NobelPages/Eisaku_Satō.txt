{{Nihongo|'''Eisaku Satō'''|佐藤 榮作|Satō Eisaku|extra=27 March 1901 – 3 June 1975}} was a Japanese politician who served as [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] from 1964 to 1972. He is the third-longest serving Prime Minister, and ranks second in [[List of prime ministers of Japan#Rank by tenure|longest uninterrupted service]] as Prime Minister.

Satō entered the [[National Diet]] in 1949 as a member of the [[Liberal Party (Japan, 1945)|Liberal Party]]. Gradually rising through the ranks of Japanese politics, he held a series of cabinet positions. In 1964 he succeeded [[Hayato Ikeda]] as Prime Minister, becoming the first Prime Minister to have been born in the 20th century.

As Prime Minister, Satō presided over a period of rapid economic growth. He arranged for the formal return of [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]] ([[United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands|Ryukyu Islands]]; occupied by the United States since the end of the [[Second World War]]) to Japanese control. Satō brought Japan into the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons|Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]], for which he received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] as a co-recipient in 1974.

==Early life==
[[File:Eisaku Satō, Shigeru Yoshida, Saeki Ozawa 1953.jpg|thumb|left|From left Sato (then Minister of Construction), Prime Minister [[Shigeru Yoshida]] and Party chairman Saeki Ozawa (1953)]]
Satō was born in [[Tabuse, Yamaguchi|Tabuse]], [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]], on 27 March 1901 and studied [[German law]] at [[Tokyo Imperial University]]. In 1923, he passed the senior civil service examinations, and in the following year, upon graduation, became a [[civil servant]] in the [[Ministry of Railways (Japan)|Ministry of Railways]]. He served as Director of the Osaka Railways Bureau from 1944 to 1946 and [[Ministry of Transport (Japan)|Vice-Minister for Transport]] from 1947 to 1948.<ref name=nobelprize.org>{{cite web|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1974|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1974/sato-bio.html|publisher=Nobel Prize|access-date=6 January 2013}}</ref>

Satō entered the [[Diet of Japan|Diet]] in 1949 as a member of the [[Liberal Party (Japan, 1945)|Liberal Party]].

He served as Minister of [[Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (Japan)|Postal Services and Telecommunications]] from July 1951 to July 1952. Sato gradually rose through the ranks of Japanese politics, becoming [[Chief Cabinet Secretary (Japan)|chief cabinet secretary]] to then prime minister [[Shigeru Yoshida]] from January 1953 to July 1954. He later served as minister of construction from October 1952 to February 1953.

After the Liberal Party merged with the [[Democratic Party (Japan, 1954)|Japan Democratic Party]] to form the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]], Satō served as chairman of the party executive council from December 1957 to June 1958. Satō became [[Minister of Finance (Japan)|minister of finance]] in the cabinets of [[Nobusuke Kishi]] (his brother) in 1958-1960 {{clarify|text=and [[Hayato Ikeda]].|reason=Wasn't Sato the MITI in Ikeda's government?|date=December 2021}}

From July 1961 to July 1962, Satō was [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry|Minister of International Trade and Industry]]. From July 1963 to June 1964 he was concurrently head of the [[Hokkaido Development Agency|Hokkaidō Development Agency]] and of the [[:ja:%E7%A7%91%E5%AD%A6%E6%8A%80%E8%A1%93%E5%BA%81%E9%95%B7%E5%AE%98|Science and Technology Agency]].

==Prime minister==
[[File:Sato and Nixon 1972.png|thumb|Satō negotiated with U.S. president [[Richard Nixon]] for the repatriation of [[Okinawa]].]]
Satō succeeded Ikeda after the latter resigned due to ill health. His government was longer than many, and by the late 1960s he appeared to have single-handed control over the entire Japanese government. He was a popular prime minister due to the growing economy; his foreign policy, which was a balancing act between the interests of the [[United States]] and [[China]], was more tenuous. Student political radicalization led to numerous protests against Satō's support of the [[United States–Japan Security Treaty]], and Japanese tacit support for [[Vietnam war|American military operations in Vietnam]]. These protests expanded into massive riots, which eventually forced Satō to close the prestigious [[University of Tokyo]] for a year in 1969.<ref>Feilier. Learning to Bow. Page 80</ref>

After three terms as prime minister, Satō decided not to run for a fourth. His heir apparent, [[Takeo Fukuda]], won the Sato faction's support in the subsequent Diet elections, but the more popular [[Ministry of International Trade and Industry|MITI]] minister, [[Kakuei Tanaka]], won the vote, ending the Satō faction's dominance.

===Relations with China and Taiwan===
Satō is the last Prime minister of Japan to visit [[Republic of China|Taiwan]] during his term. In 1965, Satō approved a US$150 million loan to [[Republic of China|Taiwan]]. He visited [[Taipei]] in September 1967. In 1969, Satō insisted that the defense of Taiwan was necessary for the safety of Japan. Satō followed the United States in most major issues, but Satō opposed the [[Nixon visit to China]].<ref>MacMillan. Nixon and Mao: The Week that Changed the World</ref> Satō also bitterly opposed the entry of the PRC into the [[United Nations]] in 1971.

===Nuclear affairs===
In the 1960s Sato argued that Japan needed nuclear weapons to match those of China, but the United States opposed such.  The Johnson administration pressed Japan to sign the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]], ending, for then, Japan's nuclear ambitions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/imagine-japan-builds-nuclear-weapons-59512|title=Imagine This: Japan Builds Nuclear Weapons|date=25 May 2019}}</ref>

Satō introduced the [[Three Non-Nuclear Principles]] on 11 December 1967, which means non-production, non-possession, and non-introduction of [[nuclear weapon]]s. He later suggested the "Four-Pillars Nuclear Policy".{{Clarify|date=May 2010}} During the prime ministership of Satō, Japan entered the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]]. The Diet passed a resolution formally adopting the principles in 1971. For this he received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1974.

However, recent inquiries show that behind the scenes, Satō was more accommodating towards US plans of stationing nuclear weapons on Japanese soil. In December 2008, the Japanese government declassified a document showing that during a visit to the US in January 1965, he was discussing with US officials the possibility of using nuclear weapons against the [[People's Republic of China]].<ref>[http://www.hiroshimapeacemedia.jp/mediacenter/article.php?story=20081226170930777_en Editorial: The U.S. nuclear umbrella, past and future]</ref> In December 2009, his son reported that his father agreed in a November 1969 conversation with US President Nixon to allow the stationing of nuclear warheads in [[Okinawa]] once it was restored to Japanese sovereignty.<ref>[http://www.hiroshimapeacemedia.jp/mediacenter/article.php?story=20091224152025789_en Document on secret Japan-U.S. nuclear pact kept by ex-PM Sato's family]</ref>

===Okinawa issues===
Since the end of the [[Second World War]], [[Okinawa]] had been occupied by the [[United States]]. While visiting the [[United States]] in January 1965, Satō openly asked President [[Lyndon Johnson]] to return Okinawa to Japan. In August 1965, Satō became the first post-war prime minister of Japan to visit Okinawa.

In 1969, Satō struck a deal with U.S. president [[Richard Nixon]] to repatriate [[Okinawa]] and remove its nuclear weaponry: this deal was controversial because it allowed the [[United States Forces Japan|U.S. forces in Japan]] to maintain bases in Okinawa after repatriation.<ref>Ambrose. The Rise to Globalism. Page 235</ref> Okinawa was formally returned to Japan on 15 May 1972, which also included the [[Senkaku Islands]] (also known as the Diaoyu Islands in China and the subject, since 1971, of a Sino-Japanese sovereignty dispute; see [[Senkaku Islands dispute]]).

===Relations with Southeast Asia===
During Satō's term, Japan participated in the creation of the [[Asian Development Bank]] in 1966 and held a ministerial level conference on [[Southeast Asia]]n economic development.<ref name=hoshiro>{{cite web|last=Hoshiro|first=Hiroyuki|title=Postwar Japanese and Southeast Asian History - A New Viewpoint|url=http://ricas.ioc.u-tokyo.ac.jp/asj/eng/html/ess018.html|publisher=Research and Information Center for Asian Studies|access-date=6 January 2013|date=7 May 2007}}</ref> It was the first international conference sponsored by the Japanese government in the postwar period. In 1967, he was also the first Japanese prime minister to visit [[Singapore]]. He was largely supportive of the [[South Vietnam]]ese government throughout the [[Vietnam War]].

==Later life==
Satō shared the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] with [[Seán MacBride]] in 1974. He was awarded for representing the Japanese people's will for peace, and for signing the nuclear arms Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1970.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eisaku Sato|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1974/sato-facts.html|website=Nobel Prize|publisher=The Norwegian Nobel Institute|access-date=21 January 2015}}</ref> He was the first Asian to accept the Nobel Peace Prize. (In 1973, Vietnamese politician [[Le Duc Tho]] had become the first Asian to ''win'' the prize, but Tho had rejected it.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40611F73E5E0C778DDDA90994D8494D81 |title=Le Duc Tho, Top Hanoi Aide, Dies at 79 |last=Pace |first=Eric |date=1990-10-14 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=21 October 2013}}</ref>)

==Death==
While at a restaurant on 19 May 1975, Satō suffered a massive stroke, resulting in a coma. He died at 12:55&nbsp;a.m. on 3 June at the [[Jikei University School of Medicine|Jikei University]] Medical Center, aged 74. After a public funeral, his ashes were buried in the family cemetery at [[Tabuse]].

Satō was posthumously honored with the Collar of the [[Order of the Chrysanthemum]], the highest honor in the Japanese honors system.
