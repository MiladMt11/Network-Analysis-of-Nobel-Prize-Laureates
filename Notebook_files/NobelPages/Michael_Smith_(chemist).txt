'''Michael Smith''' {{post-nominals|CC|OBC|FRS}}<ref name=frs/> (April 26, 1932 – October 4, 2000) was a British-born Canadian biochemist and businessman. He shared the 1993 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]<ref name="ShampoKyle2003">{{cite journal|last1=Shampo|first1=Marc A.|last2=Kyle|first2=Robert A.|title=Michael Smith—Canadian Biochemist Wins 1993 Nobel Prize|journal=Mayo Clinic Proceedings|volume=78|issue=7|year=2003|pages=804|issn=0025-6196|doi=10.4065/78.7.804|pmid=12839073|doi-access=free}}</ref> with [[Kary Mullis]] for his work in developing [[site-directed mutagenesis]]. Following a PhD in 1956 from the [[University of Manchester]],<ref name=smithphd/> he undertook [[postdoctoral research]] with [[Har Gobind Khorana]] (himself a Nobel Prize winner) at the British Columbia Research Council in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada. Subsequently, Smith worked at the Fisheries Research Board of Canada Laboratory in Vancouver before being appointed a professor of biochemistry in the [[UBC Faculty of Medicine]] in 1966. Smith's career included roles as the founding director of the UBC [[Biotechnology]] Laboratory (1987 to 1995) and the founding scientific leader of the Protein Engineering Network of Centres of Excellence (PENCE). In 1996 he was named [[Peter Wall (property developer)|Peter Wall]] Distinguished Professor of Biotechnology. Subsequently, he became the founding director of the Genome Sequencing Centre (now called the Genome Sciences Centre) at the [[BC Cancer Research Centre]].

==Education and early life==

Smith was born April 26, 1932, in [[Blackpool]], [[Lancashire]], England. He immigrated to Canada in 1956 and became a [[Canadian citizen]] in 1963. Smith married Helen Wood Christie on August 6, 1960, on [[Vancouver Island]], BC, Canada. The couple had three children (Tom, Ian and Wendy) and three grandchildren, but separated in 1983. In his later years, Smith lived with his partner Elizabeth Raines in Vancouver until his death on October 4, 2000.<ref name="Ronsdale2004">"No Ordinary Mike: Michael Smith, Nobel Laureate" C Astell and E. Damer, Ronsdale Press 2004 {{ISBN|1553800141}}</ref><ref name="nobelprize.org">{{Nobelprize|name=Michael Smith|accessdate=2020-10-11}}</ref>

Smith first attended St. Nicholas Church of England School, a state-run elementary school. At the time, few children from state schools in England went on to further academic education, however Smith did well in the [[eleven plus exam]], and was an exception. A scholarship enabled him to attend the [[Arnold School]] for Boys. A further scholarship allowed him to study [[School of Chemistry, University of Manchester|Chemistry at the University of Manchester]], where he pursued his interest in industrial chemistry and was awarded a [[BSc]] followed by a [[PhD]] in 1956 for research into the [[stereochemistry]] of [[diol]]s.<ref name=smithphd>{{cite thesis|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Manchester|title=Studies in the stereochemistry of diols and their derivatives|first= Michael|last=Smith|date=1956|url=https://www.librarysearch.manchester.ac.uk/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=44MAN_ALMA_DS21203785760001631&context=L&vid=MU_NUI&search_scope=BLENDED&tab=local&lang=en_US|id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.488357}}|oclc=643620507|website=manchester.ac.uk}}</ref><ref name="Ronsdale2004" /><ref name="nobelprize.org"/><ref name="britannica">{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Smith-Canadian-chemist|title=Michael Smith, Canadian Chemist|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}</ref>

==Career==

===Researcher===

Smith's research career began with a post-doctoral fellowship at the British Columbia Research Council under the supervision of Khorana, who was developing new techniques of synthesizing [[nucleotides]]. The application of principles of physics and chemistry to living organisms was new at that time; [[DNA]] had been identified as the [[genetic material]] of a [[Cell (biology)|cell]], and Khorana and others were investigating how DNA encoded the [[proteins]] that constituted an [[organism]]. In 1960, when Khorana was offered and accepted a university position with excellent laboratory facilities in the Institute for Enzyme Research<ref>[http://pubs.wisc.edu/home/archives/gopher/education93/00000076.html Institute for Enzyme Research]. from UW-Madison School of Education Bulletin.</ref> at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], Smith moved with him.

After a few months in Wisconsin, Smith returned to Vancouver as a senior scientist and head of the Chemistry Division with the Vancouver Technological Station of the Fisheries Research Board (FRB) of Canada. In this role he conducted studies on the feeding habits and survival of spawning salmon, as well as identification of olfactory stimuli guiding salmon to their birth stream. His main research interest, however, continued to be nucleic acid synthesis, for which he received a [[United States Public Health Service]] Research Grant.

Concurrently with conducting research for FRB, Smith held the positions of associate professor at the University of British Columbia's (UBC) Department of Biochemistry and honorary professor in the Department of Zoology. In 1966, Smith was appointed a research associate of the [[Medical Research Council of Canada]], working within UBC's Department of Biochemistry.

Smith's particular area of interest remained the synthesis of oligonucleotides and the characterization of their properties. A sabbatical at the [[University of Cambridge]] in England with [[Fred Sanger]]<ref name=natureobit/><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brownlee|first1=George G.|author-link1=George Brownlee|title=Frederick Sanger CBE CH OM. 13 August 1918 – 19 November 2013|journal=[[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]]|year=2015|volume=61|publisher=Royal Society publishing|issn=0080-4606|doi=10.1098/rsbm.2015.0013|pages=437–466|doi-access=free}}</ref> placed Smith at the forefront of research into the organization of [[genes]] and [[genomes]] and methods of [[sequencing]] large DNA molecules. He returned from England as one of the world's leading molecular biologists.

Smith and his team began to investigate possibility of the creation of [[mutation]]s of any site within a viral genome. If possible, this process could be an efficient method to engineer heritable changes in genes. Finally, in 1977 they confirmed Smith's theory.<ref name="Ronsdale2004" />

====Site-specific Mutagenesis====

In the late 1970s, Smith concentrated on projects in molecular biology and how the genes within the DNA molecule act as reservoirs and transmitters of biological information. In 1978, Smith, in collaboration with former [[Fred Sanger]] lab sabbatical colleague [[Clyde A. Hutchison III]],<ref name=jbc/> introduced a new technique known as "oligonucleotide-directed site-directed mutagenesis" into molecular biology, resolving the problem of how to efficiently determine the effect of a single mutant gene. They developed a synthetic DNA technique for introducing site-specific mutations into genes. This permitted comparison of different protein molecules, revealing the role of the initial mutation.

The new technology enabled rapid identification and deliberate alteration of genes for the purpose of changing the characteristics of an organism. It raised the level of possibility of new diagnostic strategies and new treatments for genetic diseases, and even creation of novel artificial forms of life, as the progenitor technique for [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), [[Site-directed mutagenesis|Site-Directed Mutagenesis]] and [[Synthetic Biology]].

The team's paper describing site-directed mutagenesis was published as "Mutagenesis at a Specific Position in a DNA Sequence" in the ''[[Journal of Biological Chemistry]]'' in 1978.<ref name=jbc>{{Cite journal

===Administrator===

Smith was an administrator in 1981 at the Faculty of Medicine elected representative to the UBC Senate [clarify]. He served on the advisory committee of the [[Canadian Institute for Advanced Research]] Evolutionary Biology Program and on the Biotechnology Sector Committee of British Columbia. 1982 Smith launched the Centre for Molecular Genetics in the Faculty of Medicine and became its director in 1986. He was the interim scientific director of the UBC Biomedical Research Centre in 1991.

====Biotechnology Laboratory and PENCE====

In 1987, the Biotechnology Laboratory, one of three provincial "Centres of Excellence" was established at UBC. The new facility subsumed the Centre for Molecular Genetics, and Smith became its director. He played an important role in drawing together scientists, and in writing the proposal for what would become the "Protein Engineering Network of Centres of Excellence" or PENCE.

====Genome Sequence Centre====

Throughout the 1980s, Smith and his colleagues at the Canadian Institute for Advanced Research advocated for the establishment of a facility that would enable Canada to play a part in what had become known as the [[Human Genome Project]]. Eventually, funding was secured from the [[BC Cancer Agency]] and in 1999 the Genome Sequence Centre was established with a mandate to develop and deploy genomics technologies in support of the life sciences, and in particular cancer research. The Genome Sciences Centre also provided technology to Genome Canada and Genome BC projects in the areas of human health, the environment, forestry, agriculture, and aquaculture.<ref>National Post August 16, 2006</ref>

===Commercial ventures===
In 1981 Smith ventured into the business world as a pharmaceutical entrepreneur. In collaboration with Professors [[Earl Davie|Earl W. Davie]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hematology.org/Publications/Legends/3760.aspx|title=Earl W. Davie|publisher=American Society of Hematology}}</ref> and Benjamin D. Hall of the [[University of Washington]] founded [[ZymoGenetics]] in [[Seattle]], Washington, US. The company began working on recombinant proteins in an international initiative with [[Novo Nordisk]] of Denmark. [[Recombinant DNA]] is used mostly in basic research. ZymoGenetics was acquired by [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]].{{when|date=August 2015}} Further applications of recombinant DNA are found in human and veterinary medicine, in agriculture, and in bioengineering.

==Awards and honours==
Smith received many awards in addition to the Nobel Prize, and was known for his generosity. He donated half of the Nobel Prize money to researchers working on the genetics of [[schizophrenia]]. The other half he gave to BC [[Science World (Vancouver)|Science World]] and to the [[Society for Canadian Women in Science and Technology]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Michael Smith Laboratories -About Us – Dr. Michael Smith|url=https://www.msl.ubc.ca/about-us/#dr-michael-smith|accessdate=2021-02-07}}</ref> He received the Royal Bank Award in 1999,<ref>[http://www.rbc.com/about-rbc.html Royal Bank Award]</ref> and donated the companion grant to the [[BC Cancer Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.science.ca/scientists/scientistprofile.php?pID=18|title=Michael Smith: Organic Chemistry, Won the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1993 for discovering site-directed mutagenesis|publisher=science.ca}}</ref><ref name=msl>{{cite web|url=http://www.msl.ubc.ca|title=Michael Smith Laboratories|publisher=University of British Columbia}}</ref>
