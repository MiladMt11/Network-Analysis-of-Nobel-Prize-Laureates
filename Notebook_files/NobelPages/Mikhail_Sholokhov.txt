'''Mikhail Aleksandrovich Sholokhov''' ({{lang-rus|Михаил Александрович Шолохов|p=ˈʂoləxəf}};<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sholokhov "Sholokhov"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.</ref> {{OldStyleDate|24 May|1905|11 May}} – 21 February 1984) was a Russian [[novelist]] and winner of the 1965 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. He is known for writing about life and fate of [[Don Cossacks]] during the [[Russian Revolution]], the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] and the period of [[Soviet collectivization|collectivization]], primarily in his most famous novel, ''[[And Quiet Flows the Don]]''.

==Life and work==
Sholokhov was born in [[Russian Empire|Russia]], in the "land of the [[Cossacks]]" – the Kruzhilin hamlet, part of [[stanitsa]] [[Vyoshenskaya]], in the former [[Don Host Oblast|Administrative Region]] of the [[Don Cossack]] Host. His father, Aleksander Mikhailovich Sholokhov (1865–1925), was a member of the lower middle class, at different times a farmer, a cattle trader, and a miller. Sholokhov's mother, Anastasia Danilovna Chernikova (1871–1942), the widow of a Cossack, came from [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[peasant]] stock (her father was a peasant in the [[Chernihiv oblast]]). She did not become literate until a point in her life when she wanted to correspond with her son. His family were not Don Cossacks, but ''inogorodnye'' ("outlanders"), the rather disparaging term used by the Don Cossacks for outsiders who settled in the territory of the Don Cossack Host by the banks of the river Don. The ''inogorodyne'' tended to be much poorer than the Don Cossacks and were excluded from voting for officials in the Host government (the Don Cossack Host were allowed to elect almost of its leaders except for the ''ataman'' who headed the Host who was always appointed by the Emperor).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ryan |first1=Bryan |title=Major 20th-century writers: a selection of sketches from Contemporary authors |date=1991 |publisher=Gale Research |location=Farmington Hills |isbn=0810379155|page=2716}}</ref>

Sholokhov attended schools in {{Interlanguage link multi|Karginskaya|ru|3=Каргинская}}, [[Moscow]], [[Boguchar]], and Veshenskaya until 1918, when he joined the [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] side in the [[Russian Civil War]] at the age of 13. He spent the next few years fighting. During the Russian Civil War, the  ''inogorodnye''  tended to support the Reds while the Don Cossacks tended to support the Whites.

Sholokhov began writing at 17. He completed his first literary work, the short story "The Birthmark", at 19. In 1922 Sholokhov moved to Moscow to become a journalist, but he had to support himself through manual labour. He was a [[stevedore]], a [[stonemason]], and an [[accountant]] from 1922 to 1924, but he also intermittently participated in writers' "seminars". His first published work was a satirical article, ''The Test'' (19 October 1923).<ref name="Ermolaev, Herman 1982">Ermolaev, Herman (1982). ''Mikhail Sholokhov and His Art''. Princeton: Princeton University Press. p. 9.{{ISBN|9780691629834}}</ref> In 1924 Sholokhov returned to Veshenskaya and began devoting himself entirely to writing.<ref name=brit/> In the same year he married Maria Petrovna Gromoslavskaia (1901–1992), the daughter of Pyotr Gromoslavsky, the [[ataman]] of [[Bukanovskaya]] village. They had two daughters and two sons.

[[Image:Sholoh zen.jpg|frame|left|Mikhail Sholokhov and his wife, 1924]]

Sholokhov's first book ''Tales from the [[Don River, Russia|Don]]'', a volume of stories largely based on his personal experiences in his native region during [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Civil War]],  was published in 1926. The story "Nakhalyonok", partly based on his own childhood, was later made into a popular film.

In the same year, Sholokhov began writing ''[[And Quiet Flows the Don]]'', which took him fourteen years to complete (1926–1940). It became the most-read work of Soviet historical fiction, and it earned him both the 1941 [[State Stalin Prize]] and the 1965 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. It deals with the experiences of the Cossacks before and during World War I and the Russian Civil War.<ref name=brit/>

Another novel, ''Virgin Soil Upturned'', which earned a [[Lenin Prize]], took 28 years to complete. It is composed of two parts, ''Seeds of Tomorrow'' (1932) and ''Harvest on the Don'' (1960), and reflects life during collectivization in the Don area. It was heralded as a powerful example of [[socialist realism]]. 

The short story "[[Fate of a Man (short story)|The Fate of a Man]]" (1957) was made into a [[Fate of a Man|popular Russian film]].

During World War II Sholokhov wrote about the Soviet war effort for various journals. He also covered the devastation caused by Wehrmacht troops along the Don. His mother was killed when Veshenskaya was bombed in 1942.

Sholokhov's unfinished novel ''They Fought for Their Country'' is about World War II (known in the Soviet Union, and now in Russia, as the [[Great Patriotic War]]).

Sholokhov's collected works were published in eight volumes between 1956 and 1960.

==Authorship of texts==
First rumors of Sholokhov's supposed plagiarism appeared in 1928 following the success of the first two volumes of ''[[And Quiet Flows the Don]]'': it was speculated that the author stole the manuscript from a dead [[White Army]] officer.<ref>[[Gleb Struve|Struve, Gleb]] (1971). ''Russian Literature under Lenin and Stalin, 1917—1953''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press. p. 137 {{ISBN|978-0806109312}}</ref> Sholokhov asked the ''[[Pravda]]'' newspaper to prove his authorship, submitted his manuscripts of the first three volumes of ''And Quiet Flows the Don'' and the plan of the fourth one. In 1929 a special commission was formed that accepted Sholokhov's authorship. In the conclusion signed by four experts, the commission stated that there was no evidence of plagiarism on the one hand, and on the other hand the manuscripts' style was close to that of Sholokhov's previous book, ''Tales from the Don''.<ref>Письмо в редакцию // Правда. 1929. 29 марта. С. 4. (A Letter to the Editorial Office. Pravda, 1929, 29 March, p. 4.) (Russian)</ref>

The allegations resurfaced in the 1960s with [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] as a notable proponent, possibly in retaliation for Sholokhov's scathing opinion of Solzhenitsyn's novella ''[[One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich]]''.<ref name="feb-web.ru">Kuznetsov, F. (2003) [http://www.feb-web.ru/feb/sholokh/critics/nos/nos-096-.htm Рукопись "Тихого дона" и проблема авторства], pp. 96–206 in ''Новое о Михаиле Шолохове: Исследования и материалы''. Moscow: [[Gorky Institute of World Literature]]</ref> Several other writers have been proposed as the 'original' author, although [[Fyodor Kryukov]], a [[Cossack]] and [[Anti-Communist|Anti-Bolshevik]] who had died in 1920 has emerged as the leading candidate.<ref name=brit/><ref>Scammell, Michael (25 January 1998) [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/25/books/bookend-the-don-flows-again.html?pagewanted=all BOOKEND; The Don Flows Again].

In 1984 Norwegian Slavicist and mathematician [[Geir Kjetsaa]], in a monograph written with three other colleagues, provided statistical analyses of sentence lengths showing that Mikhail Sholokhov was likely the true author of ''And Quiet Flows the Don'',<ref>Kjetsaa, G., Gustavsson, S., Beckman, B., Gil, S. (1984) The Authorship of "The Quiet Don", Solum Forlag A.S., Oslo/Humanities Pres, NJ.</ref><ref>[[Nils Lid Hjort|Hjort N. L.]] (2007), "[http://www.cas.uio.no/Publications/Seminar/Consilience_LidHjort.pdf And quiet does not flow the Don: statistical analysis of a quarrel between Nobel laureates] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030122546/http://www.cas.uio.no/Publications/Seminar/Consilience_LidHjort.pdf |date=2008-10-30 }}", ''[http://www.cas.uio.no/publications_/consilience.php Consilience] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005040543/http://www.cas.uio.no/publications_/consilience.php |date=5 October 2015 }}'' (editor—Østreng W.) 134–140 (Oslo: Centre for Advanced Study at the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]]).</ref>

The debate focused on the published book, because Sholokhov's archive was destroyed in a bomb raid during the [[Second World War]] and no manuscript material or drafts were known. 143 pages of the manuscript of the 3rd & 4th books were later found and returned to Sholokhov; since 1975, they have been held by the Pushkin House in St Petersburg.<ref name="feb-web.ru"/> Then, in 1987, several hundred pages of notes and drafts of the work were discovered, including chapters excluded from the final draft. The writing paper dates back to the 1920s: 605 pages are in Sholokhov's own hand, and 285 are transcribed by his wife, Maria, and sisters.<ref>Karamysheva, Lyudmila (25 May 2000). [http://www.trud.ru/issue/article.php?id=200005250940801 РУКОПИСИ ВПРАВДУ НЕ ГОРЯТ!]. [[Trud (Russian newspaper)]]</ref><ref name="feb-web.ru"/> Sholokhov had had his friend Vassily Kudashov look after it, and after he was killed at war his widow took possession of the manuscript, but she never disclosed it. The manuscript was finally obtained by the [[Institute of World Literature (Moscow)|Institute of World Literature]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] in 1999 with assistance from the Russian government.

In 1999 the [[Russian Academy of Science]] carried out an analysis of the manuscript and came to the conclusion that ''And Quiet Flows the Don'' had been written by Sholokhov himself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lenta.ru/russia/1999/10/25/sholohov/ |title=Подлинность рукописи "Тихого Дона" установлена|publisher=lenta.ru|date=25 October 1999 |access-date=4 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513011705/http://lenta.ru/russia/1999/10/25/sholohov/ |archive-date=13 May 2013 }}</ref> A lengthy analysis by Felix Kuznetsov of the creative process visible in the papers provides detailed support for Sholokhov's authorship.<ref name="feb-web.ru"/>

During the 2000s a Russian-Israeli linguist Zeev Bar-Sella once again stated that Sholokhov was not the true author of ''And Quiet Flows the Don'' as well as his other works. Based on his own textual analysis of the novel he asserts that the manuscripts were written by Sholokhov not earlier than 1929 and names the writer [[Viktor Sevsky]] (real name [[Veniamin Krasnushkin]]) as the true author.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bar-Sella, Zeev.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/61489007|title=Literaturnyĭ kotlovan : proekt "Pisatelʹ Sholokhov"|last2=Бар-Селла, Зеев.|date=2005|publisher=Rossiĭskiĭ gos. gumanitarnyĭ universitet|isbn=5-7281-0816-4|location=Moskva|oclc=61489007}}</ref>

==Political and social activity==
[[File:Mikhail Sholokhov and Nikolai Belokhvostikov 1965.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Sholokhov (left) with the Soviet ambassador Nikolai Belokhvostikov at the Nobel Prize ceremonies in 1965]]
Sholokhov met [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1930, and subsequently was one of very few people who dared to give the dictator a truthful account of what was happening in the country and nonetheless was not punished. In the 1930s, he wrote several letters to Stalin from his home in [[Veshenskaya]] about the appalling conditions in the ''[[kolkhoz]]es'' and ''[[sovkhoz]]es'' along the Don, requesting assistance for the farmers.<ref>[http://next.feb-web.ru/feb/sholokh/texts/piv/piv-0221.htm1?cmd=1 ФЭБ: Переписка – 1997 (описание)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> In January 1931, he warned: "Comrade Stalin, without exaggeration, conditions are catastrophic!"<ref>[[#McSmith|McSmith]], p. 207</ref> On 4 April 1933, he sent a long letter in which, among many other details, he named two OGPU officers whom he accused of torturing prisoners from his district. Stalin reacted by sending a senior official, [[Matvei Shkiryatov]], to investigate. The two officers were arrested and sentenced to death; their sentences were later revoked, but they were banned from working in Sholokhov's home village.<ref>[[#McSmith|McSmith]], pp. 207–209</ref> Stalin also arranged for extra food to be sent to Veshenskaya and the neighbouring district.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Stalin's Letters to Molotov|last = Lah (ed)|first = Lars T.|publisher = Yale University Press|year = 1995|isbn = 0-300-06211-7|location = New Haven, CT|pages = 232}}</ref>

Sholokhov joined the [[CPSU]] in 1932, and in 1937 he [[1937 Soviet Union legislative election|was elected]] to the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]]. In August 1937, his best friend, the secretary of the Veshenskaya party committee, P.K. Lugovoi, was arrested. Sholokohov was due to take part in an international writers' conference, but he refused to leave the country while Lugovoi was being held. Stalin sent another official, [[Vladimir Stavsky]], to investigate, and invited Sholokhov to visit him in the Kremlin. After their meeting, on 4 November 1937, Lugovoi and two other prisoners on whose behalf Sholokhov had interceded were released, but in a subsequent letter to Stalin, he complained that the people responsible for wrongfully arresting them had not been punished.

On a visit to Moscow in 1938, Sholokhov met Yevgenia Yezhova, wife of [[Nikolai Yezhov]], the chief of police, and checked into a hotel room with her, unaware that the room was bugged. Yezhov heard the recording and attacked Yezhova.  On 23 October 1938, Sholokhov met Stalin in the Kremlin to complain that he had been put under surveillance in Veshenskaya, but when Yezhov was summoned to explain, he claimed not to know why. They met again on 31 October: this time the officer who had been investigating Sholokhov was also summoned. He said his orders had come from Moscow, but Yezhov again denied giving the order.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Stalin's Loyal Executioner: People's Commissar Nikolai Ezhov, 1895–1940|last = Jensen|first = Marc|publisher = Hoover Institution Press|year = 2002|isbn = 978-0-8179-2902-2|location = Stanford, CA|pages = [https://archive.org/details/stalinsloyalexec00jans/page/166159 166159–160]|url-access = registration|url = https://archive.org/details/stalinsloyalexec00jans/page/166159}}</ref> Sholokhov claimed that he completed the fourth and last volume of ''And Quiet Flows the Don'' and its sequel on 21 December 1939, the day when the USSR was celebrating what was supposedly Stalin's 60th birthday, and celebrated by opening a bottle of wine that Stalin had given him. He then wrote to Stalin to say how he had marked the special day.<ref>[[#McSmith|McSmith]], p. 221</ref>

In 1959 he accompanied Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] on a trip to Europe and the United States. He became a member of the [[CPSU Central Committee]] in 1961,<ref name=brit/> [[Academician]] of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]] in 1939, and was a member of the [[USSR Supreme Soviet]]. He was twice awarded the title of [[Hero of Socialist Labor]], and later became vice president of the [[Union of Soviet Writers]].

He commented on the [[Sinyavsky–Daniel trial]] at the [[23rd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|23rd Congress]] by saying that the prison terms meted out to Sinyavsky and Daniel had been much too lenient compared to the "revolutionary understanding of what is right" during the 1920s, which turned part of the Soviet intelligentsia against him and resulted in two open letters by [[Lydia Chukovskaya]] and [[Yuri Galanskov]] addressed to Sholokhov.<ref>Quoted in Morson, Gary Saul (8 February 2019) [https://www.wsj.com/articles/stalins-scribe-review-collaborator-laureate-11549638213  "Collaborator Laureate"].

==Late years==
Sholokhov almost stopped writing after 1969 and spent the late years at the [[Vyoshenskaya]] [[stanitsa]]. He used his [[Order of Lenin]] money to build a local school and his [[Nobel Prize]] to take the family on a road trip over Europe and [[Japan]].<ref>Aleksei Torgashev. [https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/2295905 Who and how spent his Nobel Prize] article at [[Kommersant]], from [[Ogoniok]] №41, p. 16, 16 October 2005 (in Russian)</ref> In 1972 he became a vocal critic of [[Alexander Yakovlev (Russian politician)|Alexander Yakovlev]], then a head of the Central Committee Propaganda Department, and his article "Against Antihistoricism" which attacked Russian nationalism; this resulted in a [[Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] meeting and removal of Yakovlev from his position (he was then sent as an ambassador to [[Canada]]).<ref>[[Yegor Ligachyov|Ligachyov, Yegor]] (2018).

Mikhail Sholokhov died on 21 February 1984 from [[laryngeal cancer]]. He was buried in the grounds of his house at the Vyoshenskaya stanitsa along with his wife Maria Petrovna Sholokhova (nee Gromoslavskaya, 1902—1992).<ref name='museum'>[http://eng.sholokhov.ru/objects/mansion/ Official website] of the [[National Sholokhov Museum-Reserve]]</ref>
