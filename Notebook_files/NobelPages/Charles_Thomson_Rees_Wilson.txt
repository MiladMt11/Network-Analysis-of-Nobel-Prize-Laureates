== Education and early life==
Wilson was born in the parish of [[Glencorse]], [[Midlothian]] to Annie Clark Harper and John Wilson, a sheep farmer. After his father died in 1873, he moved with his family to [[Manchester]]. With financial support from his step-brother he studied biology at [[Victoria University of Manchester|Owens College]], now the University of Manchester, with the intent of becoming a doctor. In 1887, he graduated from the College with a [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]]. He won a scholarship to attend [[Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge]] where he became interested in physics and chemistry. In 1892 he received 1st class honours in both parts of the [[Natural Sciences (Cambridge)|Natural Science Tripos]].<ref name="ODNB">{{Cite ODNB|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36950|title=Wilson, Charles Thomson Rees (1869–1959)|last=Longair|first=Malcolm S.|date=2006|access-date=28 January 2017|edition=Online|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/36950}}</ref><ref>{{acad|id=WL888CT|name=Wilson, Charles Thomson Rees}}</ref><ref name="Nobel Laureate">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1927/wilson-bio.html|title=C.T.R.

==Career==
He became particularly interested in [[meteorology]], and in 1893 he began to study clouds and their properties. Beginning in 1894, he worked for some time at the [[observatory]] on [[Ben Nevis]],<ref name="Origin and context">{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Earle R.|date=1 August 2010|title=Origin and context of C.

He was particularly fascinated by the appearance of [[Glory (optical phenomenon)|glories]].<ref name="Brocklehurst">{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-20608377|title=Charles Thomson Rees Wilson: The man who made clouds|last=Brocklehurst|first=Steven|date=7 December 2012|work=BBC News|access-date=8 June 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref> He then tried to reproduce this effect on a smaller scale at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] in Cambridge, expanding humid air within a sealed container. He later experimented with the creation of cloud trails in his chamber by condensation onto [[ion]]s generated by [[radioactivity]]. Several of his cloud chambers survive.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Phillipson|first=Tacye|date=December 2016|title=Surviving Apparatus Showing the Early Development of the Cloud Chamber|journal=Bulletin of the Scientific Instrument Society}}</ref>

Wilson was made Fellow of Sidney Sussex College, and University Lecturer and Demonstrator in 1900.<ref name="Nobel2"/> He was known by some as a poor lecturer, due to a pronounced stutter.<ref name="Halliday">{{Cite journal|last=Halliday|first=E.C.|title=Some Memories of Prof. C.T.R.

== Contributions ==
The invention of the cloud chamber was by far Wilson's signature accomplishment, earning him the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1927.<ref name="Nobel Laureate"/> The Cavendish laboratory praised him for the creation of "a novel and striking method of investigating the properties of ionized gases".<ref name="Collotype">{{Cite book|title=A history of the Cavendish laboratory 1871–1910.With 3 portraits in a collotype and 8 other illustrations.|date=1910|publisher=London|hdl = 2027/coo1.ark:/13960/t0ns19f2h}}</ref> The cloud chamber allowed huge experimental leaps forward in the study of subatomic particles and the field of particle physics, generally. Some have credited Wilson with making the study of particles possible at all.<ref name="Brocklehurst" />

== Method ==
Retrospectively, Wilson's experimental method has received some attention from scholars.

In a period of scientific inquiry characterized by a divide between "analytical" and "morphological" scientists, Wilson's method of inquiry represented a hybrid. While some scientists believed phenomena should be observed in pure nature, others proposed laboratory-controlled experiments as the premier method for inquiry. Wilson used a combination of methods in his experiments and investigations.<ref name="Gooding">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bk4sUpSx1LsC&pg=PA225|title=The Uses of Experiment: Studies in the Natural Sciences|last1=Gooding|first1=David|last2=Pinch|first2=Trevor|last3=Schaffer|first3=Simon|date=18 May 1989|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521337687|language=en}}</ref> Wilson's work "made things visible whose properties had only previously been deduced indirectly".<ref name="Brocklehurst" />

He has been called "almost the last of the great individual experimenters in physics".<ref name="Halliday" /> He used his cloud chamber in various ways to demonstrate the operating principles of things like subatomic particles and X-rays.<ref name="Investigations" /><ref name="Making Visible" /> But his primary interest, and the subject of the bulk of his papers, was meteorology.<ref name="Gooding" />

In 2012, the Royal Society of Edinburgh held a meeting in honor of Wilson, the "Great Scottish Physicist".<ref name="Aplin" />

==Personal life==
In 1908, Wilson married Jessie Fraser, the daughter of a [[religious minister|minister]] from [[Glasgow]]. The couple had four children. His family knew him as patient and curious, and fond of taking walks in the hills near his home.<ref name="Bowler" /> He died at his home in [[Carlops]] on 15 November 1959, surrounded by his family.<ref name="ODNB" />
