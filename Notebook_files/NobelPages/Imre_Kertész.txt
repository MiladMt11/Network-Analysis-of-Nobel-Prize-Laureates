'''Imre Kertész''' ({{IPA-hu|ˈimrɛ ˈkɛrteːs|lang}}; 9 November 1929{{snd}}31 March 2016) was a Hungarian author and recipient of the 2002 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], "for writing that upholds the fragile experience of the individual against the barbaric arbitrariness of history".<ref name=nobel>{{cite news|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2002/press.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 2002 – Imre Kertész|work=Nobelprize.org|access-date=9 February 2008}}</ref> He was the first Hungarian to win the Nobel in Literature. His works deal with themes of [[the Holocaust]] (he was a survivor of a German concentration camp), dictatorship and personal freedom.<ref name="Seattletimes"/> He died on 31 March 2016, aged 86, at his home in Budapest  after suffering from [[Parkinson's disease]] for several years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Imre Kertész gestorben|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/kultur/kertesz-gestorben-101.html|publisher=Tagesschau|access-date=31 March 2016|language=de|date=31 March 2016}}</ref><ref name="Guardian obituary" />

== Life and work ==
Kertész was born in Budapest, Hungary, on 9 November 1929, the son of Aranka Jakab and László Kertész,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hermann|first1=Péter|last2=Pásztor|first2=Antal|title=Magyar és nemzetközi ki kicsoda, 1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B6JmAAAAMAAJ&q=Aranka+Jakab+Laszlo+Kert%C3%A9sz|access-date=31 March 2016|language=hu|isbn=978-963-7943-27-0|year=1994}}</ref> a middle-class Jewish couple. After his parents separated when he was around the age of five, Kertész attended a boarding school and, in 1940, he started secondary school where he was put into a special class for Jewish students.<ref name=tagesschau>{{cite web|title=Literaturnobelpreisträger Kertész gestorben: Der Retter seiner Seele|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/kultur/kertesz-gestorben-103.html|publisher=Tagesschau|access-date=31 March 2016|language=de|date=31 March 2016}}</ref> During [[World War II]], Kertész was deported in 1944 at the age of 14 with other [[List of Hungarian Jews|Hungarian Jews]] to the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]], and was later sent to [[Buchenwald]].<ref name="Britannica" /> Upon his arrival at the camps, Kertész claimed to be a 16-year old worker, thus saving him from the instant extermination that awaited a 14-year old.<ref name="nyt">{{cite news|last1=Kandell|first1=Jonathan|title=Imre Kertesz, Nobel Laureate Who Survived Holocaust, Dies at 86|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/world/europe/imre-kertesz-dies.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=31 March 2016|date=31 March 2016}}</ref> After his camp was liberated in 1945, Kertész returned to Budapest,<ref name="Guardian" /> graduated from high school in 1948,<ref name="mandinerdeath">{{cite web|title=Elhunyt Kertész Imre|trans-title=Imre Kertész has died|url=http://mandiner.hu/cikk/20160331_elhunyt_kertesz_imre|website=Mandiner|language=hu|access-date=31 March 2016|date=31 March 2016}}</ref> and then went on to find work as a journalist and translator. In 1951, he lost his job at the journal ''Világosság'' (Clarity) after the publication started leaning towards Communism.<ref name="Guardian" /> For a short term he worked as a factory worker and then in the press department of the Ministry of Heavy Industry.<ref name="Guardian obituary">{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/31/imre-kertesz-obituary | title=Imre Kertész obituary | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=31 March 2016 | access-date=1 April 2016 | author=George Gomori}}</ref> From 1953 he started freelance journalism and translated various works into Hungarian, including [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and [[Elias Canetti]].<ref name="Seattletimes" />

His best-known work, ''[[Fatelessness]]'' (''Sorstalanság''), describes the experience of 15-year-old György (George) Köves in the concentration camps of Auschwitz, Buchenwald and [[Zeitz]]. Written between 1969 and 1973, the novel was initially rejected for publication by the Communist regime in Hungary, but was published in 1975.<ref name="Seattletimes" /> Some have interpreted the book as quasi-autobiographical, but the author disavows a strong biographical connection. The book would go on to become part of many high school curriculums in Hungary.<ref name="Seattletimes" /> In 2005, a [[Fateless (film)|film based on the novel]], for which he wrote the script, was made in Hungary.<ref name="NYT">{{cite news|first=Alan|last=Riding|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/03/movies/MoviesFeatures/03fate.html|title=The Holocaust, From a Teenage View|work=The New York Times|date=3 January 2006|access-date=8 February 2008}}</ref> Although sharing the same title, some reviews noted that the film was more autobiographical than the novel on which it was based. It was released internationally at various dates in 2005 and 2006.

Following on from ''Fatelessness'', Kertész's ''Fiasco'' (1988) and ''[[Kaddish for an Unborn Child]]'' (1990) are, respectively, the second and third parts of his Holocaust trilogy.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/31/imre-kertesz-holocaust-survivor-nobel-laureate-novelist-dies | title=Imre Kertész, Holocaust survivor and Nobel laureate, dies at 86 | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=31 March 2016 | access-date=31 March 2016}}</ref> His writings translated into English include ''Kaddish for an Unborn Child'' (''Kaddis a meg nem született gyermekért'') and ''Liquidation'' (''Felszámolás''), the latter set during the period of Hungary's evolution into a democracy from communist rule.<ref name="Seattletimes" />

From the beginning, Kertész found little appreciation for his writing in Hungary,<ref name="Britannica" /> and he moved to Germany where he received more active support from publishers and reviewers, along with more appreciative readers. After his move, he continued translating German works into Hungarian,<ref name="Britannica">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9395919/Imre-Kertesz|title=Imre Kertész|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=9 February 2008}}</ref> notably ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'', the plays of [[Dürrenmatt]], [[Schnitzler]], and [[Tankred Dorst]], and various thoughts and aphorisms of [[Wittgenstein]]. Kertész also continued working at his craft, writing his fiction in Hungarian but did not publish another novel until the late 1980s.<ref name="NYT" /> But from that point on, he submitted his work to publishers in Hungary until his death in March 2016. Grateful that he had found his most significant success as a writer and artist in Germany, Kertész left his [[Abatement of debts and legacies|abatement]] to the [[Academy of Arts, Berlin|Academy of Arts]] in Berlin.<ref name=tagesschau/>

In November 2013, Kertész underwent successful surgery on his right hip after falling down in his home.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.politics.hu/20131122/kertesz-undergoes-surgery/ | title=Kertész undergoes surgery | work=Politics.hu | date=22 November 2013 | access-date=1 April 2016}}</ref> However, he continued to deal with various health concerns during the last few years of his life. He was diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]], and was again suffering from [[Depression (mood)|depression]], reported to have been a recurring battle in his own life. In fact, Kertész had struggled with this same issue through his art, as the main character of his 2003 book ''Felszámolás'' (''Liquidation'') commits suicide after struggling with depression.<ref name="Guardian obituary" />

Kertész died in Budapest on 31 March 2016 at the age of 86.<ref name="Seattletimes">{{cite news|title=Nobel literature laureate Imre Kertesz dies at 86|author=Pablo Gorondi|agency=Associated Press|via=The Seattle Times|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nobel-literature-laureate-imre-kertesz-dies-at-86/|access-date=31 March 2016}}</ref>

== Controversy ==
Kertész was a controversial figure within Hungary, especially since being Hungary's first and only [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Laureate in Literature]], he still lived in Germany. This tension was exacerbated by a 2009 interview with ''[[Die Welt]]'', in which Kertész vowed himself a "[[Berlin]]er" and called Budapest "completely balkanized."<ref>{{cite web |title=Kertészkedés |url=http://hangorienidiocc.blog.hu/2009/11/08/kerteszkedes_5 |access-date=11 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Krause |first1=Tilman |title=Ich schreibe keine Holocaust-Literatur, ich schreibe Romane |url=https://www.welt.de/welt_print/kultur/literatur/article5116030/Ich-schreibe-keine-Holocaust-Literatur-ich-schreibe-Romane.html |newspaper=[[Die Welt]]|access-date=31 March 2016 |language=de |date=7 November 2009}}</ref> Many Hungarian newspapers reacted negatively to this statement, claiming it to be hypocritical. Other critics viewed the Budapest comment ironically, saying it represented "a grudge policy that is painfully and unmistakably, characteristically Hungarian."<ref name="Hungarian Literature Online">{{cite web |title=Kertész birthday interview causes controversy |url=http://www.hlo.hu/news/kertesz_birthday_interview_causes_controversy |publisher=Hungarian Literature Online |access-date=11 May 2014}}</ref> Kertész later clarified in a [[Duna TV]] interview that he had intended his comment to be "constructive" and called Hungary "his homeland".<ref name="Hungarian Literature Online" />

Also controversial was Kertész's criticism of [[Steven Spielberg]]'s depiction of the Holocaust in the 1993 film ''[[Schindler's List]]'' as [[kitsch]], saying: "I regard as kitsch any representation of the Holocaust that is incapable of understanding or unwilling to understand the organic connection between our own deformed mode of life and the very possibility of the Holocaust."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/holocaust/reflections.htm |title=Holocaust Reflections |publisher=English.illinois.edu |access-date=31 January 2011}}</ref>

In November 2014 Kertész was the subject of an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]''. Kertész claimed the reporter was expecting him to question Hungary's democratic values and was shocked to hear Kertész say that "the situation in Hungary is nice, I'm having a great time." According to Kertész, "he didn't like my answer. His purpose must have been to make me call Hungary a dictatorship which it isn't. In the end the interview was never published."<ref name="Hungarian Literature Online2">{{cite web |title=Elhallgatta a New York Times Kertész Imre véleményét |trans-title=The New York Times has kept back the opinion of Imre Kertész |url=http://mandiner.hu/cikk/20141111_elhallgatta_a_new_york_times_kertesz_imre_velemenyet |website=Mandiner |language=hu |date=11 November 2014 |access-date=11 November 2014}}</ref>
