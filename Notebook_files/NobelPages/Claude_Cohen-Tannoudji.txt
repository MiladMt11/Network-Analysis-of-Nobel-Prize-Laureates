'''Claude Cohen-Tannoudji''' (born 1 April 1933) is a French [[physicist]]. He shared the 1997 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] with [[Steven Chu]] and [[William Daniel Phillips]] for research in methods of [[laser cooling]] and trapping atoms. Currently he is still an active researcher, working at the [[École normale supérieure (Paris)]].<ref name=":0"/>

==Early life==
Cohen-Tannoudji was born in [[Constantine, Algeria|Constantine]], [[French Algeria]], to Algerian Jewish parents Abraham Cohen-Tannoudji and Sarah Sebbah.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/124559/Claude-Cohen-Tannoudji|title=Claude Cohen-Tannoudji - French physicist|access-date=4 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lejdd.fr/Societe/Images/Les-Nobel-francais-de-physique/Claude-Cohen-Tannoudji-il-y-a-10-ans-12894 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-02-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213182648/http://www.lejdd.fr/Societe/Images/Les-Nobel-francais-de-physique/Claude-Cohen-Tannoudji-il-y-a-10-ans-12894 |archive-date=2015-02-13 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=A Century of Nobel Prize Recipients: Chemistry, Physics, and Medicine |author=Francis Leroy |page=218 |date= 13 Mar 2003 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Nobel Prize Winners in Physics |author=Arun Agarwal |page=298 |date= 15 Nov 2005 }}</ref> When describing his origins Cohen-Tannoudji said: "My family, originally from Tangier, settled in Tunisia and then in Algeria in the 16th century after having fled Spain during the Inquisition. In fact, our name, Cohen-Tannoudji, means simply the Cohen family from Tangiers. The Algerian Jews obtained the French citizenship in 1870 after Algeria became a French colony in 1830."<ref name= bio>{{cite web|last=Claude Cohen-Tannoudji|title=Claude Cohen-Tannoudji - Autobiographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1997/cohen-tannoudji-bio.html|publisher=NobelPrize.org|access-date=13 February 2015}}</ref>

After finishing secondary school in [[Algiers]] in 1953, Cohen-Tannoudji left for [[Paris]] to attend the [[École normale supérieure|École Normale Supérieure]].<ref name=bio/> His professors included [[Henri Cartan]], [[Laurent Schwartz]], and [[Alfred Kastler]].<ref name=bio/>

In 1958 he married Jacqueline Veyrat, a high school teacher, with whom he has three children. His studies were interrupted when he was [[conscription|conscripted]] into the army, in which he served for 28 months (longer than usual because of the [[Algerian War]]). In 1960 he resumed working toward his [[doctorate]], which he obtained from the [[École normale supérieure|École Normale Supérieure]] under the supervision of [[Alfred Kastler]] and [[Jean Brossel]] at the end of 1962.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.phys.ens.fr/~cct/anglais/cct_en.htm|title=Claude Cohen-Tannoudji|website=www.phys.ens.fr|access-date=2017-12-21}}</ref>

==Career==
[[File:Paris de la Recherche - Claude Cohen-Tannoudji 7.jpg|thumb|left|Claude Cohen-Tannoudji in 2010]]
After his dissertation, he started teaching [[quantum mechanics]] at the [[University of Paris]]. From 1964-67, he was an associate professor at the university and from 1967-1973 he was a full professor.<ref name=":0" /> His lecture notes were the basis of the popular textbook, ''Mécanique quantique'', which he wrote with two of his colleagues.  He also continued his research work on [[atom]]-[[photon]] interactions, and his research team developed the model of the ''[[light dressed state|dressed atom]]''.

In 1973, he became a professor at the [[Collège de France]].<ref name=":0" /> In the early 1980s, he started to lecture on radiative forces on atoms in [[laser]] light fields. He also formed a laboratory there with [[Alain Aspect]], Christophe Salomon, and [[Jean Dalibard]] to study laser cooling and trapping. He even took a statistical approach to laser cooling with the use of [[stable distributions]].<ref>Bardou, F., Bouchaud, J. P., Aspect, A., & Cohen-Tannoudji, C. (2001). Non-ergodic cooling: subrecoil laser cooling and Lévy statistics.</ref>

In 1976, he took sabbatical leave from the Collège de France, and lectured at [[Harvard University]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Claude Cohen-Tannoudji (Collège de France), "Atom-Photon Interactions" - MIT Physics Department Special Seminar 4/29/1992 |url=https://infinitehistory.mit.edu/video/claude-cohen-tannoudji-coll%C3%A8ge-de-france-atom-photon-interactions%E2%80%9D-mit-physics-department |publisher=MIT |access-date=9 September 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Curriculum Vitae (Claude Cohen-Tannoudji) |url=http://www.phys.ens.fr/~cct/anglais/cv_e.htm |publisher=École normale supérieure |access-date=9 September 2020}}</ref> At Harvard, he was a Loeb Lecturer for two weeks,<ref>{{cite web |title=Loeb and Lee Lectures Archive: 1953 - 1990 |url=https://www.physics.harvard.edu/loeblee3 |publisher=Harvard University |access-date=9 September 2020}}</ref> and at MIT, he was a visiting professor.<ref>{{cite web |title=Massachusetts Institute of Technology Bulletin (1975-1976) |url=https://libraries.mit.edu/archives/mithistory/presidents-reports/1976.pdf |publisher=MIT |access-date=9 September 2020}}</ref> 

His work eventually led to the [[Nobel Prize]] in physics in 1997 "for the development of methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light", shared with [[Steven Chu]] and [[William Daniel Phillips]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1997/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1997|date=1997|website=nobelprize.org|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|access-date=14 December 2014}}</ref> Cohen-Tannoudji was the first physics Nobel prize winner born in an Arab country.<ref>{{cite web |title=Claude Cohen-Tannoudji |url=https://www.osa.org/en-us/history/biographies/bios/claude-cohen-tannoudji/ |website=OSA Living History |publisher=The Optical Society |access-date=3 February 2020}}</ref> 

In 2015, Cohen-Tannoudji signed the ''[[Mainau Declaration|Mainau Declaration 2015 on Climate Change]]'' on the final day of the 65th [[Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings|Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting]]. The declaration was signed by a total of 76 Nobel Laureates and handed to then-President of the French Republic, [[François Hollande]], as part of the successful [[Paris Climate Change Conference|COP21 climate summit]] in Paris.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mainaudeclaration.org/|title=Mainau Declaration|website=www.mainaudeclaration.org|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref>
