==Life==
Willstätter was born into a Jewish family in [[Karlsruhe]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Fritz Haber: chemist, Nobel Laureate, German, Jew |last=Stoltzenberg |first=Dietrich |year=2004 |publisher=Chemical Heritage Foundation |isbn=978-0-941901-24-6 |page=203 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ekNIaJX3-YC&q=Richard+Willst%C3%A4tter+jewish&pg=PA203 }}</ref> He was the son of Maxwell (Max) Willstätter, a textile merchant, and his wife, Sophie Ulmann.

He went to school at the Karlsruhe Gymnasium and, when his family moved to [[Nuremberg]], he attended the Technical School there. At age 18 he entered the [[University of Munich]] to study science and stayed for the next fifteen years. He was in the Department of Chemistry, first as a student of [[Alfred Einhorn]]—he received his doctorate in 1894{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} – then as a faculty member. His doctoral thesis was on the structure of [[cocaine]]. Willstätter continued his research into other [[alkaloid]]s and synthesized several of them. In 1896 he was named [[Lecturer]] and in 1902 ''Professor extraordinarius'' (professor without a chair).

In 1905 he left Munich to become professor at the [[ETH Zürich]] and there he worked on the plant pigment [[chlorophyll]]. He first determined its empirical formula.

In 1912 he became professor of chemistry at the [[University of Berlin]] and director of the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry]], studying the structure of pigments of flowers and fruits. It was here that Willstätter showed that chlorophyll was a mixture of two compounds, [[chlorophyll a]] and [[chlorophyll b]].<ref>{{citation

In 1915 his friend [[Fritz Haber]] asked him to join in the development of poison gases.<ref>L.F.Haber (1986). ''The Poisonous Cloud:  Chemical Warfare in the First World War'', Clarendon Press</ref> Willstätter would not work on poisons but agreed to work on protection.  He and his coworkers developed a three layer filter that absorbed all of the enemy's gases. Thirty million were manufactured by 1917 and Willstätter was awarded the Iron Cross Second Class.<ref>Van der Kloot, W. (2004). ''April 1915: Five future Nobel prize-winners inaugurate weapons of mass destruction and the academic-industrial-military complex''. Notes Rec. R. Soc. Lond. 58: 149–160, 2004/</ref>

In 1916 he returned to Munich as the successor to his mentor Baeyer. During the 1920s  Willstätter investigated the mechanisms of [[enzyme kinetics|enzyme reactions]] and did much to establish that [[enzyme]]s are chemical substances, not biological organisms. However, to the end of his life he refused to accept that enzymes were proteins.

In 1924 Willstätter's career came to "a tragic end when, as a gesture against increasing antisemitism, he announced his retirement."<ref name="nobel" /> According to his Nobel biography:<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1915/willstatter-bio.html Richard Willstätter – Biography<!-- bot-generated title -->] at nobelprize.org</ref> "Expressions of confidence by the Faculty, by his students and by the Minister failed to shake the fifty-three year old scientist in his decision to resign. He lived on in retirement in Munich....Dazzling offers both at home and abroad were alike rejected by him."<ref name="nobel" /> His only research was with assistants who telephoned their results. Despite pleas for him to move to Jerusalem or to Switzerland earlier in the 1930s, Willstätter did not flee from Germany until 1939.

In 1939 Willstätter emigrated to [[Switzerland]]. He spent the last three years of his life there in [[Muralto]] near [[Locarno]] writing his autobiography. He died of a heart attack in 1942.

Willstätter's autobiography, ''Aus meinem Leben'', was not published in German until 1949. It was translated into English as ''From My Life'' in 1965.<ref name="Willstätter">Richard Willstätter: ''Aus meinem Leben'', edited by A. Stoll, Verlag Chemie, Weinheim, 1949; English edition: ''From My Life'', Benjamin, New York, 1965.</ref>

==Family==

In 1903, he married Sophie Leser, who died in 1908.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-902198-84-5|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}</ref> They had two children.

==Honours==

In 1965, the school in Nuremberg he had attended named itself ''Willstätter-Gymnasium'', in his honour.<ref>[http://www.willstaetter-gymnasium.de/unsere-schule/schulchronik/richard-willstaetter/biographie.html School Homepage {{in lang|de}} ''The Meaning of our School's Name – Richard Willstätter and his Legacy'', accessed 3 May 2020]</ref>
