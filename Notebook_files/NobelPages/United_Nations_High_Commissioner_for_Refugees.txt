The '''United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees''' ('''UNHCR''') is a [[United Nations System|UN agency]] mandated to aid and protect [[refugee]]s, [[Internally displaced person|forcibly displaced communities]], and [[Statelessness|stateless people]], and to assist in their [[voluntary return|voluntary repatriation]], local integration or [[third country resettlement|resettlement to a third country]]. It is headquartered in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], with over 17,300 staff working in 135 countries.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|title=Figures at a Glance|url=https://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html|access-date=2020-08-18|website=UNHCR|language=en}}</ref>

== Background ==
UNHCR was created in 1950 to address the refugee crisis that resulted from [[World War II]]. The [[1951 refugee convention|1951 Refugee Convention]] established the scope and legal framework of the agency's work, which initially focused on Europeans uprooted by the war. Beginning in the late 1950s, displacement caused by other conflicts, from the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Uprising]] to the [[Decolonisation of Africa|decolonization]] of Africa and Asia, broadened the scope of UNHCR's operations. Commensurate with the [[Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees|1967 Protocol to the Refugee Convention]], which expanded the geographic and temporal scope of refugee assistance, UNHCR operated across the world, with the bulk of its activities in developing countries.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|title=History of UNHCR|url=https://www.unhcr.org/history-of-unhcr.html|access-date=2020-08-18|website=UNHCR|language=en}}</ref> By its 65th anniversary in 2015, the agency had assisted more 50 million refugees worldwide.

As of June 2020, UNHCR has over 20 million refugees under its mandate.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|title=Figures at a Glance|url=https://www.unhcr.org/figures-at-a-glance.html|access-date=2020-08-18|website=UNHCR|language=en}}</ref> Consequently, its annual budget has grown from US$300,000 in 1951 to US$8.6 billion in 2019, making it one of the largest UN agencies by expenditure.<ref name=":4" /><ref>[https://www.unsceb.org/content/FS-F00-03?gyear=2018 Expenditure by Agency]</ref> The vast majority of UNCHR's budget comes from voluntary contributions, mostly from member states; the largest donors are the United States, the European Union, and Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|title=Donors|url=https://www.unhcr.org/donors.html|access-date=2020-08-18|website=UNHCR|language=en}}</ref> The agency's work includes providing protection, shelter, healthcare and emergency relief, assisting in resettlement and repatriation, and advocating for national and multilateral policies on behalf of refugees.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|title=Advocacy|url=https://www.unhcr.org/advocacy.html|access-date=2020-08-18|website=UNHCR|language=en}}</ref>

In recognition of its work, UNHCR has won two [[Nobel Peace Prize]]s, in 1954 and 1981 and a [[Prince of Asturias Awards#International Cooperation (Cooperación Internacional)|Prince of Asturias Awards for International Cooperation]] in 1991.<ref name="NobelFactsorg">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/lists/organizations.html|title=Nobel Laureates Facts – Organizations|publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|access-date=2009-10-13}}</ref> It is a member of the [[United Nations Development Group]], a consortium of organizations dedicated to [[sustainable development]].<ref>[http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13 UNDG Members] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511144047/http://www.undg.org/index.cfm?P=13|date=11 May 2011}}.

== History ==
[[File:Genf UNHCR.JPG|right|thumb|Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]]
Following the demise of the [[League of Nations]] and the formation of the United Nations the international community was acutely aware of the [[refugee crisis]] following the end of [[World War II]]. In 1947, the [[International Refugee Organization]] (IRO) was founded by the United Nations.<ref name="unhcr.org">[http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/4214cb4f2.html Refworld | Self-Study Module 1: An Introduction to International Protection. Protecting Persons of Concern to UNHCR]. Unhcr.org (1 August 2005). Retrieved on 2013-07-12.</ref> The IRO was the first international agency to deal comprehensively with all aspects of refugees' lives. Preceding this was the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]], which was established in 1944 to address the millions of people displaced across Europe as a result of World War II.<ref name="unhcr.org"/>

In the late 1940s, the IRO fell out of favour, but the UN agreed that a body was required to oversee global refugee issues. Despite many heated debates in the General Assembly, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was founded as a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly by Resolution 319 (IV) of the United Nations General Assembly of December 1949. However, the organisation was only intended to operate for 3 years, from January 1951, due to the disagreement of many UN member states over the implications of a permanent body.<ref name="unhcr.org"/>

UNHCR's mandate was originally set out in its statute, annexed to resolution 428 (V) of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] of 1950. This mandate has been subsequently broadened by numerous resolutions of the General Assembly and its [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC).<ref name="unhcr.org"/> According to UNHCR, its mandate is to provide, on a non-political and humanitarian basis, international protection to refugees and to seek permanent solutions for them.<ref name="unhcr.org" />

Soon after the signing of the [[1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]], it became clear that refugees were not solely restricted to Europe. In 1956, UNHCR was involved in coordinating the response to the uprising in [[Hungary]]. Just a year later, UNHCR was tasked with dealing with Chinese refugees in Hong Kong, while also responding to Algerian refugees who had fled to [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]] in the wake of [[Algeria]]'s war for independence. The responses marked the beginning of a wider, global mandate in refugee protection and [[humanitarian assistance]].<ref name="unhcr.org"/>

Decolonisation in the 1960s triggered large refugee movements in Africa, creating a massive challenge that would transform UNHCR; unlike the refugee crises in Europe, there were no durable solutions in Africa, and many refugees who fled one country only found instability in their new country of refuge. By the end of the decade, two-thirds of UNHCR's budget was focused on operations in Africa and in just one decade, the organization's focus had shifted from an almost exclusive focus on Europe.<ref name="unhcr.org"/>

In 1967, the [[Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees]] was ratified to remove the geographical and temporal restrictions of UNHCR under the [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees|1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees]]. As the Convention was confined to the refugee crisis in the aftermath of World War II in Europe, the Protocol was made to address the “new refugee situations that have arisen since the Convention was adopted and the refugees concerned that may therefore not fall within the scope of the Convention”.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN</ref>
In the 1970s, UNHCR refugee operations continued to spread around the globe, with the mass exodus of East Pakistanis to [[India]] shortly before the birth of [[Bangladesh]]. Adding to the woes in Asia was the [[Vietnam War]], with millions fleeing Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam.<ref name="unhcr.org"/>
The 1980s saw new challenges for UNHCR, with many member states unwilling to resettle refugees due to the sharp rise in refugee numbers over the 1970s. Often, these refugees were not fleeing wars between states, but inter-ethnic conflict in newly independent states. The targeting of civilians as military strategy added to the displacement in many nations, so even 'minor' conflicts could result in a large number of displaced persons. Whether in Asia, Central America or Africa, these conflicts, fueled by superpower rivalry and aggravated by socio-economic problems within the concerned countries, durable solutions continued to prove a massive challenge for the UNHCR. As a result, the UNHCR became more heavily involved with assistance programs within refugee camps, often located in hostile environments.<ref name="unhcr.org"/>
The end of the [[Cold War]] marked continued inter-ethnic conflict and contributed heavily to refugee flight. In addition, humanitarian intervention by multinational forces became more frequent and the media began to play a big role, particularly in the lead up to the 1999 [[NATO]] mission in [[Yugoslavia]], while by contrast, the [[1994 Rwandan Genocide]] had little attention. The genocide in Rwanda caused a massive refugee crisis, again highlighting the difficulties for UNHCR to uphold its mandate, and the UNHCR continued to battle against restrictive refugee policies in so called 'rich' nations.<ref name="unhcr.org"/>

According to a 2021 study, the UNHCR has fulfilled its mandate to serve refugees independent of their location consistently over time. The organization has shown limited bias towards donors in the geographical distribution of its funds.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Thorvaldsdottir|first=Svanhildur|last2=Patz|first2=Ronny|last3=Goetz|first3=Klaus H|date=2021|title=Mandate or Donors?

[[File:UNHCR DADAAB REGION, KENYA AFRICA DOD 2006.JPEG|thumb|UNHCR packages containing tents, tarps, and mosquito netting sit in a field in [[Dadaab]], Kenya, on 11 December 2006, following disastrous flooding]]
UNHCR was established on 14 December 1950<ref name="History">{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49c3646cbc.html|title=History of UNHCR: A global humanitarian organization of humble origins|publisher=UNHCR|access-date=2009-11-01}}</ref> and succeeded the earlier [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]]. The agency is mandated to lead and co-ordinate international action to protect refugees (other than [[Palestinian refugee]]s, who are assisted by [[UNRWA]]) and resolve refugee problems worldwide. Its primary purpose is to safeguard the rights and well-being of refugees. It strives to ensure that everyone can exercise the right to [[asylum seeker|seek asylum]] and find safe refuge in another state, with the option to [[voluntary return|return home voluntarily]], integrate locally or to [[third country resettlement|resettle in a third country]].

UNHCR's mandate has gradually been expanded to include protecting and providing humanitarian assistance to whom it describes as other persons "of concern," including [[internally displaced person]]s (IDPs) who would fit the legal definition of a [[refugee]] under the 1951 United Nations [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] and 1967 Protocol, the 1969 [[OAU Convention|Organization for African Unity Convention]], or some other treaty if they left their country, but who presently remain in their country of origin. UNHCR presently has major missions in [[Lebanon]], [[South Sudan]], [[Chad]]/[[Darfur]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]] as well as [[Kenya]] to assist and provide services to IDPs and [[refugee camp|refugees in camps]] and in [[urban refugee|urban settings]].

UNHCR maintains a database of refugee information, ProGres, which was created during the [[Kosovo War]] in the 1990s. The database today contains data on over 11 million refugees or about 11% of all displaced persons globally. The database contains biometric data, including [[fingerprint]]s and [[Iris recognition|iris scans]] and is used to determine aid distribution for recipients. The results of using biometric verification have been successful. When introduced in Kenyan refugee camps of [[Kakuma]] and [[Dadaab]] in the year 2013, the [[World Food Programme|UN World Food Programme]] was able to eliminate $1.4m in waste and fraud.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21716637-technology-has-made-migrating-europe-easier-over-time-it-will-also-make-migration|title=Phones are now indispensable for refugees|website=The Economist|access-date=2017-02-20}}</ref>

To achieve its mandate, the UNHCR engages in activities both in the countries of interest and in countries with donors. This includes hosting "expert roundtables" to discuss issues of concern to the international refugee community.

=== Public awareness and future of refugees ===
[[File:UNHCR Stamps of Tajikistan 2001.jpg|thumb|UNHCR 50th anniversary. Stamp of Tajikistan, 2001.]]

Several new programs have recently been introduced to support and to heighten awareness of the issues faced by refugees around the world. These two new programs are a product of the benchmarks set out by the [[United Nations Millennium Development Goals]].

The UNHCR works in different regions of the world to raise awareness about the refugee crisis and the needs of these refugees.

Since 2009, the UNHCR acknowledged a large presence of migration and refugees in the [[Caribbean]], where the refugee crisis remained largely unreported.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/latest/2011/2/4d5d27676/unhcr-caribbean-partners-work-raise-awareness-invisible-refugees.html|title=UNHCR and Caribbean partners work to raise awareness of "invisible" refugees|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|newspaper=UNHCR|access-date=2016-11-16}}</ref> The issue stems from refugees who, instead of applying to the U.N., improperly search for asylum in the United States, ultimately failing to reach their destination and remaining in the Caribbean.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://ftp.jamaicagleaner.com/power/14496|title=UNHCR discuss plight of refugees in Caribbean|website=ftp.jamaicagleaner.com|access-date=2016-11-16}}</ref> However, migrant laws in some of these nations lacked any protections for [[Asylum seeker|asylum-seekers]], including the ability to be recognized as such.<ref name=":0" /> In response, the UNHCR organized talks with these nations in [[Costa Rica]] in 2009,<ref name=":1" /> seeking to address the lack of protections for refugees and their prosecution as unauthorized migrants.<ref name=":0" /> A refugee-seeker applies through the U.N. for placement and an asylum-seeker applies within the Country in which asylum is sought. This is why some Countries label refugees as illegal when they did not apply through the U.N. for placement and entered the country unlawfully.

In 2007, UNHCR offices in Canada launched an aggressive media campaign to shed light on the plight of refugees.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=http://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/latest/2007/5/464884684/canadian-made-refugee-awareness-campaign-aims-shock.html|title=Canadian-made refugee awareness campaign aims to shock|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|newspaper=UNHCR|access-date=2016-11-16}}</ref> This campaign was meant to humanize the refugee crisis by showing refugees living in the midst of disturbing conditions. Using emotional appeals to raise public awareness, the campaign hoped to increase the interest of particularly "30 to 45-year-old professionals who are generally well educated, well-read, but have not had direct experience or knowledge of refugee issues,”<ref name=":2" /> according to fund-raising officer Jonathan Wade.

In Ireland, the UNHCR works to inform the public through different channels. The UNHCR in Ireland actively pursues media relations.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.ie/our-work-in-ireland/building-awareness|title=Building Awareness|last=Refugees|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|website=www.unhcr.ie|access-date=2016-11-16}}</ref> It also holds public events with the aim of informing people about current refugee crises. One of these is the annual UNHCR/SARI Fair play Football Cup.<ref name=":3" />

The UNHCR was prominent in helping Syrian refugees in Lebanon. When the Lebanese government was unable to withstand the influx of refugees, the UNHCR stepped in and eased the displacement for the refugees mainly by offering food and healthcare. They also helped register the refugees, so they would not be considered illegal in the eyes of the Lebanese government. Many Syrian refugees are also in Jordan.

=== Artworks on refugee crisis and artists as activists for refugees ===
Many contemporary artists had art workshops and art project and took many initiatives for refugees including artist [[Ai Weiwei]] and [[Anish Kapoor]] led London walk of compassion for refugees walking from the Royal Academy of Arts to the Orbit. Among art exhibitions and artworks on refugees, Ai created an inflatable artwork is 230 feet long which he exhibited at Prague's National Gallery and Sydney Biennale in 2018,The human rights activist has brought a 196-foot-long inflatable installation to Sydney's Cockatoo Island as one of the cornerstones of the Biennale of Sydney exhibition. Ai states: "There’s no refugee crisis, only a human crisis… In dealing with refugees we’ve lost our very basic values. In this time of uncertainty, we need more tolerance, compassion and trust for each other, since we are all one, otherwise humanity will face an even bigger crisis."

Danish artist [[OLAFUR ELIASSON]]’S GREEN LIGHT welcomes conversation about refugee crisis. In Paris walls along the Seine a photo exhibition along the banks included a 370-meter long panorama featuring portraits of refugees and photographs titled “Dreams of Humanity” taken by Syrian refugee children living in Iraq which was organized in collaboration with famous photojournalist Reza in partnership with UNHCR. Bangladeshi artist [[Firoz Mahmud]] has been conducting an art project on refugees, displaced people and minorities, titling 'Soaked Dream project' of dream and future desire of those deprived and underprivileged people which he exhibited at Bangkok Art Biennale curated by [[Apinan Poshyananda]], Lahore Biennale, [[Dhaka Art Summit]], [[MAXXI]] Rome, Office for Contemporary Art, Oslo and many cities in the world. The Harmony Art Collective had an exhibition of young refugees made murals together in Darling Quarter, Sydney.

=== Cooperation within the United Nations ===
As UNHCR is a programme governed by the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]], and the [[UN Economic and Social Council]], it cooperates with many other programs and agencies under the United Nations in order to effectively protect the rights of refugees.

On 19 September 2016, the UN General Assembly hosted the UN Summit for Refugees and Migrants, a high-level summit to address large movements of refugees and migrants, with the aim of bringing countries together behind a more humane and coordinated approach.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://refugeesmigrants.un.org/summit|title=Summit for Refugees and Migrants - 19 September 2016|date=2014-12-12|access-date=2016-09-29}}</ref> Leaders of the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]], [[UN Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women]], [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime|UN Office on Drugs and Crime]], and the [[World Bank]] were present. The summit addressed the root causes and drive for migration and the necessity of global cooperation. As a result of this summit, the United Nations unveiled a draft set of principles that urge the international community to build on the momentum set by the adoption of the New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (2016).<ref name="NY_DEC_REF-MIG_2016">{{cite web |title=New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants |url=http://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/71/1 |website=un.org |publisher=UN |access-date=8 November 2018}}</ref><ref name="UN_NY_DEC_2016">{{cite web |title=New York Declaration |url=https://refugeesmigrants.un.org/declaration |website=un.org |publisher=UN |access-date=8 November 2018}}</ref> Specifically, the 20 draft principles focus on human rights; non-discrimination; rescue and assistance; access to justice; border governance; returns; violence; detention; family unity; child migrants; women migrants; right to health; adequate standard of living; decent work; right to education; right to information; monitoring and accountability; migrants’ human rights defenders; data; and international cooperation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=54978#.V-xRGvCLQ2w|title=UN News - UN official unveils draft principles on protecting human rights of refugees and migrants|last=Section|first=United Nations News Service|date=2016-09-20|website=UN News Service Section|access-date=2016-09-29}}</ref>

On 28 September 2016, the UNHCR partnered with the UN [[Food and Agriculture Organization|Food and Agricultural Organization]] in Tehran for the Solutions Strategy for Afghan Refugees. FAO highlighted the contributions to be made by FAO towards SSAR objectives on livelihood related activities including livestock and fishery initiatives as well as nutritional projects in Iranian schools.

FAO and UNHCR are committed to increasing refugees’ access to livelihood opportunities and reducing dependency on humanitarian aid. Of late, a joint livelihood strategy for South Sudan&nbsp;was launched looking to address this issue with a clearly defined action plan. The strategy targets both refugees (70 percent) and local communities (30 percent) in refugee-hosting areas across the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/africa/news/detail-news/en/c/417501/|title=UNHCR and FAO help vulnerable refugees and South Sudanese families strengthen their food security|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2016-09-29}}</ref>

=== Awards ===
Since 1954, the [[Nansen Refugee Award|UNHCR Nansen Refugee Award]] has been annually awarded to a person or an organization in recognition of outstanding service to the cause of refugees, displaced or stateless people.

The UNHCR itself was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1954 and 1981. The UNHCR was awarded the [[Indira Gandhi Prize]] in 2015.

In 1991 was awarded the [[Prince of Asturias Awards#International Cooperation (Cooperación Internacional)|Prince of Asturias Award for International Cooperation]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.fpa.es/en/princess-of-asturias-awards/laureates/1991-unhcr-united-nations-high-comissioner-for-refugees.html?especifica=0|title=UNHCR (United Nations High Comissioner [sic] for Refugees) - Laureates - Princess of Asturias Awards - The Princess of Asturias Foundation|last=Tecnologías|first=Developed with webControl CMS by Intermark|work=The Princess of Asturias Foundation|access-date=2018-10-21|language=en}}</ref>

== Persons of concern to UNHCR ==

The UNHCR's Mid-Year Trends report of June 2015 (based on information for mid-2015 or latest available information up to that date) reported an "unprecedented" 57,959,702 individuals falling under its mandate (for reference, on 1 January 2007, 21,018,589 people – or less than half of the number in 2015 – fell under the mandate of the UNHCR). The sharp increase was mainly attributed to the [[Syrian Civil War]], "with the outbreak of armed crises or the deterioration of ongoing ones in countries like [[Afghanistan]], [[Burundi]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Mali]], [[Somalia]], [[South Sudan]] and the [[Ukraine]] contributing to prevailing trends."<ref>{{Cite web

== Controversies ==

=== The 1994–95 repatriation of Rohingyans ===
According to some scholars, with time UNHCR left an initial preference for asylum and resettlement policies, tending to prefer repatriation measures of refugees instead. Sometimes, this might have led the agency's bureaucratic apparatus to adopt pathological behaviours.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Barnett |first1=Michael |last2=Finnemore |first2=Martha |title=Rules for the world |url=https://archive.org/details/rulesforworldint00barn |url-access=limited |date=2004 |publisher=Cornell University Press |pages=[https://archive.org/details/rulesforworldint00barn/page/n40 73]-104}}</ref>

An example of the latter might be considered{{according to whom|date=April 2020}} the handling of the 1995 Rohingyan crisis. At the time, thousands of Rohingyans were fleeing Burma (or Myanmar), seeking shelter in UNHCR camps in Bangladesh.
