'''André Frédéric Cournand''' (September 24, 1895 – February 19, 1988) was a French-American [[physician]] and [[physiologist]].

==Biography==
Cournand was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1956 along with [[Werner Forssmann]] and [[Dickinson W. Richards]] for the development of [[cardiac catheterization]].

Born in [[Paris]], Cournand emigrated to the [[United States]] in 1930 and, in 1941, became a [[naturalized citizen]].  For most of his career, Cournand was a professor at the [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]] and worked at [[Bellevue Hospital]] in [[New York City]].

Many seats of medical research have recognized his work, and he has received the Anders Retzius Silver Medal of the Swedish Society for Internal Medicine (1946), the [[Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research]] (1949), the John Philipps Memorial Award of the American College of Physicians (1952), the Gold Medal of the Académie Royale de Médecine de Belgique and of the Académie Nationale de Médecine, Paris (1956). He was elected Doctor (honoris causa) of the Universities of Strasbourg (1957), Lyon (1958), Brussels (1959), Pisa (1961), and D.Sc. of the University of Birmingham (1961).
