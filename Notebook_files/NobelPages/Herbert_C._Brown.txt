'''Herbert Charles Brown''' (May 22, 1912 – December 19, 2004) was an American chemist and recipient of the 1979 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his work with [[organoborane]]s.

==Life and career==
Brown was born '''Herbert Brovarnik''' in [[London]], to Ukrainian Jewish immigrants from [[Zhitomir]], Pearl (''[[née]]'' Gorinstein) and Charles Brovarnik, a hardware store manager and carpenter.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jEy67gEvIuMC&pg=PA605|title=Nobel Laureates in Chemistry, 1901-1992|first=James K.|last=Laylin|date=30 October 1993|publisher=Chemical Heritage Foundation|via=Google Books|isbn=9780841226906}}</ref> His family moved to [[Chicago]] in June 1914, when he was two years old.<ref name="Nobel-bio">{{cite web | author = Wilhelm Odelberg | title = Herbert C.

Unable to find a position in industry, he decided to accept a postdoctoral position.  This became the beginning of his academic career.  He became an instructor at the University of Chicago in 1939, and held the position for four years before moving to [[Wayne University]] in Detroit as an assistant professor.  In 1946, he was promoted to associate professor.  He became a [[professor]] of [[inorganic chemistry]] at [[Purdue University]] in 1947<ref name="purdue-bio">

During [[World War II]], while working with [[Hermann Irving Schlesinger]], Brown discovered a method for producing [[sodium borohydride]] (NaBH<sub>4</sub>), which can be used to produce [[borane]]s, compounds of [[boron]] and [[hydrogen]]. His work led to the discovery of the first general method for producing asymmetric pure [[enantiomer]]s. The elements found as initials of his name [[hydrogen|H]], [[carbon|C]] and [[boron|B]] were his working field.

In 1969, he was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/od/nms/recip_details.cfm?recip_id=59|title=The President's National Medal of Science: Recipient Details - NSF - National Science Foundation|website=www.nsf.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015220111/http://www.nsf.gov/od/nms/recip_details.cfm?recip_id=59|archive-date=2012-10-15}}</ref>

Brown was quick to credit his wife Sarah with supporting him and allowing him to focus on creative efforts by handling finances, maintaining the house and yard, etc. According to Brown, after receiving the Nobel prize in [[Stockholm]], he carried the medal and she carried the US$100,000 award.

In 1971, he received the Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Golden Plate Awardees of the American Academy of Achievement |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://achievement.org/our-history/golden-plate-awards/#science-exploration}}</ref>

He died December 19, 2004, at a [[hospital]] in [[Lafayette, Indiana]] after a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. His wife died May 29, 2005, aged 89.

Diborane has a pair of [[Three-center two-electron bond|three-center two-electron bonds.]]]] As a doctoral student at the [[University of Chicago]], Herbert Brown studied the reactions of [[diborane]], B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>. [[Hermann Irving Schlesinger|Hermann Irving Schlesinger's]] laboratory at the University of Chicago was one of two laboratories that prepared diborane. It was a rare compound that was only prepared in small quantities. Schlesinger was researching the reactions of diborane to understand why the simplest hydrogen-boron compound is B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> instead of BH<sub>3</sub>.<ref name="Lecture">{{cite web |url=http://www.chem.purdue.edu/hcbrown/nobel.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-05-14 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809033952/http://www.chem.purdue.edu/hcbrown/nobel.pdf |archive-date=2014-08-09 }}</ref>

[[File:Ketone diborane reduction.png|thumb|A general reaction between diborane and a [[ketone]]]] When Brown started his own research, he observed the reactions of diborane with [[aldehydes]], [[ketones]], [[esters]], and [[acid chlorides]]. He discovered that diborane reacts with aldehydes and ketones to produce dialkoxyboranes, which are [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzed]] by water to produce [[alcohols]]. Until this point, organic chemists did not have an acceptable method of [[redox|reducing]] [[carbonyls]] under mild conditions. Yet Brown's Ph.D. thesis published in 1939 received little interest. Diborane was too rare to be useful as a synthetic reagent.<ref name="Lecture"/>

In 1939, Brown became the research assistant in Schlesinger's laboratory. In 1940, they began to research volatile, low molecular weight uranium compounds for the [[National Defense Research Committee]]. Brown and Schlesinger successfully synthesized volatile uranium(IV) borohydride, which had a molecular weight of 298. The laboratory was asked to provide a large amount of the product for testing, but diborane was in short supply. They discovered that it could be formed by reacting [[lithium hydride]] with [[boron trifluoride]] in [[ethyl ether]], allowing them to produce the chemical in larger quantities. This success was met with several new problems. Lithium hydride was also in short supply, so Brown and Schlesinger needed to find a procedure that would allow them to use [[sodium hydride]] instead. They discovered that sodium hydride and [[methyl borate]] reacted to produce [[sodium trimethoxyborohydride]], which was viable as a substitute for the lithium hydride.<ref name="Lecture"/>

Soon they were informed that there was no longer a need for uranium borohydride, but it appeared that sodium borohydride could be useful in generating [[hydrogen]]. They began to look for a cheaper synthesis and discovered that adding methyl borate to sodium hydride at 250° produced sodium borohydride and sodium methoxide. When [[acetone]] was used in an attempt to separate the two products, it was discovered that sodium borohydride reduced the acetone.<ref name="Lecture"/>

Sodium borohydride is a mild [[reducing agent]] that works well in reducing aldehydes, ketones, and acid chlorides. Lithium aluminum hydride is a much more powerful reducing agent that can reduce almost any [[functional group]]. When Brown moved to [[Purdue University]] in 1947, he worked to find stronger [[borohydrides]] and milder [[aluminum hydride]]s that would provide a spectrum of reducing agents. The team of researchers at Purdue discovered that changing the metal ion of the borohydride to [[lithium]], [[magnesium]], or [[aluminum]] increases the reducing ability. They also found that introducing [[alkoxy]] substituents to the aluminum hydride decreases the reducing ability. They successfully developed a full spectrum of reducing agents.<ref name="Lecture"/>

[[File:Hydroboration-Oxidation.jpg|thumb|In [[hydroboration-oxidation]], the [[hydroxyl|OH group]] adds to the less-substituted carbon in the double bond.]] While researching these reducing agents, Brown's coworker, Dr. B. C. Subba Rao, discovered an unusual reaction between sodium borohydride and [[ethyl oleate]]. The borohydride added hydrogen and boron to the carbon-carbon [[double bond]] in the ethyl oleate. The organoborane product could then be [[redox|oxidized]] to form an alcohol.<ref name="Lecture"/> This two-step reaction is now called [[hydroboration-oxidation]] and is a reaction that converts [[alkenes]] into anti-Markovnikov alcohols. [[Markovnikov's rule]] states that, in adding hydrogen and a [[halide]] or [[hydroxyl]] group to a carbon-carbon double bond, the hydrogen is added to the less-substituted carbon of the bond and the hydroxyl or halide group is added to the more-substituted carbon of the bond. In hydroboration-oxidation, the opposite addition occurs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chem.ucla.edu/harding/IGOC/H/hydroboration_oxidation_reaction.html|title=Illustrated Glossary of Organic Chemistry - Hydroboration-oxidation reaction |website=www.chem.ucla.edu |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515084824/http://www.chem.ucla.edu/harding/IGOC/H/hydroboration_oxidation_reaction.html|archive-date=2014-05-15}}</ref>
