{{nihongo|'''Akira Suzuki'''|鈴木 章|Suzuki Akira|born September 12, 1930}} is a Japanese chemist and [[Nobel Prize Laureate]] (2010), who first published the [[Suzuki reaction]], the [[organic reaction]] of an [[aryl]]- or [[Vinyl group|vinyl]]-[[boronic acid]] with an aryl- or vinyl-[[halide]] catalyzed by a [[palladium|palladium(0)]] [[complex (chemistry)|complex]], in 1979.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Miyaura, Norio |author2=Yamada, Kinji |author3=Suzuki, Akira | year= 1979| title = A new stereospecific cross-coupling by the palladium-catalyzed reaction of 1-alkenylboranes with 1-alkenyl or 1-alkynyl halides| journal= Tetrahedron Letters| volume = 20| issue = 36| pages = 3437–3440| doi = 10.1016/S0040-4039(01)95429-2| url = http://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/handle/2115/44006| hdl = 2115/44006| hdl-access = free}}</ref><ref>Miyaura, N.; Suzuki, A.

==Early life and education==
Suzuki was born on September 12, 1930, in [[Mukawa, Hokkaidō]], his father died when he was in high school. He studied chemistry at [[Hokkaido University]] (Hokudai) and after receiving his [[PhD]] while he worked there as assistant professor. He initially wanted to major in [[mathematics]], his favorite subject in childhood was [[arithmetic]].<ref name=asasyo>『朝日小学生新聞』2010年10月8日</ref> It was an encounter with two books became an opportunity to advance to the path of [[organic synthesis]], one is ''Textbook of Organic Chemistry'' written by [[Louis Fieser]] of [[Harvard University]], and another is ''Hydroboration'' written by [[Herbert C. Brown]] of [[Purdue University]].<ref name=asahi/>

==Career==
From 1963 until 1965, Suzuki worked as a postdoctoral student with [[Herbert C. Brown]] at [[Purdue University]] and after returning to the Hokudai he became a full professor there. The postdoctoral experience was utilized in the study of the [[coupling reaction]] with his assistant [https://www.chem-station.com/chemist-db/archives/2009/08/-norio-miyaura.php Norio Miyaura] and led to the discovery of [[Suzuki reaction]] announced in 1979.<ref name="miyaura-mandai">{{Cite journal |id=和書 |author= 宮浦憲夫 |author2=萬代忠勝 |author-link =宮浦憲夫 |title= 辻二郎先生, 鈴木章先生日本学士院賞を受賞|date =2004 |publisher= 有機合成化学協会 |journal= 有機合成化学協会誌 |volume=62 |issue =5 |doi= 10.5059/yukigoseikyokaishi.62.410 |pages =410|doi-access=free }}</ref> Its organic [[boronic acids]] with [[aryl]] and [[vinyl group]] are stable to water and air, easy to handle, and because the conditions required for use are also relatively mild, even among the several cross-coupling techniques, it is said to be easy to use.<ref name=DB> [http://www.chem-station.com/chemist-db/archives/2007/09/akira-suzuki.php 世界の化学者データベース「鈴木章」]</ref> Its full mechanism is shown in the image below.

With his retirement from Hokudai in 1994 he took several positions in other universities: 1994–1995 [[Okayama University of Science]] and 1995–2002 [[Kurashiki University of Science and the Arts]].<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Miyaura, Norio |author2=Suzuki, Akira | year= 1995| title = Palladium-Catalyzed Cross-Coupling Reactions of Organoboron Compounds|journal= Chemical Reviews| volume = 95| issue = 7| pages = 2457–2483| doi = 10.1021/cr00039a007| url = http://eprints.lib.hokudai.ac.jp/dspace/handle/2115/44007}}</ref> In addition, he was an invited professor at Purdue University (2001), [[Academic Sinica]] and the [[National Taiwan University]] (2002).

In 2010, Suzuki was jointly awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel Prize for Chemistry]] together with [[Richard F. Heck]] and [[Ei-ichi Negishi]].<ref>{{cite press release |title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2010 |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2010/press.html |publisher=[[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] |date=October 6, 2010 |access-date=October 6, 2010}}</ref>

To celebrate International Year of Chemistry (IYC 2011), Suzuki was interviewed by the ''[[UNESCO Courier]]'' magazine, he said：
<blockquote>
Today some people see chemistry just as a polluting industry, but that is a mistake ... Without it, productivity would drop and we could not enjoy the life we know today. If there is pollution, it is because we are releasing harmful substances. Obviously, we have to adapt treatment and management regimes and work to develop chemical substances and manufacturing processes that respect the environment.<ref>http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0019/001906/190645e.pdf#nameddest=190724</ref>
</blockquote>

In 2014, a Canadian-Chinese student asked for Suzuki's advice: "how can I become a great chemist like you?", Suzuki answered him: "... above all else, you must learn to see through the appearance to perceive the essence."<ref>[https://www.zhihu.com/question/25670119/answer/31446220 为什么有些人很聪明？他们遇到问题时的思维方式与我们差别在哪呢？ - 知乎]</ref>

==Invention without patent==
Suzuki has not obtained a patent on [[Suzuki reaction]] technology because he thinks that the research was supported by government funds,<ref>『朝日新聞』2010年10月7日</ref> therefore coupling technology has become widespread, and many products using this technology have been put into practical use.<ref>{{cite news
