==Biography==
Adrian was born in [[Hampstead]], London, the youngest son of [[Alfred Douglas Adrian]], legal adviser to the [[Local Government Board]], and Flora Lavinia Barton.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.rse.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf|title=Former Fellows of The Royal Society of Edinburgh, 1783 – 2002: Biographical Index Part One|first1=C. D.|last1=Waterston|first2=A. Macmillan|last2=Shearer|date=2006|publisher=[[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]|page=7|isbn=090219884X}}</ref>

He was educated at [[Westminster School]] and then studied Natural Sciences at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], graduating in 1911. In 1913 he was elected to a fellowship of Trinity College on account of his research into the "all or none" law of nerves.

After completing a medical degree (MB BCh) in 1915, he undertook clinical work at [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]] London during [[World War I]], treating soldiers with nerve damage and nervous disorders such as [[shell shock]]. Adrian returned to Cambridge as a lecturer gaining his doctorate (MD) in 1919 and in 1925 began research on the human sensory organs by electrical methods.

===Career===
Continuing earlier studies of [[Keith Lucas (scientist)|Keith Lucas]], he used a [[capillary electrometer]] and [[cathode ray tube]] to amplify the signals produced by the [[nervous system]] and was able to record the electrical discharge of single nerve fibres under physical stimulus. (It seems he used frogs in his experiments<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1932/adrian/biographical | title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1932}}</ref>) An accidental discovery by Adrian in 1928 proved the presence of electricity within nerve cells. Adrian said,

<blockquote>I had arranged electrodes on the optic nerve of a toad in connection with some experiments on the retina. The room was nearly dark and I was puzzled to hear repeated noises in the loudspeaker attached to the amplifier, noises indicating that a great deal of impulse activity was going on. It was not until I compared the noises with my own movements around the room that I realised I was in the field of vision of the toad's eye and that it was signalling what I was doing.</blockquote>

A key result, published in 1928, stated that the excitation of the skin under constant stimulus is initially strong but gradually decreases over time, whereas the sensory impulses passing along the nerves from the point of contact are constant in strength, yet are reduced in frequency over time, and the sensation in the brain diminishes as a result.

Extending these results to the study of pain causes by the stimulus of the nervous system, he made discoveries about the reception of such signals in the brain and spatial distribution of the sensory areas of the [[cerebral cortex]] in different animals. These conclusions lead to the idea of a sensory map, called the [[homunculus]], in the [[somatosensory system]].

Later, Adrian used the [[electroencephalogram]] to study the electrical activity of the [[Human brain|brain in humans]]. His work on the abnormalities of the [[Hans Berger|Berger]] rhythm paved the way for subsequent investigation in [[epilepsy]] and other cerebral pathologies. He spent the last portion of his research career investigating [[olfaction]].

Positions that he held during his career included Foulerton Professor 1929–1937; Professor of Physiology in the [[University of Cambridge]] 1937–1951; [[Presidents of the Royal Society|President of the Royal Society]] 1950–1955; Master of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], 1951–1965; president of the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] 1960–1962; [[List of Chancellors of the University of Cambridge|Chancellor of the University of Cambridge]] 1967–1975; Chancellor of the [[University of Leicester]] 1957–1971. Adrian was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1938.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter A|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterA.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=6 April 2011}}</ref> In 1946 he became foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00001665 |title=Lord Edgar Douglas Adrian (1889–1977) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |access-date=2 August 2015}}</ref> In 1942 he was awarded membership to the [[Order of Merit]] and in 1955 was created [[Baron Adrian]], of Cambridge in the County of Cambridge.

He died in Cambridge and was given the honour of being buried in [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Edgar Douglas Adrian (1889-1977) - Find A Grave...|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/21629/edgar-douglas-adrian|access-date=2021-07-20|website=www.findagrave.com|language=en}}</ref>

==Family==

On 14 June 1923 Edgar Adrian married [[Hester Adrian|Hester Agnes Pinsent]], who was the daughter of [[Ellen Pinsent]] and sister of [[David Pinsent]].
Together they had three children, first a daughter and then [[mixed twins]]:
* Anne Pinsent Adrian, who married the physiologist [[Richard Keynes]], who was the great-grandson of [[Charles Darwin]]. The couple had four children.
: - Adrian Keynes (1946–1974)
: - [[Randal Keynes]] (*1948)
: - [[Roger Keynes]] (*1951) and
: - [[Simon Keynes]] (*1952)
* [[Richard Adrian, 2nd Baron Adrian]] (1927–1995)
: The couple had no children.
* Jennet Adrian (b. 1927), who married Peter Watson Campbell
