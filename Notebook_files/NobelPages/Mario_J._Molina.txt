==Discovery of harmful effects of CFCs==
In 1974, as a postdoctoral researcher at [[University of California, Irvine]], Molina and [[F. Sherwood Rowland]] co-authored a paper in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] ''highlighting the threat of CFCs to the ozone layer in the [[stratosphere]].<ref name="Molina">{{cite journal|author=Mario Molina and [[F.

Molina and Rowland followed up the short ''Nature'' paper with a 150-page report for the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|United States Atomic Energy Commission (AEC)]], which they made available at the September 1974 meeting of the [[American Chemical Society]] in [[Atlantic City]]. This report and an ACS-organized press conference, in which they called for a complete ban on further releases of CFCs into the atmosphere, brought national attention.<ref name="CC">{{cite journal|date=December 7, 1987|title=This Week's Citation Classic: Rowland F S & Molina M J.

Rowland and Molina's findings were disputed by commercial manufacturers and chemical industry groups, and a public consensus on the need for action only began to emerge in 1976 with the publication of a review of the science by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]. Rowland and Molina's work was further supported by evidence of the long-term decrease in stratospheric ozone over Antarctica, published by [[Joseph C. Farman]] and his co-authors in ''Nature'' in 1985. Ongoing work led to the adoption of the [[Montreal Protocol]] (an agreement to cut CFC production and use) by 56 countries in 1987, and to further steps towards the worldwide elimination of CFCs from aerosol cans and refrigerators. It is for this work that Molina later shared the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1995 with [[Paul J. Crutzen]] and [[F. Sherwood Rowland]].<ref name="Landmark">{{cite web|title=Chlorofluorocarbons and Ozone Depletion: A National Historic Chemical Landmark|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/cfcs-ozone.html|access-date=October 23, 2018|work=International Historic Chemical Landmarks|publisher=American Chemical Society|archive-date=December 31, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191231235259/https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/cfcs-ozone.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> The citation specifically recognized him and his co-awardees for "their work in atmospheric chemistry, particularly concerning the formation and decomposition of ozone."<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1995|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1995/summary/|access-date=October 8, 2020|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|archive-date=August 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810002846/https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1995/index.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Molina joined the lab of Professor F. Sherwood Rowland in 1973 as a postdoctoral fellow. Here, Molina continued Rowland's pioneering research into "hot atom" chemistry, which is the study of chemical properties of atoms with excess translational energy owing to radioactive processes.<ref name="Chemistry 1995 P 245-249" /><ref name="AOA" />

This study soon led to research into chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), apparently harmless gases that were used in refrigerants, aerosol sprays, and the making of plastic foams.<ref name="ScienceHistoryBio">{{cite web |title=Mario Molina |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/mario-molina |website=Science History Institute |access-date=October 25, 2018 |date=December 12, 2017 |archive-date=October 25, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181025190316/https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/mario-molina |url-status=dead }}</ref>  CFCs were being released by human activity and were known to be accumulating in the atmosphere. The basic scientific question Molina asked was "What is the consequence of society releasing something to the environment that wasn’t there before?"<ref name="AOA"/>

Rowland and Molina had investigated compounds similar to CFCs before. Together they developed the CFC ozone depletion theory, by combining basic scientific knowledge about the chemistry of ozone, CFCs and atmospheric conditions with computer modelling. First Molina tried to figure out how CFCs could be decomposed. At lower levels of the atmosphere, they were inert. Molina realized that if CFCs released into the atmosphere do not decay by other processes, they will continually rise to higher altitudes. Higher in the atmosphere, different conditions apply. The highest levels of the stratosphere are exposed to the sun's ultraviolet light. A thin layer of ozone floating high in the stratosphere protects lower levels of the atmosphere from that type of radiation.<ref name="ScienceHistoryBio"/>

Molina theorized that photons from ultraviolet light, known to break down oxygen molecules, could also break down CFCs,  releasing a number of products including [[chlorine]] atoms into the stratosphere. Chlorine atoms (Cl) are [[Radical (chemistry)|radicals]]: they have an unpaired electron and are very reactive. Chlorine atoms react easily with ozone molecules (O<sub>3</sub>), removing one oxygen atom to leave O<sub>2</sub> and [[chlorine monoxide]] (ClO).<ref name="ScienceHistoryBio"/><ref name="Wiberg">{{cite book |first1=Arnold Frederick|last1= Holleman|first2= Bernhard J. |last2=Aylett|first3= William|last3= Brewer |first4=Mary |last4=Eagleson|first5= Egon|last5= Wiberg |title=Inorganic chemistry |date=2001 |publisher=Academic Press |edition=1st English| page= 462}}</ref>

:Cl· + {{chem|O|3}} → ClO· + {{chem|O|2}}

ClO is also a radical, which reacts with ozone to release two O<sub>2</sub> molecules and a Cl atom. The radical Cl atom is not consumed in these reactions, so it remains in the system.<ref name="ScienceHistoryBio"/><ref name="Wiberg"/>

:ClO· + O· → Cl· + {{chem|O|2}}

Molina and Rowland predicted that chlorine atoms, produced by this decomposition of CFCs, would act as an ongoing catalyst for the destruction of ozone. When they calculated the amounts involved they realized that CFCs could start a seriously damaging chain reaction to the ozone layer in the stratosphere.<ref name="Landmark"/><ref name="Chemistry 1995 P 245-249"/><ref name="AOA"/>

Rowland and Molina published their findings in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' on June 28, 1974, and also made an effort to announce their findings outside of the scientific community, informing policy makers and the news media of their work. As a result of their work, laws were established to protect the ozone layer by regulating the use of CFCs.<ref name="Chemistry 1995 P 245-249"/><ref name="AOA">{{cite web|title=Mario J.
