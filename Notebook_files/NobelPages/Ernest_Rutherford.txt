Rutherford became Director of the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge in 1919. Under his leadership the [[neutron]] was discovered by [[James Chadwick]] in 1932 and in the same year the first experiment to split the nucleus in a fully controlled manner was performed by students working under his direction, [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]]. After his death in 1937, he was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]] near [[Sir Isaac Newton]]. The chemical element [[rutherfordium]] (element 104) was named after him in 1997.

[[File:Ernest Rutherford 1905.jpg|thumb|upright=1.6|left|Ernest Rutherford at [[McGill University]] in 1905]]
At Cambridge, Rutherford started to work with [[J. J. Thomson]] on the conductive effects of X-rays on gases, work which led to the discovery of the [[electron]] which Thomson presented to the world in 1897. Hearing of [[Henri Becquerel|Becquerel]]'s experience with [[uranium]], Rutherford started to explore its [[radioactivity]], discovering two types that differed from X-rays in their penetrating power. Continuing his research in Canada, he coined the terms [[alpha ray]] and [[beta ray]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Trenn|first=Thaddeus J.|date=1976|title=Rutherford on the Alpha-Beta-Gamma Classification of Radioactive Rays|journal=Isis|volume=67|issue=1|pages=61–75|jstor=231134|doi=10.1086/351545|s2cid=145281124}}</ref> in 1899 to describe the two distinct types of [[radioactivity|radiation]]. He then discovered that [[thorium]] gave off a gas which produced an emanation which was itself radioactive and would coat other substances.<ref>{{Cite arxiv|last=Kragh|first=Helge|date=2012-02-05|title=Rutherford, Radioactivity, and the Atomic Nucleus|eprint=1202.0954|class=physics.hist-ph}}</ref> He found that a sample of this radioactive material of any size invariably took the same amount of time for half the sample to decay – its "[[half-life]]" (11½ minutes in this case).

From 1900 to 1903, he was joined at McGill by the young chemist [[Frederick Soddy]] ([[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]], 1921) for whom he set the problem of identifying the thorium emanations. Once he had eliminated all the normal chemical reactions, Soddy suggested that it must be one of the inert gases, which they named [[thoron]] (later found to be an isotope of [[radon]]). They also found another type of thorium they called Thorium X, and kept on finding traces of helium. They also worked with samples of "Uranium X" from [[William Crookes]] and [[radium]] from [[Marie Curie]].

In 1903, they published their "Law of Radioactive Change", to account for all their experiments. Until then, atoms were assumed to be the indestructible basis of all matter and although Curie had suggested that radioactivity was an atomic phenomenon, the idea of the atoms of radioactive substances breaking up was a radically new idea. Rutherford and Soddy demonstrated that radioactivity involved the spontaneous disintegration of atoms into other, as yet, unidentified matter. The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1908 was awarded to Ernest Rutherford "for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances".<ref>{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1908 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1908/summary/ |website=The Nobel Prize |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref>

In 1903, Rutherford considered a type of radiation discovered (but not named) by French chemist [[Paul Villard]] in 1900, as an emission from [[radium]], and realised that this observation must represent something different from his own alpha and beta rays, due to its very much greater penetrating power. Rutherford therefore gave this third type of radiation the name of [[gamma ray]]. All three of Rutherford's terms are in standard use today – other types of [[radioactive decay]] have since been discovered, but Rutherford's three types are among the most common.

In 1904, Rutherford suggested that radioactivity provides a source of energy sufficient to explain the existence of the Sun for the many millions of years required for the slow biological evolution on Earth proposed by biologists such as [[Charles Darwin]]. The physicist Lord Kelvin had argued earlier for a much younger Earth (see also [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin#Age of the Earth: geology]]) based on the insufficiency of known energy sources, but Rutherford pointed out at a lecture attended by Kelvin that radioactivity could solve this problem.<ref name="England et al 2007">{{cite journal |author1=England, P. |author2=Molnar, P. |author3=Righter, F. | title=John Perry's neglected critique of Kelvin's age for the Earth: A missed opportunity in geodynamics |journal=GSA Today |date=January 2007 |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=4–9 |doi=10.1130/GSAT01701A.1 |doi-access= free}}</ref>

In Manchester, he continued to work with alpha radiation. In conjunction with [[Hans Geiger]], he developed zinc sulfide [[zinc sulfide|scintillation screens]] and [[ionisation chamber]]s to count alphas. By dividing the total charge they produced by the number counted, Rutherford decided that the charge on the alpha was two. In late 1907, Ernest Rutherford and [[Thomas Royds]] allowed alphas to penetrate a very thin window into an evacuated tube. As they [[atomic emission spectroscopy|sparked the tube into discharge]], the spectrum obtained from it changed, as the alphas accumulated in the tube. Eventually, the clear spectrum of helium gas appeared, proving that alphas were at least ionised helium atoms, and probably helium nuclei.

===Gold foil experiment===
[[File:Gold foil experiment conclusions.svg|right|thumb|''Top:'' Expected results: [[alpha particle]]s passing through the [[plum pudding model]] of the atom undisturbed.<br/>
''Bottom:'' Observed results: a small portion of the particles were deflected, indicating [[Atomic nucleus|a small, concentrated charge]]. Diagram is not to scale; in reality the nucleus is vastly smaller than the electron shell.]]
Rutherford performed his most famous work after receiving the Nobel prize in 1908. Along with [[Hans Geiger]] and [[Ernest Marsden]] in 1909, he carried out the [[Geiger–Marsden experiment]], which demonstrated the nuclear nature of atoms by deflecting [[alpha particles]] passing through a thin gold foil. Rutherford was inspired to ask Geiger and Marsden in this experiment to look for alpha particles with very high deflection angles, of a type not expected from any theory of matter at that time. Such deflections, though rare, were found, and proved to be a smooth but high-order function of the deflection angle. It was Rutherford's interpretation of this data that led him to formulate the [[Rutherford model]] of the atom in 1911{{snd}}that a very small [[charge (physics)|charged]]<ref name=charge /> [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]], containing much of the atom's mass, was [[orbit]]ed by low-mass [[electron]]s.

In 1919–1920, Rutherford found that nitrogen and other light elements ejected a proton, which he called a "hydrogen atom", when hit with α (alpha) particles.<ref>{{cite web |title=Atop the Physics Wave: Rutherford back in Cambridge, 1919–1937 |url=http://history.aip.org/history/exhibits/rutherford/sections/atop-physics-wave.html |website=Rutherford's Nuclear World: The Story of the Discovery of the Nucleus |publisher=American Institute of Physics |access-date=25 June 2018}}</ref> This result showed Rutherford that hydrogen nuclei were a part of nitrogen nuclei (and by inference, probably other nuclei as well). Such a construction had been suspected for many years on the basis of atomic weights which were whole numbers of that of hydrogen; see [[Prout's hypothesis]]. Hydrogen was known to be the lightest element, and its nuclei presumably the lightest nuclei. Now, because of all these considerations, Rutherford decided that a hydrogen nucleus was possibly a fundamental building block of all nuclei, and also possibly a new fundamental particle as well, since nothing was known from the nucleus that was lighter. Thus, confirming and extending the work of [[Wilhelm Wien]] who in 1898 discovered the proton in streams of [[ionized gas]],<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1002/andp.18943180404|title = Über positive Elektronen und die Existenz hoher Atomgewichte|journal = Annalen der Physik|volume = 318|issue = 4|pages = 669–677|year = 1904|last1 = Wien|first1 = W.|bibcode = 1904AnP...318..669W|url = https://zenodo.org/record/2190505}}</ref> Rutherford postulated the hydrogen nucleus to be a new particle in 1920, which he dubbed the ''[[proton]]''.

In 1921, while working with [[Niels Bohr]] (who postulated that electrons moved in specific orbits), Rutherford theorized about the existence of [[neutron]]s, (which he had christened in his 1920 [[Bakerian Lecture]]), which could somehow compensate for the repelling effect of the positive charges of [[proton]]s by causing an attractive [[nuclear force]] and thus keep the nuclei from flying apart from the repulsion between protons. The only alternative to neutrons was the existence of "nuclear electrons" which would counteract some of the proton charges in the nucleus, since by then it was known that nuclei had about twice the mass that could be accounted for if they were simply assembled from hydrogen nuclei (protons). But how these nuclear electrons could be trapped in the nucleus, was a mystery.

Rutherford is widely quoted as saying, regarding the results of these experiments: "It was quite the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life. It was almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper and it came back and hit you."<ref> [https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191826719.001.0001/q-oro-ed4-00009051 Oxford Essential Quotations (4th ed.), 2016], which cites E. N. da C. Andrade, ''Rutherford and the Nature of the Atom'' (1964) </ref>

Rutherford's theory of [[neutron]]s was proved in 1932 by his associate [[James Chadwick]], who recognized neutrons immediately when they were produced by other scientists and later himself, in bombarding beryllium with alpha particles. In 1935, Chadwick was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery.

Rutherford is considered to have been among the greatest scientists in history. At the opening session of the 1938 Indian Science Congress, which Rutherford had been expected to preside over before his death, astrophysicist [[James Jeans]] spoke in his place and deemed him "one of the greatest scientists of all time", saying:

{{quote|In his flair for the right line of approach to a problem, as well as in the simple directness of his methods of attack, [Rutherford] often reminds us of Faraday, but he had two great advantages which Faraday did not possess, first, exuberant bodily health and energy, and second, the opportunity and capacity to direct a band of enthusiastic co-workers. Great though Faraday's output of work was, it seems to me that to match Rutherford's work in quantity as well as in quality, we must go back to Newton. In some respects he was more fortunate than Newton. Rutherford was ever the happy warrior – happy in his work, happy in its outcome, and happy in its human contacts.<ref>{{cite news |title=Viceroy Opens The Congress – Sir James Jeans's Address|work=The Times |location=Calcutta |date=3 January 1938 }}</ref>}}

===Nuclear physics===
[[File:IPT-plasma-jet.jpg|thumb|nitrogen plasma]]
Rutherford's research, and work done under him as laboratory director, established the nuclear structure of the atom and the essential nature of radioactive decay as a nuclear process. [[Patrick Blackett]], a research fellow working under Rutherford, using natural alpha particles, demonstrated ''induced'' [[nuclear transmutation]]. Rutherford's team later, using protons from an accelerator, demonstrated ''artificially-induced'' nuclear reactions and transmutation. He is known as the father of nuclear physics. Rutherford died too early to see [[Leó Szilárd]]'s idea of controlled [[nuclear chain reaction]]s come into being. However, a speech of Rutherford's about his artificially-induced transmutation in lithium, printed on 12 September 1933 London paper ''[[The Times]]'', was reported by Szilárd to have been his inspiration for thinking of the possibility of a controlled energy-producing [[nuclear chain reaction]]. Szilard had this idea while walking in London, on the same day.

Rutherford's speech touched on the 1932 work of his students [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]] in "splitting" lithium into alpha particles by bombardment with protons from a particle accelerator they had constructed. Rutherford realized that the energy released from the split lithium atoms was enormous, but he also realized that the energy needed for the accelerator, and its essential inefficiency in splitting atoms in this fashion, made the project an impossibility as a practical source of energy (accelerator-induced fission of light elements remains too inefficient to be used in this way, even today). Rutherford's speech in part, read:

{{quote|We might in these processes obtain very much more energy than the proton supplied, but on the average we could not expect to obtain energy in this way. It was a very poor and inefficient way of producing energy, and anyone who looked for a source of power in the transformation of the atoms was talking moonshine. But the subject was scientifically interesting because it gave insight into the atoms.<ref>[http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/ The Times archives], 12 September 1933, "The British association – breaking down the atom"</ref>}}
