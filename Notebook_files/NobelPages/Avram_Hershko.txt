'''Avram Hershko''' ({{lang-he|אברהם הרשקו|Avraham Hershko}}, {{lang-hu|Herskó Ferenc Ábrahám}};<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mta.hu/articles/hungarys_nobel_prize_winners__25577|title=Hungary's Nobel Prize Winners|website=www.mta.hu|accessdate=22 September 2021|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006113721/http://mta.hu/articles/hungarys_nobel_prize_winners__25577|archivedate=6 October 2015}}</ref> born December 31, 1937) is an Israeli [[biology|biochemist]] of [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Hungarian Jewish]] origin who received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 2004.

==Biography==
He was born '''Herskó Ferenc''' in [[Karcag]], [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungary]], the son of Shoshana/Margit 'Manci' (née Wulc) and Moshe Hershko, both teachers.<ref name="Nobel">{{Nobelprize}} including the Nobel Lecture ''The Ubiquitin System for Protein Degradation and some of its Roles in the Control of the Cell Division Cycle''</ref>
During the [[World War II|Second World War]], his father was forced into [[Labour service in Hungary during World War II|labor service in the Hungarian army]] and then taken as a prisoner by the [[Soviet Army]]. For years, Avram's family didn't known anything about what had happened to his father. Avram, his mother and older brother were put in a [[ghetto]] in [[Szolnok]]. During the final days of the ghetto, most Jews were sent to their deaths in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], but Avram and his family managed to board trains that took them to a [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camp]] in [[Austria under National Socialism|Austria]], where they were forced into labor until the end of the war. Avram and his mother survived the war and returned to their home. His father returned as well, 4 years after they had last seen him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yadvashem.org/he/remembrance/survivors/hershko.html|title=אברהם הרשקו}}</ref>

Hershko and his family emigrated to [[Israel]] in 1950 and settled in [[Jerusalem]]. He received his M.D. in 1965 and his Ph.D in 1969 from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]-[[Hadassah Medical Center]].  He is currently a Distinguished Professor at the Rappaport Faculty of Medicine at the [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology|Technion]] in [[Haifa]] and a Distinguished Adjunct Professor at the [[New York University Grossman School of Medicine]].

Along with [[Aaron Ciechanover]] and [[Irwin Rose]], he was awarded the 2004 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for the discovery of [[ubiquitin]]-mediated [[Proteolysis#Protein degradation|protein degradation]]. The ubiquitin-[[proteasome]] system has a critical role in maintaining the homeostasis of cells and is believed to be involved in the development and progression of diseases such as cancer, muscular and neurological diseases, and immune and inflammatory responses.

His contributions to science directly helped cure one of his long-time friends of cancer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phillyburbs.com/news/local/burlington_county_times_news/nobel-prize-winner-s-discovery-helps-save-longtime-physician-friend/article_9ad53d9b-22f5-5fec-8956-92a7aae6a009.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120913041804/http://www.phillyburbs.com/news/local/burlington_county_times_news/nobel-prize-winner-s-discovery-helps-save-longtime-physician-friend/article_9ad53d9b-22f5-5fec-8956-92a7aae6a009.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 13, 2012 |title=Nobel Prize winner's discovery helps save longtime physician friend |date=September 13, 2011 |first=Sally |last=Friedman |work=[[Burlington County Times]] |publisher=phillyBurbs.com |access-date=May 15, 2012 }}</ref>
