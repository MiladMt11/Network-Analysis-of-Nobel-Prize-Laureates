'''Hartmut Michel''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhaʁtmuːt ˈmɪçl̩|-|De-Hartmut Michel.ogg}}; born 18 July 1948) is a [[Germany|German]] [[biochemist]], who received the 1988 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for determination of the first crystal structure of an integral membrane protein, a membrane-bound complex of proteins and co-factors that is essential to [[photosynthesis]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/1988/michel-autobio.html|title=Autobiographical information on Hartmut at www.nobel.org|accessdate=4 October 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfb807.de/hartmut-michel.html|title=P3 Hartmut Michel|website=www.sfb807.de}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/376660a0| pmid = 7651515| title = Structure at 2.8 Å resolution of cytochrome c oxidase from Paracoccus denitrificans| journal = Nature| volume = 376| issue = 6542| pages = 660–9| year = 1995| last1 = Iwata | first1 = S. | last2 = Ostermeier | first2 = C. | last3 = Ludwig | first3 = B. | last4 = Michel | first4 = H. | bibcode = 1995Natur.376..660I| s2cid = 4345523}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0022-2836(84)80011-X| pmid = 6392571| title = X-ray structure analysis of a membrane protein complex| journal = Journal of Molecular Biology| volume = 180| issue = 2| pages = 385–98| year = 1984| last1 = Deisenhofer | first1 = J.| last2 = Epp | first2 = O.| last3 = Miki | first3 = K.| last4 = Huber | first4 = R.| last5 = Michel | first5 = H.}}</ref>

==Education and early life==
He was born on 18 July 1948 in [[Ludwigsburg]]. After compulsory military service, he studied biochemistry at the [[University of Tübingen]], working for his final year at Dieter Oesterhelt's laboratory on [[ATPase]] activity of [[halobacteria]].

==Career and research==
Hartmut later{{when|date=October 2015}} worked on the crystallisation of [[membrane protein]]s - essential for their structure elucidation by [[X-ray crystallography]]. He received the [[Nobel Prize]] jointly with [[Johann Deisenhofer]] and [[Robert Huber]] in 1988. Together with Michel and Huber, Deisenhofer determined the three-dimensional structure of a protein complex found in certain photosynthetic bacteria. This membrane protein complex, called a [[photosynthetic reaction center]], was known to play a crucial role in initiating a simple type of photosynthesis. Between 1982 and 1985, the three scientists used [[X-ray crystallography]] to determine the exact arrangement of the more than 10,000 atoms that make up the protein complex. Their research increased the general understanding of the mechanisms of photosynthesis, revealed similarities between the photosynthetic processes of plants and bacteria and established a methodology for crystallising membrane proteins.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/318618a0| pmid = 22439175| title = Structure of the protein subunits in the photosynthetic reaction centre of Rhodopseudomonas viridis at 3Å resolution| journal = Nature| volume = 318| issue = 6047| pages = 618–24| year = 1985| last1 = Deisenhofer | first1 = J.| author-link1 = Johann Deisenhofer| last2 = Epp | first2 = O.| last3 = Miki | first3 = K.| last4 = Huber | first4 = R.| author-link4 = Robert Huber| last5 = Michel | first5 = H.| author-link5 = Hartmut Michel| bibcode = 1985Natur.318..618D| s2cid = 1551692}}</ref>

Since 1987 he has been director of the Molecular Membrane Biology department at
the [[Max Planck Institute for Biophysics]] in [[Frankfurt|Frankfurt am Main]], Germany, and professor of biochemistry at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt]].

==Awards and honours==
In 1986, he received the [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz Prize]] of the [[Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft]], which is the highest honour awarded in German research. In 1988, he received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]. He received the Bijvoet Medal at the [[Bijvoet Center for Biomolecular Research]] of [[Utrecht University]] in 1989.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bijvoet-center.eu/bijvoet-medal/|title=Bijvoet Medal|publisher=Bijvoet Center for Biomolecular Research|access-date=2017-09-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912191415/http://bijvoet-center.eu/bijvoet-medal/|archive-date=12 September 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1995 he became a member of the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]].<ref>{{cite web |title= Hartmut Michel |url=https://www.leopoldina.org/mitgliederverzeichnis/mitglieder/member/Member/show/hartmut-michel/|publisher=German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina |access-date=1 June 2021}}</ref> He also became a foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/foreign-members/4549 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213195237/https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/foreign-members/4549 |title=H.
