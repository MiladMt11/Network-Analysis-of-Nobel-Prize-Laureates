'''John O'Keefe''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FRS|FMedSci}} (born November 18, 1939) is an American-British [[neuroscientist]], [[psychologist]] and a [[professor]] at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre for Neural Circuits and Behaviour and the Research Department of Cell and Developmental Biology at [[University College London]]. He discovered [[place cell]]s in the [[hippocampus]], and that they show a specific kind of [[temporal coding]] in the form of [[Theta wave|theta]] [[phase precession]]. He shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 2014, together with [[May-Britt Moser]] and [[Edvard Moser]]; he has received several other awards. He has worked at University College London for his entire career, but also held a part-time chair at the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] at the behest of his Norwegian collaborators, the Mosers.

==Education and early life==
Born in New York City to Irish immigrant parents, O'Keefe attended [[Regis High School (New York City)|Regis High School]] (Manhattan) and received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] degree from the [[City College of New York]].<ref name="Bio" /><ref>{{cite news |title=John O'Keefe, Class of '63, Wins Nobel Prize |url=http://www.ccny.cuny.edu/news/nobel-laureate.cfm |access-date=8 October 2014 |publisher=The City College of New York |date=6 October 2014}}</ref> He went on to study at [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]],  Canada, where he obtained an [[Master of Arts|MA]] degree in 1964, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in Psychology in 1967, supervised by [[Ronald Melzack]].<ref>{{cite web |title=John O'Keefe |url=http://www.kavliprize.org/prizes-and-laureates/laureates/john-o'keefe |website=Kavli Prize |publisher=Kavli Foundation |access-date=11 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=McGill grad John O'Keefe wins Nobel Prize in medicine |url=https://www.mcgill.ca/research/channels/news/mcgill-grad-john-o%E2%80%99keefe-wins-nobel-prize-medicine-239350 |access-date=8 October 2014 |publisher=Media Relations Office of McGill University |date=6 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite thesis |last1=O'Keefe |first1=John |title=Response properties of amygdalar units in the freely moving cat |url=http://digitool.Library.McGill.CA:80/R/-?func=dbin-jump-full&object_id=70142&silo_library=GEN01 |type=Ph.D. |publisher=McGill University |date=1967 |place=Montreal, Quebec, Canada |oclc=894987156}}</ref>

==Career and research==
O'Keefe went to [[University College London]] in 1967 as a US [[National Institute of Mental Health|NIMH]] [[postdoctoral research]] fellow working with the late [[Patrick David Wall|Patrick Wall]]. He has been there ever since and was promoted to Professor in 1987. At the behest of his collaborators [[Edvard Moser]] and [[May-Britt Moser]] he was appointed to a part-time professorial chair at the [[Norwegian University of Science and Technology]] in 2014.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.adressa.no/nyheter/trondheim/article10430269.ece | title=NTNU ansetter nobelprisvinner O'Keefe| date=2014-12-08}}</ref>

===Discovery of place cells===
{{see also|Place cell}}
O’Keefe and his student Jonathan Dostrovsky discovered place cells by systematically analyzing the environmental factors influencing the firing properties of individual hippocampal neurons.<ref name="OKeefe1971" /><ref name="OKeefe1976" /> His many publications on place cells have been highly cited. In addition, he published an influential book with [[Lynn Nadel]], proposing the functional role of the [[hippocampus]] as a [[cognitive map]] for [[spatial memory]] function.<ref name="Book" /> In extensions of his work, place cells have been analyzed experimentally or simulated in models in hundreds of papers.<ref name="ReviewOKeefe" /><ref name="ReviewBest" /><ref name="ReviewMoser" />

===Discovery of theta phase precession===
In further research on place cells, O’Keefe found evidence for a distinctive variation of [[temporal coding]] of information by the timing of [[action potential]]s in place cells, relative to an oscillatory [[Electroencephalography|EEG]] cycle known as the [[theta rhythm]], as opposed to spike timing within a single cell. In a 1993 paper, he and Michael Recce demonstrated that place cells spike at different phases relative to theta rhythm oscillations in the local field potential of the hippocampus.<ref name="OKeefe1993" /> As a rat enters the firing field of a place cell, the spiking starts at late phases of theta rhythm, and as the rat moves through the firing field, the spikes shift to earlier phases of the theta cycle. This effect has been replicated in numerous subsequent papers, providing evidence for the coding of sensory input by the timing of spikes. Numerous models have addressed the potential physiological mechanisms of theta phase precession.

===Prediction and discovery of boundary vector cells===
{{see also|Boundary cell}}
In a paper in 1996, O'Keefe and [[Neil Burgess (neuroscientist)|Neil Burgess]] presented data showing shifts in the position and size of place cell firing fields when the barriers defining the environment were shifted.<ref name="OKeefe1996" /> In this and subsequent papers, they presented a model of this phenomenon predicting the existence of boundary vector cells that would respond at a specific distance from barriers in the environment.<ref name="Hartley2000" /> Several years later, this explicit theoretical prediction was supported by extensive experimental data demonstrating [[boundary cell]]s with the predicted properties in the [[subiculum]]<ref name="Lever2009" /> and the medial [[entorhinal cortex]] (where they are sometimes referred to as border cells).
