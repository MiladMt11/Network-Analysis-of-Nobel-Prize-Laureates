'''Rolf Martin Zinkernagel''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|ACh,|FAA}} (born 6 January 1944) is Professor of Experimental [[Immunology]] at the [[University of Zurich]]. He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1996 for the discovery of how the [[immune system]] recognizes virus-infected cells.

==Education==
Zinkernagel received his [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] degree from the [[University of Basel]] in 1970 and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from the [[Australian National University]] in 1975.<ref name=phd>{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Rolf|last=Zinkernagel |title=The role of the H-2 gene complex in cell-mediated immunity to viral and bacterial infections in mice |publisher=Australian National University |date=1975 |url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/version/9518103 }}</ref>

==Career and research==
Zinkernagel is a member of the Cancer Research Institute Scientific Advisory Council, the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Rolf Martin Zinkernagel|url=https://www.amacad.org/person/rolf-martin-zinkernagel|access-date=2021-10-11|website=American Academy of Arts & Sciences|language=en}}</ref> The [[National Academy of Sciences]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Rolf M.

Zinkernagel was elected as a Corresponding Fellow to the [[Australian Academy of Science]] also in 1996. 

==Awards and honours==
Together with the [[Australia]]n [[Peter C. Doherty]] he received the 1996 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for the discovery of how the [[immune system]] recognizes virus-infected cells.  With this he became the 24th Swiss [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureate]]. In 1999 he was awarded an honorary Companion of the [[Order of Australia]] (AC), Australia's highest civilian honour, for his scientific work with Doherty.<ref>[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=883312&search_type=simple&showInd=true It's an Honour: AC]</ref> 

Viruses infect host cells and reproduce inside them. Killer T-cells destroy those infected cells so that the viruses can't reproduce. Zinkernagel and Doherty discovered that, in order for killer T-cells to recognize infected cells, they had to recognize two molecules on the surface of the cell—not only the virus antigen, but also a molecule of the [[major histocompatibility complex]] (MHC). This recognition was done by a T-cell receptor on the surface of the T-cell. The MHC was previously identified as being responsible for the rejection of incompatible tissues during transplantation. Zinkernagel and Doherty discovered that the MHC was responsible for the body fighting meningitis viruses too.<ref name="Nobel">{{Nobelprize}} including the Nobel Lecture  December 1996 ''Cellular Immune Recognition and the Biological Role of Major Transplantation Antigens''</ref>

In addition to the Nobel Prize, he also won the [[Cloëtta Prize]] in 1981, the Cancer Research Institute [[William B. Coley Award]] in 1987, the [[Otto-Naegeli-Preis]] in 1988 and the [[Albert Lasker Medical Research Award]] in 1995. In 1994 he became a member of the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]].<ref>{{cite web |title= Rolf M.
