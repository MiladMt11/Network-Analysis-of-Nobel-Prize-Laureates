{{Nihongo|'''Syukuro "Suki" Manabe '''|真鍋 淑郎|Manabe Shukurō|born 21 September 1931}} is a  Japanese-educated American [[meteorologist]] and [[climatologist]] who pioneered the use of [[computer]]s to [[computer simulation|simulate]] global [[climate change]] and [[Climate variability and change|natural climate variations]]. He was awarded half of the 2021 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], jointly with [[Klaus Hasselmann]], for his contributions to the [[Climate model|physical modeling of earth's climate]], quantifying its variability, and predictions of climate change.

== Early life and education ==
Born in 1931 in [[:ja:新立村|Shinritsu Village]], [[Uma District, Ehime|Uma District]], [[Ehime Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. Both his grandfather and his father were physicians, who operated the only clinic in the village.<ref name="Asahi 20211005">{{cite news |last=Nagata |first=Yutaka |date= October 5, 2021 |title=真鍋淑郎さんの地元・愛媛も喜び 小学校の同級生「夢みたい」  |trans-title=Syuro Manabe's hometown in Ehime rejoices, elementary school classmate says 'Feels like a dream' |url=https://www.asahi.com/articles/ASPB56DS6PB5PTLC00P.html |language=Japanese |work=Asahi Shinbun Digital |location=Tokyo |access-date=October 5, 2021}} Easier to access at [Yahoo mirror site https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/04e7a8f6d96a5694121d438ec1d19c86a3ec6eeb].</ref> A classmate recalled that, even in elementary school, he was already "interested in the weather, making comments such as 'If Japan didn't have [[typhoon]]s, we wouldn't have so much rain.'"<ref name="Asahi 20211005"/> Manabe attended [[Ehime Prefectural Mishima High School]].

== Career ==
After finishing his doctorate, Manabe went to the United States to work at the General Circulation Research Section of the U.S. Weather Bureau, now the [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory]] of [[NOAA]], continuing until 1997. From 1997 to 2001, he worked at the Frontier Research System for
Global Change in Japan serving as Director of the Global Warming Research Division. In 2002 he returned to the United States as a visiting research collaborator at the Program in Atmospheric and Oceanic Science, [[Princeton University]]. He currently serves as senior meteorologist at the university.<ref name="Princeton University 2021">{{cite web | title=Princeton's Syukuro Manabe receives Nobel Prize in physics | website=Princeton University | date=2021-10-05 | url=https://www.princeton.edu/news/2021/10/05/princetons-syukuro-manabe-receives-nobel-prize-physics | access-date=2021-10-06}}</ref> He also engaged as a specially invited professor at [[Nagoya University]] from December 2007 to March 2014.<ref name="Nagoya University 2021">{{cite web | title=真鍋 淑郎 元名古屋大学特別招へい教授が、2021年ノーベル物理学賞を受賞しました | website=Nagoya University | date=2021-10-06 | url=https://www.nagoya-u.ac.jp/info/20211005_jimu.html | access-date=2021-10-06}}</ref>

== Scientific accomplishments ==
Working at [[NOAA]]'s [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory]], first in [[Washington, DC]] and later in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], Manabe worked with director [[Joseph Smagorinsky]] to develop [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] [[Model (abstract)|models]] of the [[atmosphere]].<ref name="Gent pp. 54–55">{{cite journal | last=Gent | first=Peter R. | title=Modeling the future of Earth's climate | journal=Physics Today | publisher=AIP Publishing | volume=73 | issue=9 | date=1 September 2020 | issn=0031-9228 | doi=10.1063/pt.3.4571 | pages=54–55| bibcode=2020PhT....73i..54G | doi-access=free }}</ref> As the first step, Manabe and Wetherald (1967) developed one-dimensional, single-column model of the atmosphere in radiative-convective equilibrium with positive feedback effect of water vapor.<ref name="Atmospheric &amp; Oceanic Sciences 2017">{{cite web | title=In Retrospect (Nature): Highlights a Classic 1967 Paper by Manabe and Wetherald | website=Atmospheric & Oceanic Sciences | date=2017-05-18 | url=https://aos.princeton.edu/news/retrospect-nature-highlights-classic-1967-paper-manabe-and-wetherald | access-date=2021-10-06}}</ref> Using the model, they found that, in response to the change in atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide, the temperature increases at the Earth's surface and in the troposphere, whereas it decreases in the stratosphere. The development of the radiative-convective model was a critically important step towards the development of comprehensive general circulation model of the atmosphere (Manabe et al. 1965). They used the model to simulate for the first time the three-dimensional response of temperature and the hydrologic cycle to increased carbon dioxide (Manabe and Wetherald, 1975). In 1969 Manabe and Bryan published the first simulations of the climate by a coupled ocean-atmosphere models, in which the general circulation model of the atmosphere is combined with that of ocean. 
   
Throughout the 1990s early 2000s, Manabe's research group published seminal papers using the coupled atmosphere ocean models to investigate the time-dependent response of [[climate]] to changing [[greenhouse gas]] concentrations of the atmosphere (Stouffer et al., 1989; Manabe et al., 1991 & 1992). They also applied the model to the study of past climate change, including the role of freshwater input to the North Atlantic Ocean as a potential cause of the so-called, [[abrupt climate change]] evident in the paleoclimatic record (Manabe and Stouffer, 1995 & 2000).<ref>Manabe, S. and A.

Manabe is a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], and a foreign member of Japan Academy, [[Academia Europaea]] and the [[Royal Society of Canada]].<ref name="National Academy of Sciences 2021">{{cite web | title=title | website=National Academy of Sciences | date=23 February 2021 | url=http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/members/52989.html | access-date=5 October 2021}}</ref>

In 1992, Manabe was the first recipient of the Blue Planet Prize of the Asahi Glass Foundation. In 1995, he received the Asahi Prize from Asahi News-Cultural Foundation. In 1997 Manabe was awarded the Volvo Environmental Prize from the Volvo Foundation.

Manabe has also been honored with the [[American Meteorological Society]]’s [[Carl-Gustaf Rossby Research Medal]], the Second Half Century Award, and Meisinger Award. In addition, he is honored with the [[American Geophysical Union]]’s William Bowie Medal and Revelle Medal, and in 1998 received the [[Milutin Milankovic Medal]] from the [[European Geophysical Society]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.egu.eu/awards-medals/milutin-milankovic/ |title= EGU – Awards & medals – Milutin Milankovic Medal |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= |publisher= European Geosciences Union |access-date= 18 May 2018 |quote=}}</ref>

Manabe and Bryan's work in the development of the first [[global climate model]]s has been selected as one of the Top Ten Breakthroughs to have occurred in [[NOAA]]'s first 200 years.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://celebrating200years.noaa.gov/breakthroughs/climate_model/welcome.html#testing | title=Breakthrough article on the First Climate Model|website=Celebrating200years.noaa.gov}}</ref> In honor of his retirement from [[NOAA]] / [[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory|GFDL]], a three-day scientific meeting was held in [[Princeton, New Jersey]] in March 1998. It was titled "Understanding Climate Change: A Symposium in honor of Syukuro Manabe".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/aboutus/symposium/manabe/index.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 February 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050408082540/http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/aboutus/symposium/manabe/index.html |archive-date=8 April 2005 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The 2005 annual meeting of [[American Meteorological Society]] included a special Suki Manabe Symposium.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ams.confex.com/ams/Annual2005/techprogram/program_259.htm#Session17310|title=The Suki Manabe Symposium (Compact View)|website=Ams.confex.com|access-date=6 July 2016}}</ref>

Jointly Manabe with climatologist [[James Hansen]] received the [[BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award]] in the Climate Change category in the ninth edition (2016) of the awards.<ref name="Premios Fronteras">{{cite web | title=Syukuro Manabe | website=Premios Fronteras | url=https://www.frontiersofknowledgeawards-fbbva.es/galardonados/syukuro-manabe-2/ | access-date=2021-10-06}}</ref> The two laureates were separately responsible for constructing the first computational models with the power to simulate climate behavior. Decades ago, they correctly predicted how much Earth’s temperature would rise due to increasing atmospheric CO2.
