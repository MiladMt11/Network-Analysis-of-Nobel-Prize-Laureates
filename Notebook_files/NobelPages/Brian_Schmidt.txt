==Early life and education==
[[File:Nobel BrianSchmidt 2011-12-08.ogv|thumb|Interview with Brian Schmidt after his Nobel lecture]]
{{Cosmology|scientists}}
Schmidt, an only child, was born in [[Missoula, Montana]], where his father Dana C. Schmidt was a fisheries biologist. When he was 13, his family relocated to [[Anchorage, Alaska]].<ref name=CT20110406>[http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/lifestyle/style/food-and-wine/restless-experimenter/2126167.aspx Restless experimenter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007012148/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/news/lifestyle/style/food-and-wine/restless-experimenter/2126167.aspx |date=7 October 2011 }} ''The Canberra Times'', 6 April 2011, p 8.</ref><ref name=FACTBOX-Nobel>"FACTBOX-Nobel physics prize winners", Reuters News, 4 October 2011.</ref>

Schmidt attended [[Bartlett High School (Anchorage, Alaska)|Bartlett High School]] in Anchorage, [[Alaska]], and graduated in 1985. He has said that he wanted to be a meteorologist "since I was about five-years-old [but] ... I did some work at the USA [[National Weather Service]] up in Anchorage and didn't enjoy it very much. It was less scientific, not as exciting as I thought it would be—there was a lot of routine. But I guess I was just a little naive about what being a meteorologist meant." His decision to study astronomy, which he had seen as "a minor pastime", was made just before he enrolled at university.<ref name=CT20060701>"Star turn in global success", ''The Canberra Times'', 1 July 2006, p B02.</ref> Even then, he was not fully committed: he said "I'll do astronomy and change into something else later", and just never made that change.<ref name="Mr Universe"/>

While at Harvard, he met his future wife, the Australian (Jenny) Jennifer M. Gordon who was a PhD student in economics. In 1994, they moved to Australia.<ref name=CT20110406/><ref name=wwl/>

==Research and career==
Schmidt was a [[postdoctoral research]] Fellow at the [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] (1993–1994) before moving on to the [[ANU]]'s [[Mount Stromlo Observatory]] in 1995.

In 1994, Schmidt and [[Nicholas B. Suntzeff]] formed the [[High-Z Supernova Search Team]] to measure the expected deceleration of the universe and the [[deceleration parameter]] (q0) using distances to [[Type Ia supernovae]]. In 1995, the HZT at a meeting at the Harvard-Smithsonian [[Center for Astrophysics]] elected Schmidt as the overall leader of the HZT. Schmidt led the team from Australia and in 1998 in the HZT paper with first author [[Adam Riess]] the first evidence was presented that the universe's expansion rate is not decelerating; it is accelerating.<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/3013594.htm Cosmology] ''ABC Catalyst segment on Cosmology, with Brian Schmidt, Ray Norris, & Lawrence Krauss''</ref> The team's observations were contrary to the then-current models, which predicted that the expansion of the universe should be slowing down, and when the preliminary results emerged Schmidt assumed it was an error and he spent the next six weeks trying to find the mistake.<ref name="Our Strange Universe"/> But there was no mistake: contrary to expectations, by monitoring the brightness and measuring the [[redshift]] of the [[supernovae]], they discovered that these billion-year old exploding stars and their galaxies were accelerating away from our reference frame.<ref name="bbc nobel"/> This result was also found nearly simultaneously by the [[Supernova Cosmology Project]], led by [[Saul Perlmutter]].<ref name="bbc nobel">{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-15165371 | title = Nobel physics prize honours accelerating Universe find | first =Jason | last = Palmer | date = 4 October 2011 | access-date = 5 October 2011 | publisher = BBC }}</ref> The corroborating evidence between the two competing studies led to the acceptance of the [[accelerating universe]] theory and initiated new research to understand the nature of the universe, such as the existence of [[dark energy]].<ref name="bbc nobel"/> The discovery of the accelerating universe was named 'Breakthrough of the Year' by ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' in 1998, and Schmidt was jointly awarded the [[2011 Nobel Prize in Physics]] along with Riess and Perlmutter for their groundbreaking work.<ref name="bbc nobel"/>

Schmidt is currently leading the [[SkyMapper]] telescope Project and the associated Southern Sky Survey, which will encompass billions of individual objects, enabling the team to pick out the most unusual objects. In 2014 they announced the discovery of the first star which did not contain any iron, indicating that it is a very primitive star, probably formed during the first rush of star formation following the Big Bang.<ref name="Quantum Correlations">{{cite web|last1=Levine|first1=Alaina G.|title=Quantum Correlations: Interview With Nobel Laureate Brian Schmidt at ESOF on Success, Europe, Women in STEM, War and ET|url=http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2014/09/02/quantum-correlations-interview-with-nobel-laureate-brian-schmidt-at-esof-success-europe-women-in-stem-war-and-et/|publisher=National Geographic Society|access-date=2 April 2015|date=2 September 2014}}</ref>

{{quote|Brian Schmidt is an internationally renowned researcher in cosmology and also in the physics of supernovae and gamma ray bursts. In particular, Schmidt's formation and leadership of the High-z Supernova Search Team led to the discovery that the expansion of our universe is accelerating, for which he shared the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics.  This discovery completely changed our understanding of the universe.  It showed that about 70% of the mass of our Universe is in a previously unknown form which is now usually referred to as 'Dark Energy'.<ref name=frs/>}}
