Wiener]], the [[Rhesus blood group system|Rhesus factor]], thus enabling physicians to [[blood transfusion|transfuse blood]] without endangering the patient's life.<!-- It is worth mentioning about the contribution of [[Jan Janský]] in this field who discovered four types of blood (I, II, II IV). --> With [[Constantin Levaditi]] and [[Erwin Popper]], he discovered the [[polio virus]] in 1909.  He received the [[Aronson Prize]] in 1926. In 1930, he received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]]. He was posthumously awarded the [[Lasker Award]] in 1946, and has been described as the father of transfusion medicine.<ref>{{cite book|first1=Paul|last1=Speiser|first2=Ferdinand G.|last2=Smekal|title=Karl Landsteiner: Entdecker der Blutgruppen und Pionier der Immunologie|edition=3rd|location=Berlin|year=1990|isbn=9783894120849}}{{page needed|date=March 2020}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Born into a [[Jewish]] family, Landsteiner's father, Leopold (1818–1875), a renowned Viennese journalist who was editor-in-chief of ''[[Die Presse]]'', died at age 56, when Karl was only 6. This led to a close relationship between him and his mother Fanny (née Hess; 1837–1908). After graduating with the Matura exam from a Vienna secondary school, he took up the study of medicine at the [[University of Vienna]] and wrote his doctoral thesis in 1891. While still a student he published an essay on the influence of diets on the composition of blood.<ref name="Nobel" />

From 1891 to 1893, Landsteiner studied chemistry in [[Würzburg]] under [[Hermann Emil Fischer]], in [[München]], [[Eugen Bamberger]] and in [[Zürich]] under [[Arthur Rudolf Hantzsch]]. He had a number of publications from that period, some of them in co-operation with his professors.{{sfn|Speiser|Smekal|1990|p=24}}

==Research work in Vienna; discovery of the polio virus==
After returning to Vienna he became an assistant to [[Max von Gruber]] at the Hygienic Institute. In his studies he concentrated on the mechanism of immunity and the nature of antibodies. From November 1897 to 1908 Landsteiner was an assistant at the pathological-anatomical institute of the University of Vienna under [[Anton Weichselbaum]], where he published 75 papers, dealing with issues in serology, bacteriology, virology and pathological anatomy. In addition he did some 3,600 autopsies in those ten years. Weichselbaum was Landsteiner's tutor for his postdoctoral lecture qualification in 1903.{{sfn|Speiser|Smekal|1990|p=33}} From 1908 to 1920 Landsteiner was prosector at the  Wilhelminenspital in Vienna and in 1911 he was sworn in as an associate professor of pathological anatomy. During that time he discovered – in co-operation with [[Erwin Popper]] – the infectious character of [[poliomyelitis]] and isolated the polio virus.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Landsteiner|first1=K.|last2=Popper|first2=E.|author-link2=Erwin Popper|title=Übertragung der Poliomyelitis acuta auf Affen |trans-title=Transmission of ''Poliomyelitis acuta'' to monkeys |journal=Zeitschrift für Immunitätsforschung und experimentelle Therapie [Journal for Research on Immunity and Experimental Therapy] |volume=2|year=1909|pages=377–390|language=de |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3208372&view=1up&seq=389&skin=2021 }}</ref> In recognition of this groundbreaking discovery, which proved to be the basis for the fight against polio, he was posthumously inducted into the [[Polio Hall of Fame]] at [[Warm Springs, Georgia]], which was dedicated in January 1958.

==Research of the blood groups==

In 1900 Karl Landsteiner found out that the blood of two people under contact [[Hemagglutination|agglutinates]], and in 1901 he found that this effect was due to contact of blood with [[blood serum]]. As a result, he succeeded in identifying [[ABO blood group system|the three blood groups A, B and O, which he labelled C, of human blood]]. Landsteiner also found out that [[blood transfusion]] between persons with the same blood group did not lead to the destruction of blood cells, whereas this occurred between persons of different blood groups.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Karl |last=Landsteiner |title=Zur Kenntnis der antifermentativen, lytischen und agglutinierenden Wirkungen des Blutserums und der Lymphe |journal=Centralblatt F. Bakteriologie, Parasitenkunde U. Infektionskrankheiten |volume=27 |year=1900 |pages=357–362 }}</ref> Based on his findings,  the first successful blood transfusion was performed by [[Reuben Ottenberg]]  at [[Mount Sinai Hospital (Manhattan)|Mount Sinai Hospital]] in New York in 1907.

Today it is well known that persons with blood group AB can accept donations of the other blood groups, and that persons with blood group O-negative can donate to all other groups. Individuals with blood group AB are referred to as ''universal recipients'' and those with blood group O-negative are known as ''universal donors''. These donor-recipient relationships arise due to the fact that type O-negative blood possesses neither antigens of blood group A nor of blood group B. Therefore, the immune systems of persons with blood group A, B or AB do not refuse the donation. Further, because persons with blood group AB do not form antibodies against either the antigens of blood group A or B, they can accept blood from persons with these blood groups, as well as from persons with blood group O-negative.

In today's blood transfusions only concentrates of [[red blood cell]]s without serum are transmitted, which is of great importance in surgical practice. In 1930 Landsteiner was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in recognition of these achievements. For his pioneering work, he is recognized as the father of transfusion medicine.<ref>{{cite news | title = Homage to scientist on Blood Donor's Day | date = 15 June 2006 | url = http://www.tribuneindia.com/2006/20060615/ldh3.htm | work = [[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]] | access-date = 14 January 2012}}</ref>

==Research work in the Netherlands and the United States==
[[File:LandsteinerWS.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Landsteiner bronze bust at Warm Springs]]
After [[World War I]], Vienna and the [[First Austrian Republic|new republic of Austria]] as a whole was in a desolate economic state, a situation in which Landsteiner did not see any possibilities to carry on with his research work. He decided to move to the Netherlands and accepted a post as prosector in the small Catholic ''St. Joannes de Deo'' hospital (now MCH Westeinde) in [[The Hague]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://landsteiner.nl/het-instituut/wie-was-karl-landsteiner|title=Wie was Karl Landsteiner?|website=Landsteiner Instituut|language=nl|trans-title=Who was Karl Landsteiner?|access-date=13 December 2018}}</ref> and, in order to improve his financial situation also took a job in a small factory, producing old [[tuberculin]] (''tuberculinum prestinum'').{{sfn|Speiser|Smekal|1990|p=63}} He also published a number of papers, five of them being published in Dutch by the Royal Academy of Sciences. Yet working conditions proved to be not much better than in post-war Vienna. So Landsteiner accepted the invitation that reached him from New York, initiated by [[Simon Flexner]], who was familiar with Landsteiner's work, to work for the Rockefeller Institute. He arrived there with his family in the spring of 1923.<ref name="Nobel" /> Throughout the 1920s Landsteiner worked on the problems of immunity and allergy. In 1927 he discovered new blood groups: M, N and P, refining the work he had begun 20 years before. Shortly thereafter, Landsteiner and his collaborator, [[Philip Levine (physician)|Philip Levine]], published the work and, later that same year, the types began to be used in [[parental test|paternity suits]].

==Awards and honours==
Landsteiner was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1932 and awarded the [[Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh]] in 1937. He was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1941|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS)]] in 1941.<ref name="frs"/> In 1946, he was posthumously awarded the [[Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award]].

==Personal life==
Landsteiner converted from [[Judaism]] to [[Christianity]] in 1890, as he baptised into the [[Catholic Church]].<ref>Staudacher, Anna L. (2009) ''"... meldet den Austritt aus dem mosaischen Glauben". 18000 Austritte aus dem Judentum in Wien, 1868–1914: Namen – Quellen – Daten''. Peter Lang, Frankfurt, {{ISBN|978-3-631-55832-4}}, p. 349</ref> In 1916, he married Leopoldine Helene Wlasto, a [[Greek Orthodox]] woman who converted to her husband's Catholic faith. In 1937, Landsteiner unsuccessfully<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americanjewisharchives.org/publications/concise.php|title=Concise Dictionary of American Jewish Biography|publisher=[[The Jacob Rader Marcus Center of the American Jewish Archives]]}}{{page needed|date=March 2020}}</ref> initiated legal action against an American publisher who had included him in the book ''Who's Who in American Jewry'', stating that "it will be detrimental to me to emphasize publicly the religion of my ancestors."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1937/04/06/archive/dr-landsteiner-sues-to-escape-being-labelled-jew|title=Dr. Landsteiner Sues to Escape Being Labelled Jew|date=6 April 1937|website=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]}}</ref>
