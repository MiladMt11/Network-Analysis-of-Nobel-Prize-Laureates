==Education, early life and career==
Lwoff was born in [[Ainay-le-Château]], [[Allier]], in [[Auvergne (région)|Auvergne]], France, the son of Marie (Siminovitch), an artist, and Solomon Lwoff, a psychiatrist.<ref name="nytobit" /> He joined the [[Institute Pasteur]] in Paris when he was 19 years old. In 1932, he finished his PhD and, with the help of a grant from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], moved with his wife and co-researcher [[Marguerite Lwoff]] to the [[Max Planck Institute for Medical Research|Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Medical Research]] of [[Heidelberg]] to [[Otto Meyerhof]], where he did research on the development of [[flagellate]]s. Another Rockefeller grant allowed him go to the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1937. In 1938, he was appointed departmental head at the [[Institut Pasteur]], where he did groundbreaking research on [[bacteriophage]]s, [[microbiota]] and on the [[poliovirus]]. 

==Awards and honors==
He was awarded numerous prizes from the French [[Académie des Sciences]], the [[Grand Prix Charles-Leopold Mayer]], the [[Leeuwenhoek Medal]] of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1960 and the [[David Keilin|Keilin]] Medal of the British [[Biochemical Society]] in 1964. He was awarded a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Medicine]] in 1965 for the discovery of the mechanism that some viruses (which he named [[provirus]]es) use to infect [[bacterium|bacteria]].<ref name=nytobit>{{Cite news | issn = 0362-4331 | last = Sullivan | first = Walter | title = Andre Lwoff, 92, Biologist, Dies; Shared Nobel for Study of Cells | work = [[The New York Times]] | access-date = 2013-05-24 | date = 1994-10-04 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/04/obituaries/andre-lwoff-92-biologist-dies-shared-nobel-for-study-of-cells.html }}</ref> Throughout his career he partnered with his wife [[Marguerite Lwoff]] although he gained considerably more recognition.
