'''William Bradford Shockley Jr.''' (February 13, 1910 – August 12, 1989) was an American physicist and inventor. He was the manager of a research group at [[Bell Labs]] that included [[John Bardeen]] and [[Walter Houser Brattain|Walter Brattain]]. The three scientists were jointly awarded the 1956 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for "their researches on [[semiconductor]]s and their discovery of the [[transistor]] effect". 

Partly as a result of Shockley's attempts to commercialize a new transistor design in the 1950s and 1960s, California's "[[Silicon Valley]]" became a hotbed of electronics innovation. In his later life, while a professor of [[electrical engineering]] at [[Stanford University]], Shockley became a proponent of [[eugenics]].<ref name="NYTimesobit"/><ref name="PhysicsTodayobit" /> A 2019 study in the journal ''[[Intelligence (journal)|Intelligence]]'' found him to be the second-most controversial (behind [[Arthur Jensen]]) intelligence researcher among 55 persons covered.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Carl|first1=N.|last2=Woodley of Menie|first2=M.

==Early life and education==
Shockley was  born to American parents in [[London]] on February 13, 1910, and was raised in his family's hometown of [[Palo Alto]], California from the age of three.<ref name="IREProceedings1952" /> His father, William Hillman Shockley, was a [[mining engineer]] who speculated in mines for a living and spoke eight languages. His mother, May (née Bradford), grew up in the American West, graduated from Stanford University and became the first female U.S. Deputy mining surveyor.<ref name="Shurkin2006p3" /> Shockley was homeschooled up to the age of eight, due to his parents' dislike of public schools as well as Shockley's habit of violent tantrums.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Palo Alto History|url=http://www.paloaltohistory.org/william-shockley.php|access-date=December 14, 2020|website=www.paloaltohistory.org|quote=In Palo Alto, William's temper improved little at first.  But ignoring psychiatric recommendations for more socialization, his parents decided to home school William until age eight.  Finally, feeling they were unable to keep him out of a school setting any longer, they sent him to the Homer Avenue School for two years, where his behavior improved dramatically --- he even earned an "A" in comportment in his first year.}}</ref> He spent two years at Palo Alto Military Academy, then briefly enrolled in the Los Angeles Coaching School to study physics and later graduated from [[Hollywood High School]] in 1927.<ref>{{cite web|url =https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-dec-02-tm-10501-story.html|title =The Twisted Legacy of William Shockley|first =Michael A.|last =Hiltzik|website =Los Angeles Times|date =December 2, 2001}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Moll|first=John L.|url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/shockley-w.pdf|title=A Biographical Memoir of William Bradford Shockley|publisher=National Academies Press|year=1995|location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref>

Shockley earned his Bachelor of Science degree from [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] in 1932 and a PhD from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in 1936. The title of his doctoral thesis was ''Electronic Bands in Sodium Chloride'', a topic suggested by his thesis advisor, [[John C. Slater]].<ref name="Shurkin2006pp38–39" /> After receiving his doctorate, Shockley joined a research group headed by [[Clinton Davisson]] at [[Bell Labs]] in New Jersey. The next few years were productive for Shockley. He published a number of fundamental papers on solid state physics in ''[[Physical Review]]''. In 1938, he received his first patent, "Electron Discharge Device", on [[electron multiplier]]s.<ref name="Shurkin2006p48" />

==Career==
Shockley was one of the first recruits to [[Bell Labs]] by [[Mervin Kelly]], who became director of research at the company in 1936 and focused on hiring [[solid-state physicist]]s. Executives at Bell Labs had theorized that [[semiconductors]] may offer solid-state alternatives to the [[vacuum tube]]s used throughout Bell's nationwide telephone system. Shockley conceived a number of designs based on copper-oxide semiconductor materials, and with [[Walter Brattain]] unsuccessfully attempted to create a prototype in 1939.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/technology/transistor/Innovation-at-Bell-Labs Transistor – Innovation at Bell Labs] Encyclopedia Britannica</ref> 

When [[World War II]] broke out, Shockley prior research was interrupted and he became involved in [[radar]] research in [[Manhattan]] ([[New York City]]). In May 1942, he took leave from Bell Labs to become a research director at [[Columbia University]]'s Anti-Submarine Warfare Operations Group.<ref>''Broken Genius'' p. 65–67</ref> This involved devising methods for countering the tactics of submarines with improved [[convoy]]ing techniques, optimizing [[depth charge]] patterns, and so on. This project required frequent trips to the Pentagon and Washington, where Shockley met many high-ranking officers and government officials. 

In 1944, he organized a training program for [[B-29]] bomber pilots to use new [[radar]] bomb sights. In late 1944 he took a three-month tour to bases around the world to assess the results. For this project, Secretary of War [[Robert Porter Patterson|Robert Patterson]] awarded Shockley the [[Medal for Merit]] on October 17, 1946.<ref name="Shurkin2006p85"/>

In July 1945, the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] asked Shockley to prepare a report on the question of probable casualties from an invasion of the Japanese mainland. Shockley concluded:

{{quote|If the study shows that the behavior of nations in all historical cases comparable to Japan's has in fact been invariably consistent with the behavior of the troops in battle, then it means that the Japanese dead and ineffectives at the time of the defeat will exceed the corresponding number for the Germans. In other words, we shall probably have to kill at least 5 to 10 million Japanese. This might cost us between 1.7 and 4 million casualties including 400,000 to 800,000 killed.<ref name="Giangreco1997" />}}

This report influenced the decision of the United States to drop [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombs]] on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which precipitated the unconditional surrender of Japan.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Robert P. |last=Newman |title=Hiroshima and the Trashing of Henry Stimson |journal=[[The New England Quarterly]] |volume=71 |issue=1 |date=1998 |page=27 |doi=10.2307/366722|jstor=366722 }}</ref>

Shockley was the first physicist to propose a [[Log-normal distribution|log-normal]] distribution to model the creation process for scientific research papers.<ref>The Artful Universe by John D. Barrow, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1995, p. 239</ref>

===Development of the transistor===
Shortly after the war ended in 1945, Bell Labs formed a solid-state physics group, led by Shockley and chemist Stanley Morgan, which included [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter Brattain]], physicist [[Gerald Pearson]], chemist Robert Gibney, electronics expert Hilbert Moore, and several technicians. Their assignment was to seek a solid-state alternative to fragile glass [[vacuum tube]] amplifiers. Its first attempts were based on Shockley's ideas about using an external electrical field on a semiconductor to affect its conductivity. These experiments failed every time in all sorts of configurations and materials. The group was at a standstill until Bardeen suggested a theory that invoked [[surface states]] that prevented the field from penetrating the semiconductor. The group changed its focus to study these surface states and they met almost daily to discuss the work. The rapport of the group was excellent, and ideas were freely exchanged.<ref>Brattain quoted in ''Crystal Fire'' p. 127</ref>

By the winter of 1946 they had enough results that Bardeen submitted a paper on the surface states to ''[[Physical Review]]''. Brattain started experiments to study the surface states through observations made while shining a bright light on the semiconductor's surface. This led to several more papers (one of them co-authored with Shockley), which estimated the density of the surface states to be more than enough to account for their failed experiments. The pace of the work picked up significantly when they started to surround point contacts between the semiconductor and the conducting wires with [[electrolyte]]s. Moore built a circuit that allowed them to vary the frequency of the input signal easily. Finally they began to get some evidence of power amplification when Pearson, acting on a suggestion by Shockley, put a voltage on a droplet of glycol borate placed across a [[P–n junction]].<ref name="Crystal Fire p. 132">''Crystal Fire'' p.132</ref>
[[File:Bardeen Shockley Brattain 1948.JPG|thumb|John Bardeen, William Shockley and Walter Brattain at [[Bell Labs]], 1948]]

Bell Labs' attorneys soon discovered Shockley's field effect principle had been anticipated and devices based on it patented in 1930 by [[Julius Lilienfeld]], who filed his [[MESFET]]-like patent in Canada on October 22, 1925.<ref>{{patent|CA|272437 |"Electric current control mechanism", first filed in Canada on October 22, 1925}}</ref><ref>[http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/~eugeniik/history/lilienfeld.htm Lilienfeld] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061002065548/http://chem.ch.huji.ac.il/~eugeniik/history/lilienfeld.htm |date=October 2, 2006 }}</ref> Although the patent appeared "breakable" (it could not work) the patent attorneys based one of its four patent applications only on the Bardeen-Brattain point contact design. Three others (submitted first) covered the electrolyte-based transistors with Bardeen, Gibney and Brattain as the inventors.{{cn|date=June 2020}} 

Shockley's name was not on any of these patent applications. This angered Shockley, who thought his name should also be on the patents because the work was based on his field effect idea. He even made efforts to have the patent written only in his name, and told Bardeen and Brattain of his intentions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/William_Shockley |title=William Shockley |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |access-date=July 18, 2011}}</ref>

Shockley, angered by not being included on the patent applications, secretly continued his own work to build a different sort of transistor based on junctions instead of point contacts; he expected this kind of design would be more likely to be commercially viable. The point contact transistor, he believed, would prove to be fragile and difficult to manufacture. Shockley was also dissatisfied with certain parts of the explanation for how the point contact transistor worked and conceived of the possibility of [[minority carrier]] injection. 

On February 13, 1948 another team member, [[John N. Shive]], built a point contact transistor with bronze contacts on the front and back of thin wedge of germanium, proving that [[Electron hole|holes]] could diffuse through bulk germanium and not just along the surface as previously thought.<ref name="crystal-fire">{{cite book

This structure went on to be used for the vast majority of all transistors into the 1960s, and evolved into the bipolar junction transistor. Shockley later admitted that the workings of the team were "mixture of cooperation and competition". He also admitted that he kept some of his own work secret until his "hand was forced" by Shive's 1948 advance.<ref>{{cite news

}}</ref> Shockley worked out a rather complete description of what he called the "sandwich" transistor, and a first proof of principle was obtained on April 7, 1949.

Meanwhile, Shockley worked on his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''[[Electrons and Holes in Semiconductors]]'' which was published as a 558-page treatise in 1950. The tome included Shockley's critical ideas of drift and diffusion and the differential equations that govern the flow of electrons in solid state crystals. [[Diode#Shockley diode equation|Shockley's diode equation]] is also described. This seminal work became the reference text for other scientists working to develop and improve new variants of the transistor and other devices based on semiconductors.<ref>''Broken Genius'', p 121-122</ref>

This resulted in his invention of the bipolar "[[Bipolar junction transistor|junction transistor]]", which was announced at a press conference on July 4, 1951.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.computerhistory.org/semiconductor/timeline/1951-First.html|title = 1951 – First grown-junction transistors fabricated|publisher = [[Computer History Museum]]|year = 2007|access-date = July 3, 2013}}</ref>

In 1951, he was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] (NAS). He was forty-one years old; this was rather young for such an election. Two years later, he was chosen as the recipient of the prestigious [[Comstock Prize in Physics|Comstock Prize]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sns.ias.edu/~jnb/Vitae/NASaward/nasaward.html|title=Comstock Prize}}</ref> for Physics by the NAS, and was the recipient of many other awards and honors.

The ensuing publicity generated by the "invention of the transistor" often thrust Shockley to the fore, much to the chagrin of Bardeen and Brattain. Bell Labs management, however, consistently presented all three inventors as a team. Though Shockley would correct the record where reporters gave him sole credit for the invention,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/transistor/album1/shockley/shockley3.html|title=Bill Shockley, Part 3 of 3|first=ScienCentral|last=ScienCentral|website=www.pbs.org}}</ref> he eventually infuriated and alienated Bardeen and Brattain, and he essentially blocked the two from working on the junction transistor. Bardeen began pursuing a theory for superconductivity and left Bell Labs in 1951. Brattain refused to work with Shockley further and was assigned to another group. Neither Bardeen nor Brattain had much to do with the development of the transistor beyond the first year after its invention.<ref>''Crystal Fire'' p. 278</ref>

===Shockley Semiconductor===
{{Main|Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory}}
In 1956 Shockley moved from New Jersey to [[Mountain View, California]] to start [[Shockley Semiconductor Laboratory]] to live closer to his ailing and elderly mother in Palo Alto, California.<ref>{{cite news |title=Holding On |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/realestate/keymagazine/406Lede-t.html?pagewanted=all |quote=In 1955, the physicist William Shockley set up a semiconductor laboratory in Mountain View, partly to be near his mother in Palo Alto. ...|newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=April 6, 2008 |access-date=December 7, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Two Views of Innovation, Colliding in Washington |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07EEDC153BF930A25752C0A96E9C8B63& |quote=The co-inventor of the transistor and the founder of the valley's first chip company, William Shockley, moved to Palo Alto, Calif., because his mother lived there. ...|newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=January 13, 2008 |access-date=December 7, 2014 }}</ref> The company, a division of [[Beckman Instruments]], Inc., was the first establishment working on silicon semiconductor devices in what came to be known as [[Silicon Valley]].

After he received the Nobel Prize in 1956 his demeanor changed, as evidenced in his increasingly autocratic, erratic and hard-to-please management style.<ref>PBS program – American Experience (2012) 'Silicon Valley'</ref> Shockley became increasingly domineering and paranoid. In one well-known incident, he demanded [[lie detector]] tests to find the "culprit" after a company secretary suffered a minor cut.<ref>''Crystal Fire'' p. 247</ref> In late 1957, eight of Shockley's researchers, who would come to be known as the "[[traitorous eight]]", resigned after Shockley decided not to continue research into silicon-based semiconductors.<ref name="Goodheart2006" /> They went on to form [[Fairchild Semiconductor]], a loss from which Shockley Semiconductor never recovered and which led to its purchase by another company three years later. Over the course of the next 20 years, more than 65 new enterprises would end up having employee connections back to Fairchild.<ref name="NetValley">{{cite web|url=http://www.netvalley.com/silicon_valley/Legal_Bridge_From_El_Dorado_to_Silicon_Valley.html |title=A legal bridge spanning 100 years: from the gold mines of El Dorado to the "golden" startups of Silicon Valley |author=Gregory Gromov}}</ref>

A group of about thirty colleagues who had met on and off since 1956 met again at Stanford in 2002 to reminisce about their time with Shockley and his central role in sparking the information technology revolution. The group's organizer said, "Shockley is the man who brought silicon to Silicon Valley."<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/news/pr/02/shockley1023.html|title=William Shockley: still controversial, after all these years|publisher=Stanford University|date=October 22, 2002|author=Dawn Levy|access-date=June 14, 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404102748/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/news/pr/02/shockley1023.html|archive-date=April 4, 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Views on race and eugenics==
{{See also|Flynn effect|History of the race and intelligence controversy}}
After Shockley left his role as director of Shockley Semiconductor, he joined Stanford University, where in 1963 he was appointed the [[Alexander M. Poniatoff]] Professor of Engineering and Applied Science, in which position he remained until his retirement as professor emeritus in 1975.<ref>''Crystal Fire'' p. 277</ref> In this position, Shockley became interested in questions of [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[human intelligence]], and [[eugenics]]. He thought this work was important to the genetic future of the [[human species]] and he came to describe it as the most important work of his career; however, expressing these views led to the damaging of his reputation. Shockley argued that a higher rate of reproduction among the less intelligent was having a [[dysgenics|dysgenic]] effect, and that a drop in average intelligence would ultimately lead to a decline in [[civilization]]. He also claimed that blacks were genetically inferior to whites on an intellectual level.<ref name=latimesobit/> For example, in a debate with psychiatrist [[Frances Cress Welsing]] M.D. and on ''[[Firing Line (TV series)|Firing Line]]'' with [[William F. Buckley Jr.]]:

<blockquote>My research leads me inescapably to the opinion that the major cause of the American Negro's intellectual and social deficits is hereditary and racially genetic in origin and, thus, not remediable to a major degree by practical improvements in the environment.<ref>{{cite web|title=Firing Line with William F.

Shockley's writings and lectures on this topic were partly based on the writings of psychologist [[Cyril Burt]] and were funded by the [[Pioneer Fund]]. Shockley also proposed that individuals with [[IQ]]s below 100 be paid to undergo voluntary [[sterilization (medicine)|sterilization]].<ref name=latimesobit>{{cite news|last1=BOYER|first1=EDWARD J.|title=Controversial Nobel Laureate Shockley Dies|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-08-14/news/mn-369_1_nobel-laureate-shockley|access-date=May 11, 2015|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=August 14, 1989}}</ref> Anthropologist [[Roger Pearson (anthropologist)|Roger Pearson]] defended Shockley in a self-published book co-authored with Shockley.<ref>Pearson, Roger (1992).

In 1981, Shockley filed a [[libel]] suit in Atlanta against the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]'' after a science writer, Roger Witherspoon, compared Shockley's advocacy of a voluntary sterilization program to [[Nazi human experimentation]]. The suit took three years to go to trial. Shockley won the suit but received only one dollar in damages<ref>{{cite news |first=Ronald |last=Kessler |title=Absent at the Creation; How one scientist made off with the biggest invention since the light bulb |url=http://www1.hollins.edu/faculty/richter/327/AbsentCreation.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224230527/http://www1.hollins.edu/faculty/richter/327/AbsentCreation.htm |archive-date=February 24, 2015 }}</ref> and no punitive damages. Shockley's biographer Joel Shurkin, a science writer on the staff of Stanford University during those years, sums this up as saying that the statement was defamatory, but Shockley's reputation was not worth much by the time the trial reached a verdict.<ref name="Shurkin2006pp259–260" /> Shockley taped his [[telephone]] conversations with reporters, and then sent the transcript to them by registered mail. At one point he toyed with the idea of making them take a simple quiz on his work before discussing the subject with them. His habit of saving all his papers (including laundry lists) provides abundant documentation for researchers on his life.<ref name="Shurkin2006p286" />

Shockley was a candidate for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination in the [[1982 United States Senate election in California]]. He ran on a [[Single-issue politics|single-issue platform]] of highlighting the "dysgenic threat" of some racial groups, including African-Americans, to American society.<ref>http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/shockley-w.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/william-shockley|title = William Shockley}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/12/us/shockley-nobel-winner-files-for-senate-race-in-california.html|title = Shockley, Nobel Winner, Files for Senate Race in California|newspaper = The New York Times|date = February 12, 1982}}</ref> He came in eighth place in the primary, receiving 8,308 votes and 0.37% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web |title= CA US Senate – D Primary|url=https://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=382924|website=OurCampaigns |access-date=November 12, 2019}}</ref>

==Personal life==
At age 23 and while still a student, Shockley married Jean Bailey in August 1933. The couple had two sons and a daughter.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aso/databank/entries/btshoc.html A Science Odyssey: People and Discoveries: William Shockley] PBS</ref> Although one of his sons earned a PhD at Stanford University and his daughter graduated from Radcliffe College, Shockley believed his children "represent a very significant regression ... my first wife – their mother – had not as high an academic-achievement standing as I had."<ref name=latimesobit/>

Shockley became an accomplished rock climber, going often to the [[Shawangunks]] in the [[Hudson River Valley]]. He pioneered a route across an overhang, known as "Shockley's Ceiling", which remains one of the classic climbing routes in the area.<ref name="Crystal Fire p. 132"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105799687/shockleys-ceiling |title=Shockley's Ceiling  |website=[[Mountain Project]] |access-date=December 12, 2018}}
</ref> Several climbing guidebooks changed the route's name to "The Ceiling" in 2020 due to controversy associated with Shockley's eugenics research.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Rock Climb The Ceiling, The Gunks|url=https://www.mountainproject.com/route/105799687/the-ceiling|access-date=September 16, 2020|website=Mountain Project}}</ref>  Shockley was popular as a speaker, lecturer, and an amateur magician. He once "magically" produced a bouquet of roses at the end of his address before the [[American Physical Society]]. He was also known in his early years for his elaborate practical jokes.<ref>''Crystal Fire'' p. 45</ref>

Shockley [[donated sperm]] to the [[Repository for Germinal Choice]], a [[sperm bank]] founded by [[Robert Klark Graham]] in hopes of spreading humanity's best [[gene]]s. The bank, called by the media the "Nobel Prize sperm bank", claimed to have three Nobel Prize-winning donors, though Shockley was the only one to publicly acknowledge his involvement. However, Shockley's controversial views brought the Repository for Germinal Choice a degree of notoriety and may have discouraged other Nobel Prize winners from donating sperm.<ref>{{cite news |author=Polly Morrice |title=The Genius Factory: Test-Tube Superbabies |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/03/books/review/03MORRICE.html?ei=5088&en=859598b50aab62e1&ex=1278043200&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&pagewanted=all# |work=The New York Times |date=July 3, 2005 |access-date=February 12, 2008}}</ref>
