Selma Ottilia Lovisa Lagerlöf was born on 20 November 1858 at [[Mårbacka]],<ref>{{citation|author=H. G. L.|title=The American-Scandinavian review|volume=4|page=36|year=1916|editor=Henry Goddard Leach|chapter=Miss Lagerlöf at Marbacka|publisher=American-Scandinavian Foundation|editor-link=Henry Goddard Leach}}</ref> [[Värmland]], [[Union between Sweden and Norway|Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway]]. Lagerlöf was the daughter of Erik Gustaf Lagerlöf, a lieutenant in the Royal Värmland Regiment, and Louise Lagerlöf (''née'' Wallroth), whose father was a well-to-do merchant and a [[foundry]] owner ({{Lang|sv|brukspatron}}).<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=The Saga of Gosta Berling|last=Lagerlof|first=Selma|last2=Schoolfield|first2=George|publisher=Penguin Classics|year=2009|isbn=9781101140482|location=New York}}</ref> Lagerlöf was the couple's fifth child out of six. She was born with a [[Hip dysplasia (human)|hip injury]], which was caused by detachment in the hip joint. At the age of three and a half, a sickness left her lame in both legs, although she later recovered.{{cn|date=December 2020}} 

She was a quiet, serious child with a deep love for [[Reading (process)|reading]]. She wrote poetry but did not publish anything until later in life. Her grandmother helped raise her, often telling stories of fairytales and fantasy. Growing up, she was plain and slightly lame, and an account stated that the cross-country wanderings of Margarethe and Elisabet in ''Gösta Berling's Saga'' could be the author's compensatory fantasies.<ref name=":1" /> She received her schooling at home since the [[Volksschule]] compulsory education system was not [[Education in Sweden#History of education in Sweden|fully developed yet]]. She studied [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]]. After reading ''Osceola'' by [[Thomas Mayne Reid]] at the age of seven, she decided she would be a writer when she grew up.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.marbacka.com/selma_lagerlof.php|title=Selma Lagerlöf – författaren|website=www.marbacka.com|access-date=2019-10-18|archive-date=11 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911164922/http://www.marbacka.com/selma_lagerlof.php|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1868, at the age of 10, Selma began reading the [[Bible]]. At this time her father was very ill, and she hoped that God would heal him if she read the Bible from cover to cover. Her father lived for another 17 years. In this manner, Lagerlöf became accustomed to the language of Scripture.{{cn|date=December 2020}}

The sale of {{Lang|sv|Mårbacka|italic=no}} in 1884 had a serious impact on her development. Selma's father is said to have been an alcoholic, something she rarely discussed.<ref name="Selma Lagerlöf: Surface and Depth">{{Cite web|url=http://publicdomainreview.org/2012/01/11/selma-lagerlof-surface-and-depth/|title=Selma Lagerlöf: Surface and Depth|website=The Public Domain Review|access-date=8 March 2016}}</ref> Her father did not want Selma to continue her education or remain involved with the women's movement.{{Clarify|reason=How did this involvement start?|date=September 2018}} Later in life, she would buy back her father's estate with the money she received for her Nobel Prize.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Selma-Lagerlof|title=Selma Lagerlof {{!}} Swedish author|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=8 March 2016}}</ref> Lagerlöf lived there for the rest of her life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1909/lagerlof/facts/|title=Selma Lagerlöf - Facts - NobelPrize.org|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-24}}</ref> She also completed her studies at the [[Royal Seminary]] to become a teacher the same year as her father died.{{cn|date=December 2020}}

=== Teaching career ===
Lagerlöf studied at the [[Högre lärarinneseminariet]] in Stockholm from 1882 to 1885. She worked as a country schoolteacher at a high school for girls in [[Landskrona]] from 1885 to 1895,<ref name=ea>{{Cite Americana|wstitle=Lagerlof, Ottilia Lovisa Selma}}</ref> while honing her story-telling skills, with particular focus on the legends she had learned as a child. She liked the teaching profession and appreciated her students. She had a talent for capturing the children's attention through telling them stories about the different countries about which they were studying or stories about [[Jesus]] and his disciples. During this period of her life, Selma lived with her aunt Lovisa Lagerlöf.{{cn|date=December 2020}}

Through her studies at the Royal Women's Superior Training Academy in [[Stockholm]], Lagerlöf reacted against the realism of contemporary Swedish-language writers such as [[August Strindberg]]. She began her first novel, ''[[Gösta Berling's Saga]],'' while working as a teacher in Landskrona. Her first break as a writer came when she submitted the first chapters to a literary contest in the magazine'' [[Idun (magazine)|Idun]]'', and won a publishing contract for the whole book. At first, her writing only received mild reviews from critics.  Once a popular male critic, [[Georg Brandes]], gave her positive reviews of the Danish translation, her popularity soared.<ref name="Selma Lagerlof">{{Cite web|url=http://authorscalendar.info/lagerlof.htm|title=Selma Ottiliana Lovisa Lagerlöf (1858–1940)|website=authorscalendar.info|access-date=8 March 2016}}</ref> She received financial support of [[Fredrika Limnell]], who wished to enable her to concentrate on her writing.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Selma Lagerlof Megapack: 31 Classic Novels and Stories|last=Lagerlof|first=Selma|publisher=Wildside Press LLC|year=2013|isbn=9781434443441|location=Rockville|pages=20}}</ref>
==Literary career==
A visit in 1900 to the [[American Colony (Jerusalem)|American Colony]] in [[Jerusalem]] became the inspiration for Lagerlöf's book by that name.<ref name="change">{{citation |url=http://info.jpost.com/C002/Supplements/TimesOfChange/book_ch1_3.html |title=Times of Change |first=Heike |last=Zaun-Goshen |year=2002 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100617050146/http://info.jpost.com/C002/Supplements/TimesOfChange/book_ch1_3.html |archive-date=17 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The royal family and the Swedish Academy gave her substantial financial support to continue her passion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1909/lagerlof-bio.html|title=Selma Lagerlöf – Biographical|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=8 March 2016}}</ref> ''Jerusalem'' was also acclaimed by critics, who began comparing her to [[Homer]] and [[Shakespeare]], so that she became a popular figure both in Sweden and abroad.<ref name=":0" /> By 1895, she gave up her teaching to devote herself to her writing. With the help of proceeds from ''Gösta Berling's Saga'' and a scholarship and grant, she made two journeys, which were largely instrumental in providing material for her next novel. With Elkan, she traveled to Italy, and she also traveled to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] and other parts of the East.<ref>{{Cite EB1922|wstitle=Lagerlöf, Selma}}</ref> In Italy, a legend of a Christ Child figure that had been replaced with a false version inspired Lagerlöf's novel {{Lang|sv|Antikrists mirakler}} (''The Miracles of the Antichrist''). Set in [[Sicily]], the novel explores the interplay between Christian and socialist moral systems.  However, most of Lagerlöf's stories were set in Värmland.{{cn|date=December 2020}}

In 1902, Lagerlöf was asked by the National Teachers' Association to write a geography book for children. She wrote {{Lang|sv|Nils Holgerssons underbara resa genom Sverige}} (''[[The Wonderful Adventures of Nils]]''), a novel about a boy from the southernmost part of Sweden, who had been shrunk to the size of a thumb and who travelled on the back of a goose across the country. Lagerlöf mixed historical and geographical facts about the provinces of Sweden with the tale of the boy's adventures until he managed to return home and was restored to his normal size.<ref name="Selma Lagerlöf: Surface and Depth" /> The novel is one of Lagerlöf's most well-known books, and it has been translated into more than 30 languages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ub.lu.se/en/sites/ub.lu.se.en/files/2006_nils_holgersson_100_ar.pdf |title=100 år med Nils Holgersson |publisher=Lund University Library |access-date=31 May 2017}}</ref>

She moved in 1897 to [[Falun]], and met [[Valborg Olander]], who became her literary assistant and friend, but Elkan's jealousy of Olander was a complication in the relationship. Olander, a teacher, was also active in the growing [[women's suffrage movement]] in Sweden. Selma Lagerlöf herself was active as a speaker for the [[National Association for Women's Suffrage (Sweden)|National Association for Women's Suffrage]], which was beneficial for the organisation because of the great respect which surrounded Lagerlöf, and she spoke at the International Suffrage Congress in Stockholm in June 1911, where she gave the opening address, as well as at the victory party of the Swedish suffrage movement after women suffrage had been granted in May 1919.<ref>Hedwall, Barbro (2011).

Selma Lagerlöf was a friend of the German-Jewish writer [[Nelly Sachs]]. Shortly before her death in 1940, Lagerlöf intervened with the Swedish royal family to secure the release of Sachs and Sachs' aged mother from Nazi Germany, on the last flight from Germany to Sweden, and their lifelong asylum in Stockholm.<ref name=":0b">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nobel-winners.com/Literature/nelly_sachs.html|title=Nelly Sachs|website=www.nobel-winners.com|access-date=10 December 2018}}</ref>

== Personal life ==

=== Relationships ===
[[File:Sophie Elkan & Selma Lagerlöf.jpg|thumb|Sophie Elkan (right) and Selma Lagerlöf (left)]]In 1894, she met the Swedish writer [[Sophie Elkan]], who became her friend and companion.<ref name="glbtq">{{citation|last=Munck|first=Kerstin|title=Lagerlöf, Selma|url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/lagerlof_s.html|periodical=[[glbtq.com]]|df=dmy-all|year=2002|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116195125/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/lagerlof_s.html|archive-date=16 November 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Over many years, Elkan and Lagerlöf critiqued each other's work. Lagerlöf wrote that Elkan strongly influenced her work and that she often disagreed sharply with the direction Lagerlöf wanted to take in her books.  Selma's letters to Sophie were published in 1993, titled {{Lang|sv|Du lär mig att bli fri}} ('You Teach me to be Free').<ref name="Selma Lagerlof" /> Beginning in the 1900s, she also had a close relationship with [[Valborg Olander]], who had some influence as a literary adviser, agent and secretary of sorts as well; their correspondence was published as {{Lang|sv|En riktig författarhustru}} ('A Proper Writer's Wife').<ref>Toijer-Nilsson, Ying (2006). ''En riktig författarhustru: Selma Lagerlöf skriver till Valborg Olander'' (A Proper Writer's wife: Selma Lagerlöf to Valborg Olander). Bonnier</ref> There appears to have been a strong rivalry between Elkan and Olander while both lived (Elkan died approximately twenty years before the other two women). Both relationships were close, emotional, exclusive and described in terms suggestive of love, the boundary between expressions of friendship and love being somewhat vague at the time. Still, it is primarily the surviving correspondence with Olander that contains passages implying decidedly erotic and physical passion, even though Lagerlöf took care to destroy many of the letters she found too risky.<ref>[https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:740353/FULLTEXT01.pdf Sundberg, Björn. 1996.

Årgång 117 1996.]</ref> Homosexual relations between women were taboo as well as illegal in Sweden at the time, so none of the women involved ever revealed such a thing publicly.<ref name="glbtq"/>

== Literary adaptations ==
[[File:Selma Lagerlof.jpg|thumb|A stairway in [[Jerusalem]] named for Lagerlöf]]
In 1919, Lagerlöf sold all the movie rights to all of her as-yet unpublished works to Swedish Cinema Theatre ({{lang-sv|Svenska Biografteatern}}), so over the years, many movie versions of her works were made. During the era of Swedish silent cinema, her works were used in film by [[Victor Sjöström]], [[Mauritz Stiller]], and other Swedish film makers.<ref>Furhammar, Leif (2010), "Selma Lagerlöf and Literary Adaptations", Mariah Larsson and Anders Marklund (eds), "Swedish Film: An Introduction and Reader", Lund: Nordic Academic Press, pp. 86–91.</ref> Sjöström's retelling of Lagerlöf's tales about rural Swedish life, in which his camera recorded the detail of traditional village life and the Swedish landscape, provided the basis of some of the most poetic and memorable products of silent cinema. ''[[Jerusalem (Lagerlöf novel)|Jerusalem]]'' was adapted in 1996 into an internationally acclaimed film ''Jerusalem''.{{cn|date=December 2020}}
