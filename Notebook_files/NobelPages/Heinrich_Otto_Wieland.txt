'''Heinrich Otto Wieland''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhaɪ̯nʁɪç ˈviːlant|-|De-Heinrich Wieland.ogg}}; 4 June 1877 – 5 August 1957) was a [[Germany|German]] [[chemist]]. He won the 1927 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his research into the [[bile acid]]s.<ref name="frs"/><ref>{{cite journal | author=Bernhard Witkop | title=Remembering Heinrich Wieland (1877-1957) portrait of an organic chemist and founder of modern biochemistry | journal= Medicinal Research Reviews | year=1993 | volume=12 | issue=3 | pages=195–274 | doi=10.1002/med.2610120303 | pmid=1578969| s2cid=32468158 | url=https://zenodo.org/record/1229293 }}</ref>

==Career==
{{more citations needed|section|date=June 2017}}
In 1901 Wieland received his doctorate at the University of Munich while studying under [[Johannes Thiele (chemist)|Johannes Thiele]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}  In 1904 he completed his [[habilitation]], then continued to teach at the university and starting in 1907 was a consultant for [[Boehringer Ingelheim]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} In 1914 he became associate professor for special topics in organic chemistry, and director of the Organic Division of the State Laboratory in Munich. From 1917 to 1918 Wieland worked in the service of the (KWI) [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry]] in [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Dahlem]] then led by [[Fritz Haber]]<ref name=Vaupel/> as an alternative to regular military service. There he was involved in weapons research for instance finding new synthetic routes for [[mustard gas]]. He is also credited with the first synthesis of [[Adamsite]].

From 1913 to 1921, he was Professor at the [[Technical University of Munich]]. He then moved to the [[University of Freiburg]] as successor of [[Ludwig Gattermann]] (he also assumed responsibility for Gattermanns famous cookbook). In Freiburg he started working on toad poisons and bile acids. In association with Boehringer Ingelheim he worked on synthetic alkaloids such as [[morphine]] and [[strychnine]].

In 1925 Wieland succeeded [[Richard Willstätter]] as Chemistry Professor at the [[University of Munich]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1927/wieland-bio.html | title = Heinrich Wieland - Biography}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal| pmid=13464859 | last=Haslewood | first=G.

In 1941, Wieland isolated the toxin [[alpha-amanitin]], the principal active agent of one of the world's most poisonous mushrooms ''[[Amanita phalloides]]''.

Wieland tried successfully to protect people, especially [[Jew]]ish students, who were "racially burdened" after the [[Nuremberg Laws]]. Students who were expelled because they were "racially burdened" could stay in Heinrich Wieland's group as chemists or as "Gäste des Geheimrats" (guests of the privy councillor). [[Hans Conrad Leipelt]], a student of Wieland, was sentenced to death after collecting money for [[Kurt Huber]]'s widow Clara Huber.

==Family==
Heinrich's father, Theodor Wieland (1846–1928) was a pharmacist with a doctorate in chemistry. He owned a gold and silver refinery in Pforzheim.<ref name=Vaupel>''Interconnections and Independence: Heinrich Wieland
(1877–1957) and His Era'' Elisabeth Vaupel [[Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.]] '''2007''', 46, 9154–9179 {{DOI|10.1002/anie.200702255}}</ref> Heinrich Wieland was a cousin of Helene Boehringer, the wife of Albert Boehringer, who was the founder of Boehringer Ingelheim. From 1915 to the end of 1920, he was advisor at Boehringer Ingelheim and during this time he established the first scientific department of the company.

Eva Wieland, Heinrich Wieland's daughter, was married to [[Feodor Felix Konrad Lynen|Feodor Lynen]] on 14 May 1937.

==Heinrich Wieland Prize==
Since 1964, the [[Heinrich Wieland Prize]] has been awarded annually. First to promote research on chemistry, biochemistry, physiology and clinical medicine of lipids and related substances, nowadays the prize is awarded for outstanding research on biologically active molecules and systems in the fields of chemistry, biochemistry, and physiology as well as on their clinical importance. The prize is among the most treasured international science awards and has a successful history of over 50 years. The Heinrich Wieland Prize has been sponsored by Boehringer Ingelheim from 2000 to 2010. From 2011, it has been awarded by the Boehringer Ingelheim Foundation. The awardees have always been selected by an independent Board of Trustees. Since 2014, it has been endowed with 100,000 euros.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heinrich-wieland-prize.de|title=Heinrich Wieland Prize|publisher=Boehringer Ingelheim Stiftung|access-date=2 June 2017}}</ref>
