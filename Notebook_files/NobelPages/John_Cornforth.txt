==Early life and family==
Born in Sydney, Cornforth was the son and the second of four children of English-born, [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]-educated schoolmaster and teacher John Warcup Cornforth and Hilda Eipper (1887–1969), a granddaughter of pioneering missionary and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] minister [[Christopher Eipper]]. Before her marriage, Eipper had been a maternity nurse.<ref name="NNDB" /><ref name="UniSyd">{{cite web |url=http://sydney.edu.au/science/chemistry/aboutus/cornforth.html |title=Sir John Cornforth (1917–2013) |work=University of Sydney, School of Chemistry |access-date=1 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207160559/http://sydney.edu.au/science/chemistry/aboutus/cornforth.html |archive-date=7 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Career==
After his arrival at Oxford and during [[World War II]], Cornforth significantly influenced the work on [[penicillin]], particularly in purifying and concentrating it. Penicillin is usually very unstable in its crude form; as a consequence of this, researchers at the time were building upon [[Howard Florey]]'s work on the drug. In 1940, Cornforth and other chemists measured the yield of penicillin in arbitrary units to understand the conditions that favoured penicillin production and activity, and he contributed to the writing of ''The Chemistry of Penicillin''.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Chemistry of Penicillin |editor-first1= H. T. |editor-last1=Clarke |editor-first2=J. R. |editor-last2=Johnson |editor-first3=R. |editor-last3=Robinson |year=1949 |location=New Jersey |publisher=Princeton University Press}}</ref>

In 1946, the Cornforths, who had by now married, left Oxford and joined the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC), working at the [[National Institute for Medical Research]] (NIMR), where they continued on earlier work in synthesising sterols, including cholesterol. The Cornforths' collaboration with Robinson continued and flourished. In 1951, they completed, simultaneously with [[Robert Burns Woodward]]{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}, the first total synthesis of the non-aromatic steroids. At the NIMR, Cornforth collaborated with numerous biological scientists, including [[George Popják]],<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Professor George Joseph Popjak, MD, DSc, FRS: May 5, 1914 – December 30, 1998 |journal=Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis, and Vascular Biology |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=830 |year=1999 |doi=10.1161/01.ATV.19.4.830|doi-access=free }}</ref> with whom he shared an interest in cholesterol. Together, they received the [[Davy Medal]] in 1968 in recognition of their distinguished joint work on the elucidation of the biosynthetic pathway to polyisoprenoids and steroids. 

While working at the MRC, Cornforth was appointed a Professor at the [[University of Warwick]] and was employed there from 1965 to 1971.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/10547687/Sir-John-Cornforth-obituary.html |title=Sir John Cornforth Obituary |date=9 January 2014 |newspaper=The Independent}}</ref>

In 1975, Cornforth was awarded a share of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, alongside [[Vladimir Prelog]]. In his acceptance speech, Cornforth said:{{quote|Throughout my scientific career my wife has been my most constant collaborator.  Her experimental skill made major contributions to the work; she has eased for me beyond measure the difficulties of communication that accompany deafness; her encouragement and fortitude have been my strongest support.<ref name="Rita Cornforth Fellowships">{{cite web |url=http://wwwrsphysse.anu.edu.au/admin/women/rsc.html |title=Rita Cornforth Fellowships |publisher=[[Australian National University]] |access-date=27 May 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026095350/http://wwwrsphysse.anu.edu.au/admin/women/rsc.html |archive-date=26 October 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>}}

Cornforth's certificate of election for the [[Royal Society]] reads: {{centred pull quote|Distinguished as an Organic Chemist of outstanding originality and exceptional experimental skill, particularly in microchemical manipulation. He was the first to attribute the correct constitution to [[penicillamine]] and to synthesise the amino-acid. After making significant contributions to the synthesis of [[penicillin]] he notably developed the chemistry of the [[oxazole]] group and made oxazole itself for the first time.
The important share he took in the total synthesis of [[androgen]]ic hormones and other [[steroid]]s is gratefully recognised by all his collaborators in the investigation.
Miscellaneous work on [[natural product]]s and [[chemotherapy]] equally displays individual thought, invention, and superlative technical accomplishment.<ref name="royal"/>}}
