Trimble began his career teaching law at [[The Queen's University of Belfast]] in the 1970s, during which time he began to get involved with the paramilitary-linked [[Vanguard Progressive Unionist Party]].

===Political career===
Trimble became involved with the right-wing, paramilitary-linked [[Vanguard Unionist Progressive Party]] (known as Vanguard) in the early 1970s. He ran unsuccessfully for the party in the [[1973 Northern Ireland Assembly election|1973 Assembly election]] for [[North Down (Assembly constituency)|North Down]], coming last.<ref>[http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/cnd.htm North Down 1973–1982] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185624/http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/cnd.htm |date=30 September 2007 }}, Northern Ireland Elections (ARK – Access Research Knowledge)</ref> In 1974, he was a legal adviser to the [[Ulster Workers' Council]] during the successful [[Ulster Workers' Council strike|UWC strike]] against the [[Sunningdale Agreement]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YMTqYuvA10C&pg=PA299 |title=The Routledge Dictionary of Modern British History |access-date=30 June 2010 |isbn=9780415192439 |last1=Plowright |first1=John |year=2006 |archive-date=31 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210831025353/https://books.google.com/books?id=6YMTqYuvA10C&pg=PA299 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Drumcree.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A mural in Northern Ireland supporting the Portadown Orangemen]]
Trimble's election as Leader came in the aftermath of his role in the [[Drumcree conflict]], in which he led a controversial 1995 [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]] Protestant march, amidst Nationalist protest, down the predominantly [[Catholic Church in Ireland|Catholic]] [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] Garvaghy Road in [[Portadown]], [[County Armagh]].<ref name="google4"/><ref name="google3" /> Trimble and [[Democratic Unionist Party]] Leader [[Ian Paisley]] walked hand-in-hand as the march, banned since 1997, proceeded down the road.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/olmedia/1420000/video/_1424111_ireland_murray_jul95_vi.ram Drumcree Parade 1995] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603005337/http://news.bbc.co.uk/olmedia/1420000/video/_1424111_ireland_murray_jul95_vi.ram |date=3 June 2016 }} BBC News</ref> Many Irish Catholics viewed it as insensitive, while many Protestants felt that it was a sign that Trimble was defending them.<ref name="google3" />

==First Minister of Northern Ireland==
Trimble at first opposed the appointment of former U.S. Senator [[George J. Mitchell|George Mitchell]] as the chairman of multi-party talks, but eventually accepted him. The talks resulted in the [[Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement|Good Friday Agreement]] (GFA) of April 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=F5kRAAAAIBAJ&pg=5333,6484937&dq=david-trimble&hl=en|title=Mitchell takes seat in Ulster – and hardliners walk out|work=Deseret News|via=Google News Archive|agency=Associated Press|date=12 June 1996}}{{Dead link|date=September 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Trimble was subsequently seen as instrumental in getting his party to accept the accord.<ref name="telegraph1">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1399874/Key-players.html |title=Key players |work=The Telegraph|location=London |date=25 October 2001 |access-date=30 June 2010 |archive-date=13 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113204831/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1399874/Key-players.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Arguments over the extent of [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] decommissioning led to repeated disruptions during Trimble's tenure as First Minister. In particular:
* The office of First Minister was suspended from 11 February 2000 to 30 May 2000
* Trimble resigned as First Minister on 1 July 2001 due to the continuing impasse arising from the IRA's refusal of his demands that it decommission its arms, as per the commitments all parties had signed up to in section 7 pt. 3 (page 25)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nio.gov.uk/agreement.pdf |title=The Agreement |access-date=3 November 2011|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003065655/http://www.nio.gov.uk/agreement.pdf |archive-date=3 October 2011|publisher=Northern Ireland Office }}</ref> of the 1998 Good Friday Agreement<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/the-long-and-arduous-road-to-paramilitary-decommissioning-14345877.html |title=The long and arduous road to paramilitary decommissioning |work=Belfast Telegraph |date=19 June 2009 |access-date=29 June 2010 |archive-date=24 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624025139/http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/the-long-and-arduous-road-to-paramilitary-decommissioning-14345877.html |url-status=live }}</ref> but he was re-elected on 5 November 2001
* The Assembly was suspended from 14 October 2002 until 2007 due to accusations of an IRA spy ring being operated there (the so-called [[Stormontgate]] Affair)
In 1998, [[Tony Blair]] announced a new judicial inquiry, the [[Bloody Sunday Inquiry]], into the killing of 13 unarmed civil rights marchers in Derry in 1972. A previous investigation, the [[Widgery Tribunal]], into the same event had been discredited. During the debate in the House of Commons, Trimble was one of few dissenting voices. He said "I am sorry to have to say to the Prime Minister that I think that the hope expressed by the Honourable Member for Foyle [John Hume] that this will be part of the healing process is likely to be misplaced.

==Peerage==
At [[2005 United Kingdom general election in Northern Ireland|the general elections of 2005]], Trimble was defeated in Upper Bann by the [[Democratic Unionist Party]]'s [[David Simpson (Northern Ireland politician)|David Simpson]] in his bid for re-election to Parliament in Westminster. The Ulster Unionist Party retained only one seat in Parliament (out of 18 in Northern Ireland) after the 2005 general election, and Trimble resigned the party leadership on 7 May 2005.

On 11 April 2006, it was announced that Trimble would take a seat in the [[House of Lords]] as a working [[life peer]].<ref>{{cite news | title = New working life peers unveiled | date = 11 April 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4896620.stm | access-date = 18 April 2007 | work = BBC News | archive-date = 13 March 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070313144955/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4896620.stm | url-status = live }}</ref> On 21 May 2006 it was announced that he had chosen the geographical designation Lisnagarvey, the original name for his adopted home town of [[Lisburn]]. Subsequently, on 2 June 2006, he was created '''Baron Trimble''', ''of [[Lisnagarvey]] in the [[County Antrim|County of Antrim]]''.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=58004 |date=7 June 2006 |page=7793}}</ref>

On 18 December 2006, he announced that he would be standing down from the Northern Ireland Assembly at the next election.<ref>{{cite news | title = Trimble set to quit assembly seat | date = 18 December 2006 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6189855.stm | access-date = 18 April 2007 | work = BBC News | archive-date = 28 January 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070128211246/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6189855.stm | url-status = live }}</ref>

Trimble was named an Honorary Patron of the [[University Philosophical Society]], [[Trinity College, Dublin]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

On 17 April 2007, Trimble announced he had decided to join the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] in order to have greater influence in politics in the United Kingdom.<ref name="conservatives"/> At the same time, however, he stated that he did not intend to campaign against the Ulster Unionist Party, and proposed the idea of a future alliance between the Conservatives and the Ulster Unionists, similar to that which had existed prior to 1974 and the fallout of the [[Sunningdale Agreement]]. This idea became reality with the formation of the [[electoral alliance]] of [[Ulster Conservatives and Unionists]] in late 2008. It was reported that if the Conservatives won the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]], Trimble would receive a "significant" ministerial role, possibly in the [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]].<ref>{{cite news | title = Lord Trimble lined up as minister in Cameron government | date = 24 July 2008 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/conservative/2455222/Lord-Trimble-lined-up-as-minister-in-Cameron-government.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080821102632/http://telegraph.co.uk./news/newstopics/politics/conservative/2455222/Lord-Trimble-lined-up-as-minister-in-Cameron-government.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 21 August 2008 | access-date =25 July 2008 |work=The Telegraph|location=London }}</ref> In the event, however, Trimble was not offered any governmental or [[British Government frontbench|front bench]] position following the formation of the [[Cameron–Clegg coalition|Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government]].

In May 2010, Trimble joined the [[Friends of Israel Initiative]], a non-Jewish international project supporting Israel's right to exist. The initiative, started by former prime minister of Spain [[José María Aznar]], also included former United States Ambassador to the United Nations [[John R.

In 2016, Trimble supported the [[Leave campaign|Leave side]] in the [[2016 United Kingdom European Union membership referendum|UK referendum on EU membership]]. He said that if he had ever had any doubts about the issue, "his eight years on the EU Select Committees in the House of Lords – which scrutinise the EU's operations – had convinced him of the need to cut ties with Brussels". He cited a study which found that economic growth in the UK reduced after the decision to enter the Common Market, and reduced further when the UK went into the Single Market.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/northern-ireland-news/eu-isn-t-working-on-economic-grounds-trimble-1-7297563|title=EU isn't working on economic grounds: Trimble|publisher=Johnston Publishing|author=Sam McBride|work=The Newsletter|date=26 March 2016|access-date=7 June 2016|archive-date=29 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329003413/http://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/northern-ireland-news/eu-isn-t-working-on-economic-grounds-trimble-1-7297563|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Commission investigated whether Israel's actions in preventing the arrival of ships in Gaza were in accordance with [[international law]].<ref name="autogeneratedil"/> It focused among other things on the security considerations for imposing a [[naval blockade]] on the Gaza Strip and the conformity of the naval blockade with the rules of international law; the conformity of the actions during the raid to principles of international law; and the actions taken by those who organised and participated in the flotilla, and their identities.<ref name="autogeneratedil">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Communiques/2010/Cabinet_to_approve_independent_public_commission_13-Jun-2010.htm |title=Cabinet asked to approve independent public commission |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |date=13 June 2010 |access-date=17 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622080542/http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Communiques/2010/Cabinet_to_approve_independent_public_commission_13-Jun-2010.htm |archive-date=22 June 2010 }}</ref>

==Personal life==
Trimble's first marriage, to Heather McComb in August 1968, ended in divorce in 1976. There were no children from his first marriage. Trimble married a former student, Daphne Elizabeth (née Orr), in August 1978.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} They have two sons and two daughters (Richard, Victoria, Nicholas, and Sarah).<ref name="google1"/> [[Daphne Trimble|Lady Trimble]] served as a member of the [[Equality Commission for Northern Ireland]], and later the [[Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission]], before standing unsuccessfully in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election in Northern Ireland|UK parliamentary election]] of May 2010 for the [[Ulster Conservatives and Unionists]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

His son Nicholas is active within the Ulster Unionist Party.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} In 2016 Nicholas Trimble was co-opted to replace Alexander Redpath as a Councillor representing Downshire West on Lisburn and Castlereagh City Council.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

In July 2019, he admitted that he was "forced" to change his position on same-sex marriage and partnerships after voting against them, because of his lesbian daughter Vicky who married her girlfriend Rosalind Stephens in [[Same-sex marriage in Scotland|Scotland]] in 2017. He told peers in the [[House of Lords]] "I cannot change that, and I cannot now go around saying that I am opposed to it because I acquiesced to it.
