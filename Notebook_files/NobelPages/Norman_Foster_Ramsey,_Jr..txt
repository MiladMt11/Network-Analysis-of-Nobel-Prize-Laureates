'''Norman Foster Ramsey Jr.''' (August 27, 1915 – November 4, 2011) was an [[United States|American]] [[physicist]] who was awarded the 1989 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], for the invention of the separated oscillatory field method, which had important applications in the construction of [[atomic clock]]s. A [[physics]] [[professor]] at [[Harvard University]] for most of his career, Ramsey also held several posts with such [[government]] and international agencies as [[NATO]] and the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]].  Among his other accomplishments are helping to found the [[United States Department of Energy]]'s [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] and [[Fermilab]].

== Early life ==
Norman Foster Ramsey Jr. was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], on August 27, 1915, to Minna Bauer Ramsey, an instructor at the [[University of Kansas]], and Norman Foster Ramsey,<ref name="autobiog">{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1989/ramsey/auto-biography/ |title=Norman F. Ramsey – Autobiography |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |access-date=June 13, 2013}}</ref> a 1905 graduate of the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point]] and an officer in the [[Ordnance Department]] who rose to the rank of [[Brigadier General (United States)|brigadier general]] during [[World War II]], commanding the [[Rock Island Arsenal]].{{sfn|Cullum|1950|p=101}} He was raised as an [[Military brat (U.S. subculture)|Army brat]], frequently moving from post to post, and lived in France for a time when his father was Liaison Officer with the ''Direction d'Artillerie'' and Assistant [[Military Attaché]].{{sfn|Cullum|1930|pp=669-670}} This allowed him to skip a couple of grades along the way, so that he graduated from [[Leavenworth High School]] in [[Leavenworth, Kansas]], at the age of 15.<ref name="autobiog" />

Ramsey's parents hoped that he would go to West Point, but at 15, he was too young to be admitted. He was awarded a scholarship to the [[University of Kansas]], but in 1930 his father was posted to [[Governors Island]], New York.<ref name="autobiog" />{{sfn|Cullum|1940|pp=167-168}} Ramsey therefore entered [[Columbia University]] in 1931, and began studying [[engineering]]. He became interested in [[mathematics]], and switched to this as his [[academic major]]. By the time he received his [[B.A.]] from Columbia in 1935, he had become interested in [[physics]].<ref name="autobiog" /><ref name="nndb">{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/028/000099728/ |title=Norman F. Ramsey |publisher=Soylent Communications |access-date=June 11, 2013 }}</ref> Columbia awarded him a [[Kellett Fellowship]] to [[Cambridge University]] where he studied physics at [[Cavendish Laboratory]] under [[Lord Rutherford]] and [[Maurice Goldhaber]], and encountered notable physicists including [[Edward Victor Appleton|Edward Appleton]], [[Max Born]], [[Edward Bullard]], [[James Chadwick]], [[John Cockcroft]], [[Paul Dirac]], [[Arthur Eddington]], [[Ralph Howard Fowler|Ralph Fowler]], [[Mark Oliphant]] and [[J.J. Thomson]].<ref name="autobiog" /> At Cambridge, he took the [[tripos]] in order to study [[quantum mechanics]], which had not been covered at Columbia, resulting in being awarded a second B.A. degree by Cambridge.<ref name="IEEE" />

A term paper Ramsey wrote for Goldhaber on [[magnetic moment]]s caused him to read recent papers on the subject by [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]],<ref name="IEEE" /> and this stimulated an interest in [[molecular beam]]s, and in doing research for a [[Ph.D.]] under Rabi at Columbia.<ref name="autobiog" /><ref name="Guardian">{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |title=Norman Ramsey obituary |first=Anthony |last=Tucker |date=November 18, 2011 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/nov/18/norman-ramsey | access-date=February 13, 2010 }}</ref> Soon after Ramsey arrived at Columbia, Rabi invented [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|molecular beam resonance spectroscopy]], for which he was awarded the [[Nobel prize in physics]] in 1944.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1944/rabi.html |title=Isidor Isaac Rabi |access-date=August 17, 2012 |publisher=Nobel Media }}</ref> Ramsey was part of Rabi's team that also included [[Jerome Kellogg]], [[Polykarp Kusch]], [[Sidney Millman]] and [[Jerrold Zacharias]].

== World War II ==

=== Radiation laboratory ===
[[File:P-61 from above.jpg|right|thumb|The Northrop P-61 Black Widow [[night fighter]] was specifically designed to take advantage of the new radar]]
In 1940, he married Elinor Jameson of [[Brooklyn, New York]], and accepted a teaching position at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]]. The two expected to spend the rest of their lives there, but World War II intervened.<ref name="autobiog" /> In September 1940 the British [[Tizard Mission]] brought a number of new technologies to the United States, including a [[cavity magnetron]], a high-powered device that generates [[microwave]]s using the interaction of a stream of [[electron]]s with a [[magnetic field]], which promised to revolutionize [[radar]]. [[Alfred Lee Loomis]] of the [[National Defense Research Committee]] established the [[Radiation Laboratory]]  at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] to develop this technology.{{sfn|Conant|2002|pp=209–213}} Ramsey was one of the scientists recruited by Rabi for this work.{{sfn|Conant|2002|p=204}}

Initially, Ramsey was in Rabi's magnetron group. When Rabi became a division head, Ramsey became the group leader.<ref name="IEEE" /> The role of the group was to develop the magnetron to permit a reduction in [[wavelength]] from {{convert|150|cm}} to {{convert|10|cm}}, and then to {{convert|3|cm}} or X-Band. Microwave radar promised to be small, lighter and more efficient than older types.{{sfn|Rigden|1987|pp=135–135}} Ramsey's group started with the design produced by Oliphant's team in Britain, and attempted to improve it. The Radiation Laboratory produced the designs, which were prototyped by [[Raytheon]], and then tested by the laboratory. In June 1941, Ramsey travelled to Britain, where he met with Oliphant, and the two exchanged ideas. He brought back some British components which were incorporated into the final design. A [[night fighter]] aircraft, the [[Northrop P-61 Black Widow]], was designed around the new radar. Ramsey returned to Washington in late 1942 as an adviser on the use of the new 3&nbsp;cm microwave radar sets that were now coming into service,<ref name="Guardian" /> working for [[Edward L. Bowles]] in the office of the [[Secretary of War]], [[Henry L. Stimson]].<ref name="IEEE" />

=== Manhattan Project ===
In 1943, Ramsey was approached by [[Robert Oppenheimer]] and [[Robert Bacher]], who asked him to join the [[Manhattan Project]]. Ramsey agreed to do so, but the intervention of the Project director, Brigadier General [[Leslie R. Groves Jr.]], was necessary in order to prise him away from the Secretary of War's office. A compromise was agreed to, whereby Ramsey remained on the payroll of the Secretary of War, and was merely seconded to the Manhattan Project.<ref name="IEEE" />{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=59}}{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=378-379}} In October 1943, Group E-7 of the Ordnance Division was created at the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] with Ramsey as group leader, with the task of integrating the design and delivery of the [[nuclear weapon]]s being built by the laboratory.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=378-379}}

[[File:Ramsey signs the Fat man.jpg|thumb|left|Ramsey signs the [[Fat Man]] used at Nagasaki]]
The first thing he had to do was determine the characteristics of the aircraft that would be used. There were only two [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] aircraft large enough: the British [[Avro Lancaster]] and the US [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]].{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=378-379}} The United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) wanted to use the B-29 if at all possible, even though it required substantial modification.{{sfn|Groves|1962|p=254}} Ramsey supervised the test drop program, which began at [[Naval Surface Warfare Center Dahlgren Division|Dahlgren, Virginia]], in August 1943, before moving to [[Edwards Air Force Base|Muroc Dry Lake, California]], in March 1944. Mock ups of [[Thin Man nuclear bomb|Thin Man]] and [[Fat Man]] bombs were dropped and tracked by an [[SCR-584]] ground-based radar set of the kind that Ramsey had helped develop at the Radiation laboratory. Numerous problems were discovered with the bombs and the aircraft modifications, and corrected.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=380-382}}

Plans for the delivery of the weapons in combat were assigned to the Weapons Committee, which was chaired by Ramsey, and answerable to [[Captain (United States O-6)|Captain]] [[William S. Parsons]].{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|p=248}} Ramsey drew up tables of organization and equipment for the [[Project Alberta]] detachment that would accompany the USAAF's [[509th Composite Group]] to [[Tinian]]. Ramsey briefed the 509th's commander, Lieutenant Colonel [[Paul W. Tibbets]], on the nature of the mission when the latter assumed command of the 509th.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=387-388}} Ramsey went to Tinian with the Project Alberta detachment as Parsons's scientific and technical deputy. He was involved in the assembly of the Fat Man bomb, and relayed Parsons's message indicating the success of the [[bombing of Hiroshima]] to Groves in Washington, D.C.{{sfn|Hoddeson|Henriksen|Meade|Westfall|1993|pp=392-393}}

== Research ==
At the end of the war, Ramsey returned to Columbia as a professor and research scientist.<ref name="autobiog" /> Rabi and Ramsey picked up where they had left off before the war with their molecular beam experiments. Ramsey and his first graduate student, [[William Nierenberg]], measured various nuclear [[magnetic dipole]] and [[electric quadrupole]] moments. With Rabi, he helped establish the [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]] on [[Long Island]]. In 1946, he became the first head of the Physics Department there. His time there was brief, for in 1947, he joined the physics faculty at [[Harvard University]], where he would remain for the next 40 years, except for brief visiting professorships at [[Middlebury College]], [[Oxford University]], [[Mt. Holyoke College]] and the [[University of Virginia]]. During the 1950s, he was the first science adviser to [[NATO]], and initiated a series of fellowships, grants and summer school programs to train European scientists.<ref name="autobiog" /><ref name="IEEE">{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Oral-History:Norman_F._Ramsey_%281991%29 |title=Norman F.

Ramsey's research in the immediate post-war years looked at measuring fundamental properties of atoms and molecules by use of molecular beams. On moving to Harvard, his objective was to carry out accurate molecular beam magnetic resonance experiments, based on the techniques developed by Rabi. However, the accuracy of the measurements depended on the uniformity of the magnetic field, and Ramsey found that it was difficult to create sufficiently uniform magnetic fields. He developed the separated oscillatory field method in 1949 as a means of achieving the accuracy he wanted.<ref name="autobiog" />

Ramsey and his PhD student [[Daniel Kleppner]] developed the atomic hydrogen [[maser]], looking to increase the accuracy with which the [[Hyperfine structure|hyperfine]] separations of atomic [[hydrogen]], [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]] could be measured, as well as to investigate how much the hyperfine structure was affected by external magnetic and electric fields. He also participated in developing an extremely stable clock based on a hydrogen maser. From 1967 until 2019, [[2019 redefinition of SI base units|the second has been defined]] based on  9,192,631,770  hyperfine transition of a [[cesium-133]] atom; the [[atomic clock]] which is used to set this standard is an application of Ramsey's work.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1989/press.html |title=Nobel Prize press release |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |access-date=June 13, 2013}}</ref> He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1989 "for the invention of the separated oscillatory fields method and its use in the hydrogen maser and other atomic clocks".<ref name="Nobel">{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1989/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1989|publisher=The Nobel Foundation |access-date=June 13, 2013}}</ref> The Prize was shared with [[Hans G. Dehmelt]] and [[Wolfgang Paul]].<ref name="Nobel" />

In collaboration with the [[Institut Laue–Langevin]], Ramsey also worked on applying similar methods to beams of neutrons, measuring the [[neutron magnetic moment]] and finding a limit to its [[neutron electric dipole moment|electric dipole moment]].<ref name="autobiog" /> As President of the [[Universities Research Association]] during the 1960s he was involved in the design and construction of the [[Fermilab]] in [[Batavia, Illinois]].<ref name="autobiog" /><ref name="National Geographic" /><ref name="obit" /> He also headed a 1982 [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] committee that concluded that, contrary to the findings of the [[House of Representatives Select Committee on Assassinations]], [[John F. Kennedy assassination Dictabelt recording|acoustic evidence did not indicate the presence of a second gunman's involvement]] in the [[assassination of President John F. Kennedy]].<ref name="obit" />

== Later life ==
Ramsey eventually became the [[Eugene Higgins professor of physics]] at Harvard and retired in 1986. However, he remained active in physics, spending a year as a research fellow at the  [[Joint Institute for Laboratory Astrophysics]] (JILA) at the [[University of Colorado]]. He also continued  visiting professorships at the [[University of Chicago]], [[Williams College]] and the [[University of Michigan]]. In addition to the Nobel Prize in Physics, Ramsey received a number of awards, including the [[Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award]] in 1960, [[Davisson-Germer Prize]] in 1974, the [[IEEE Medal of Honor]] in 1984, the [[I. I. Rabi Award|Rabi Prize]] in 1985, the [[Rumford Prize|Rumford Premium Prize]] in 1985, the  Compton Medal in 1986, and the [[Oersted Medal]] and the [[National Medal of Science]] in 1988.<ref name="autobiog" />  In 1990, Ramsey received the Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Golden Plate Awardees of the American Academy of Achievement |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://achievement.org/our-history/golden-plate-awards/#science-exploration}}</ref> In 2004, he signed a letter along with 47 other [[Nobel laureate]]s endorsing [[John Kerry]] for President of the United States as someone who would "restore science to its appropriate place in government".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~action/2004/kerry/kerrynobel062104.html |publisher=[[George Washington University]] |title=48 Nobel Winning Scientists Endorse Kerry-June 21, 2004 |access-date=July 6, 2013}}</ref>

His first wife, Elinor, died in 1983, after which he married Ellie Welch of Brookline, Massachusetts. Ramsey died on November 4, 2011. He was survived by his wife Ellie, his four daughters from his first marriage, and his stepdaughter and stepson from his second marriage.<ref name="Guardian" /><ref name="obit">{{cite news |title=Norman Ramsey Dies at 96; Work Led to the Atomic Clock |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/07/us/norman-ramsey-dies-at-96-work-led-to-the-atomic-clock.html?ref=obituaries |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=November 6, 2011 |access-date=November 7, 2011 }}</ref>
