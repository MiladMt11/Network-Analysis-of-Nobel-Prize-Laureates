'''Jean-Pierre Sauvage''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃pjɛʁ sovaʒ}}; born 21 October 1944) is a French [[coordination chemistry|coordination chemist]] working at [[University of Strasbourg|Strasbourg University]].  He graduated from the National School of Chemistry of Strasbourg (now known as [[Ecole européenne de chimie, polymères et matériaux|ECPM Strasbourg]]), in 1967.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://asso-aics.unistra.fr/accueil/jean-pierre-sauvage.html | title=Jean-Pierre Sauvage, Nobel de Chimie – AICS}}</ref> He has specialized in [[supramolecular chemistry]] for which he has been awarded the 2016 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] along with [[J. Fraser Stoddart|Sir J. Fraser Stoddart]] and [[Ben Feringa|Bernard L. Feringa]].

==Biography==
Sauvage was born in Paris in 1944,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2016/sauvage-facts.html|title=Jean-Pierre Sauvage – Facts|date=5 October 2016|publisher=Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences|access-date=9 October 2016}}</ref> and earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree from the [[Université Louis-Pasteur]] under the supervision of [[Jean-Marie Lehn]], himself a 1987 laureate of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. During his doctoral work, he contributed to the first syntheses of the [[cryptand]] ligands.<ref>{{cite journal|first=B.|last=Dietrich|first2=J. M.|last2=Lehn|first3=J.P.|last3=Sauvage|title=Les Cryptates|journal=Tetrahedron Letters|year=1969|volume=10|issue=34|pages=2889–92|doi=10.1016/S0040-4039(01)88300-3}}</ref> After postdoctoral research with [[M. L. H. Green|Malcolm L. H. Green]], he returned to [[Strasbourg]], where he is now emeritus professor.

Sauvage's scientific work has focused on creating molecules that mimic the functions of machines by changing their conformation in response to an external signal.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.leru.org/index.php/public/news/jean-pierre-sauvage-university-of-strasbourg-nobel-laureate-for-chemistry|title=Jean-Pierre Sauvage, University of Strasbourg, Nobel laureate for chemistry|date=7 October 2016|publisher=League of European Research Universities|access-date=9 October 2016}}</ref>

His Nobel Prize work was done in 1983, when he was the first to synthesize a [[catenane]], a complex of two [[Mechanically interlocked molecular architectures|interlocking ring-shaped molecules]], which were [[Mechanical bond|bonded mechanically]] rather than chemically.  Because these two rings can move relative to each other, the Nobel Prize cited this as a vital initial effort towards making [[molecular machine]].  The other two recipients of the prize followed up by later creating a [[rotaxane]] and a [[Synthetic molecular motor|molecular rotor]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2016/press.html|title=The 2016 Nobel Prize in Chemistry – Press Release|date=5 October 2016|publisher=Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences|access-date=9 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Noorden|first=Richard|last2=Castelvecchi|first2=Davide|date=5 October 2016|title=World's tiniest machines win chemistry Nobel|journal=Nature|volume=538|issue=7624|doi=10.1038/nature.2016.20734|pages=152–153|pmid=27734892|bibcode=2016Natur.538..152V|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Other research includes [[Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide|electrochemical reduction of CO<sub>2</sub>]] and models of the [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] reaction center.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Collin|first=J.P.|last2=Sauvage|first2=J.-P.|title=Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide mediated by molecular catalysts|journal=Coord. Chem. Rev.|year=1989|volume=93|issue=2|pages=245–68|doi=10.1016/0010-8545(89)80018-9}}</ref>

A large theme of his work is molecular [[Topoisomer|topology]], specifically [[mechanically-interlocked molecular architectures]]. He has described syntheses of [[catenane]]s and [[molecular knot]]s based on coordination complexes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dietrich-Buchecker|first=C.|last2=Jimenez-Molero|first2=M.C.|last3=Sartor|first3=V.|last4=Sauvage|first4=J.-P.|title=Rotaxanes and catenanes as prototypes of molecular machines and motors|journal=Pure and Applied Chemistry|year=2003|volume=75|issue=10|pages=1383–93|doi=10.1351/pac200375101383 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

He was elected a correspondent member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] on 26 March 1990, and became a member on 24 November 1997. He is currently emeritus professor at the [[University of Strasbourg]] (Unistra).<ref>[https://isis.unistra.fr/laboratoire-de-chimie-organo-minerale-jean-pierre-sauvage/ Laboratoire de Chimie Organo-Minérale (Jean-Pierre SAUVAGE)], ''isis.unistra.fr.''

He shared the 2016 Nobel Prize in Chemistry "for the design and synthesis of [[molecular machine]]s" with [[Fraser Stoddart|Sir J. Fraser Stoddart]] and [[Ben Feringa|Bernard L.
