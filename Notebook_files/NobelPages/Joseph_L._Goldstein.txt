'''Joseph Leonard Goldstein''' [[Foreign Member of the Royal Society|ForMemRS]] (born April 18, 1940) is an American [[biochemist]].  He received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1985, along with fellow [[University_of_Texas_Southwestern_Medical_Center|University of Texas Southwestern]] researcher, [[Michael Stuart Brown|Michael Brown]], for their studies regarding [[cholesterol]].<ref name="NobelFaces">Badge, Peter (2007) "Joseph Goldstein".

[[John Wiley & Sons]]. {{ISBN|9783527406784}}. p 300.</ref> They discovered that human cells have [[low-density lipoprotein]] (LDL) receptors that remove [[cholesterol]] from the blood and that when [[LDL receptor]]s are not present in sufficient numbers, individuals develop [[hypercholesterolemia]] and become at risk for cholesterol related diseases, notably [[coronary heart disease]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1_XIbBRvD0gC&pg=PA315 Encyclopedia of Global Health, Volume 1] by Luca Prono, edited by Yawei Zhang</ref> Their studies led to the development of [[statin]] drugs.<ref name="NobelFaces" />

==Life and career==
Goldstein was born in Kingstree, South Carolina, the son of Fannie (Alpert) and Isadore E. Goldstein, who owned a clothing store. Goldstein received his BSci from [[Washington and Lee University]] in 1962, and his MD from the University of Texas [[University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center|Southwestern Medical School]] in 1966.<ref name="NobelFaces" /> Upon completion of his [[Residency (medicine)|residency]], Goldstein moved to the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], where he worked in [[Molecular biology|biochemical genetics]].<ref name="Tonse">{{Cite journal | last1 = Raju | first1 = T.

At the Southwestern Medical Center Goldstein collaborated extensively with [[Michael Stuart Brown|Michael Brown]], a fellow researcher at the center who had also worked at the NIH.<ref name="Tonse" /> From 1973 to 1985, Goldstein and Brown together published over one hundred major papers.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=IPwdiYjrNMEC&pg=PA105 The Cholesterol Wars: The Skeptics Vs. the Preponderance of Evidence] By Daniel Steinberg</ref> They are both listed in [[Thomson Reuters]]’ index of highly cited authors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://highlycited.com/|title=Highly Cited Researchers - The Most Influential Scientific Minds|website=highlycited.com|access-date=23 March 2018}}</ref> Frequently mentioned as a candidate for nationally prominent positions in scientific administration, Goldstein, like his colleague Michael Brown, chose to continue hands-on research.<ref>Culliton BJ.

In 1993, their postdoctoral trainees, [[Xiaodong Wang (biochemist)|Wang Xiaodong]] and [http://www.woodlandbiosciences.com/ Michael Briggs], purified the [[Sterol regulatory element-binding protein|Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Proteins]] (SREBPs), a family of membrane-bound transcription factors. Since 1993,  Goldstein, Brown, and their colleagues have described the unexpectedly complex machinery that proteolytically releases the SREBPs from membranes, thus allowing their migration to the nucleus where they activate all the genes involved in the synthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids. The machinery for generating active SREBPs is tightly regulated by a negative feedback mechanism, which explains how cells maintain the necessary levels of fats and cholesterol in the face of varying environmental circumstances.<ref>Wang X, Sato R, Brown MS, Hua X, Goldstein JL.

==Essays on "The Art of Science"==

Since 2000, Goldstein has authored a series of essays considering science as a creative pursuit, and explores the links between the art and science.  The essays appear in the journal Nature Medicine, and coincide with the annual announcement of the Lasker Awards, with which Goldstein is affiliated in the capacity of jury chairman.
