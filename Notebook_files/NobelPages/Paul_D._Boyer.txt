'''Paul Delos Boyer''' (July 31, 1918 – June 2, 2018) was an American [[biochemist]], [[analytical chemist]], and a professor of chemistry at [[University of California Los Angeles]] (UCLA). He shared the 1997 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for [[research]] on the "[[enzyme|enzymatic]] mechanism underlying the [[biosynthesis]] of [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP)" ([[ATP synthase]]) with [[John E. Walker]], making Boyer the first [[Utah]]-born Nobel laureate; the remainder of the Prize in that year was awarded to Danish chemist [[Jens Christian Skou]] for his discovery of the [[Na+/K+-ATPase]].<ref name="nobel 1997"/>

==Birth and education==
Boyer was born in [[Provo, Utah]]. He grew up in a nonpracticing Mormon family. He attended [[Provo High School]], where he was active in [[student government]] and the debating team. He received a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in [[chemistry]] from [[Brigham Young University]] in 1939 and obtained a Wisconsin Alumni Research [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|Foundation]] [[Scholarship]] for graduate studies. Five days before leaving for [[Wisconsin]], Paul married Lyda Whicker in 1939, and they remained married for nearly eighty years until his death in 2018, making him the longest-married Nobel laureate.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/obituaries/paul-d-boyer-99-dies-nobel-chemistry-winner-studied-what-makes-the-body-go.html|title=Paul D. Boyer, 99, Dies; Nobel Winner Decoded Enzyme That Powers Life|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en}}</ref> The Boyers had three children.

Though the Boyers connected with the Mormon community in [[Wisconsin]], they considered themselves "on the wayward fringe" and doubted the doctrinal claims of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church).  After experimenting with [[Unitarianism]], Boyer eventually became an [[atheist]].<ref>{{Citation | author=Boyer, Paul D. | title=A Path to Atheism | date=March 2004 | journal=Freethought Today | publisher=[[Freedom From Religion Foundation]] | volume=21 | issue=2 | url=http://www.ffrf.org/legacy/fttoday/2004/march/?ft=boyer | access-date=March 16, 2010 | postscript=. | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603071651/http://ffrf.org/legacy/fttoday/2004/march/?ft=boyer | archive-date=June 3, 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2003 he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the [[Humanism and Its Aspirations|Humanist Manifesto]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://americanhumanist.org/what-is-humanism/manifesto3/signers/ | title=Notable Signers | publisher=American Humanist Association | work=Humanism and Its Aspirations | access-date=September 15, 2012}}</ref>

==Academic career==
After Boyer received his [[Doctorate of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in [[biochemistry]] from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1943, he spent years at [[Stanford University]] on a war-related research project dedicated to stabilization of serum albumin for transfusions. He began his independent research career at the [[University of Minnesota]] and introduced kinetic, isotopic, and chemical methods for investigating [[enzyme]] mechanisms. In 1955, he received a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] and worked with [[Professor]] [[Hugo Theorell]] on the mechanism of [[alcohol dehydrogenase]]. In 1956, he accepted a Hill Foundation Professorship and moved to the medical campus of the [[University of Minnesota]]. In 1959-1960, he served as [[Chairman]] of the Biochemistry Section of the [[American Chemical Society]] (ACS) and in 1969-1970 as [[President (corporate title)|President]] of the American Society of Biological Chemists.

Since 1963, he had been a Professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. In 1965, he became the Founding Director of the [[Molecular biology|Molecular Biology]] Institute and spearheaded the construction of the building and the organization of an interdepartmental Ph.D. program. This institutional service did not diminish the creativity and originality of his research program, which led to three postulates for the binding mechanism for [[ATP synthesis]]—that energy input was not used primarily to form ATP but to promote the binding of [[phosphate]] and mostly the release of tightly bound ATP; that three identical catalytic sites went through compulsory, sequential binding changes; and that the binding changes of the catalytic subunits, circularly arranged on the periphery of the enzyme, were driven by the rotation of a smaller internal [[Protein subunit|subunit]].

Paul Boyer was [[Editing|Editor]] or Associate Editor of the ''[[Annual Review of Biochemistry]]'' from 1963-1989. He was Editor of the classic series, "The Enzymes". In 1981, he was Faculty Research Lecturer at UCLA. In that same year, he was awarded the prestigious [[Tolman Award|Tolman Medal]] by the Southern California Section of the [[American Chemical Society]].

==Death==
Boyer died of [[respiratory failure]] on June 2, 2018 at the age of 99, less than two months shy of his 100th birthday at his [[Los Angeles]] home.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wolpert |first1=Stuart |title=In memoriam: Paul Boyer, 99, Nobel laureate in chemistry |url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/in-memoriam:-paul-boyer-99-nobel-laureate-in-chemistry |website=UCLA Newsroom |publisher=University of California, Los Angeles |access-date=June 5, 2018 |date=June 4, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/obituaries/paul-d-boyer-99-dies-nobel-chemistry-winner-studied-what-makes-the-body-go.html |title=Paul D.
