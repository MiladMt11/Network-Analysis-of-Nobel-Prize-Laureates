==Career and research==
Levi-Montalcini lost her assistant position in the anatomy department after a 1938 law barring Jews from university positions was passed.<ref>Yount, Lisa, ''Twentieth-Century Women Scientists'', Facts on File, Inc., 1996, p. 29, {{ISBN|0-8160-3173-8}}{{unreliable source?|date=May 2018}}</ref> During World War II she set up a laboratory in her bedroom and studied the growth of nerve fibers in chicken embryos, which laid the groundwork for much of her later research. She described this experience decades later in the science [[documentary film]] ''[[Death by Design/The Life and Times of Life and Times]]'' (1997).<ref>{{cite web|title=Death by Design: Where Parallel Worlds Meet|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118947/fullcredits#cast|publisher=IMDb|access-date=31 December 2012}}</ref> The film also features her fraternal [[twin]] sister [[Paola Levi-Montalcini|Paola]], who became a respected artist best known for her aluminum sculptures designed to bring light to the rooms due to the reflective white surface.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Di Genova |first1=Giorgio |title=Paola Levi-Montalcini |url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/levi-montalcini-paola |website=Jewish Women's Archive}}</ref>

When the Germans invaded Italy in September 1943, her family fled south to [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], where they survived the [[Holocaust]], under false identities, protected by some non-Jewish friends.<ref>"[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/rita-levi-montalcini_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ Rita Levi Montalcini]", Treccani.it.</ref> In her hiding place, she set up a laboratory in a corner of their shared living space. During the Nazi occupation, Levi-Montalcini was in contact with the partisans of the [[Action Party (Italy)|Action Party]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ebri.it/en/pagine/1_biografia_2_biography_30|title = EBRI - European Brain Research Institute}}</ref> After the liberation of Florence in August 1944, she volunteered her medical expertise for the Allied health service. Her family returned to Turin in 1945.

In September 1946, Levi-Montalcini was granted a one-semester research fellowship in the laboratory of Professor [[Viktor Hamburger]] at [[Washington University in St. Louis]]; he was interested in two of the articles Levi-Montalcini had published in foreign scientific journals.<ref name="beckerexhibits.wustl.edu">{{cite web |url=http://beckerexhibits.wustl.edu/mowihsp/bios/levi_montalcini.htm|title=Missouri Women in the Health Sciences - Biographies - Rita Levi-Montalcini}}</ref> After she duplicated the results of her home laboratory experiments, Hamburger offered her a research associate position, which she held for 30 years. It was there that, in 1952, she did her most important work: isolating [[nerve growth factor]] (NGF) from observations of certain cancerous tissues that cause extremely rapid growth of nerve cells.<ref name="fox1">{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/12/30/nobel-winning-scientist-levi-montalcini-dies-in-rome-at-103-biologist-studied/|title=Nobel-winning scientist Levi-Montalcini dies in Rome at 103, biologist studied growth factor|date=30 December 2012|publisher=Fox News Channel}}</ref> By transferring pieces of tumors to chick embryos, Montalcini established a mass of cells that was full of nerve fibers. The discovery of nerves growing everywhere like a halo around the tumor cells was surprising. When describing it, Montalcini said it is: "like rivulets of water flowing steadily over a bed of stones."<ref name=makersmodernsci>{{cite book|last=Yount|first=Lisa|title=Rita Levi-Montalcini: Discoverer of Nerve Growth Factor|year=2009|publisher=Chelsea House}}{{unreliable source?|date=May 2018}}</ref> The nerve growth produced by the tumor was unlike anything she had seen before – the nerves took over areas that would become other tissues and even entered veins in the embryo. But nerves did not grow into the arteries, which would flow from the embryo back to the tumor. This suggested to Montalcini that the tumor itself was releasing a substance that was stimulating the growth of nerves.

She was made a full professor in 1958. In 1962, she established a second laboratory in [[Rome]] and divided her time between there and St. Louis. In 1963, she became the first woman to receive the Max Weinstein Award (given by the United Cerebral Palsy Association) due to her significant contributions into neurological research.<ref name="beckerexhibits.wustl.edu"/>

From 1961 to 1969, she directed the Research Center of Neurobiology of the [[Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche|CNR]] (Rome), and from 1969 to 1978, the Laboratory of Cellular Biology.<ref name="fox1"/> After she retired in 1977, she was appointed as director of the Institute of Cell Biology of the Italian National Council of Research in Rome. She later retired from that position in 1979, however continued to be involved as a guest professor.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wasserman|first1=Elga R.|title=The door in the dream : conversations with eminent women in science|date=2000|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|isbn=0-309-06568-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/doorindream00elga/page/41 41]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/doorindream00elga/page/41}}</ref>

Controversies were raised about the cooperation of Levi-Montalcini with the Italian pharmaceutical industry Fidia. While working for Fidia, she improved the understanding of [[gangliosides]]. Beginning in 1975, she supported the drug Cronassial (a particular mixture of gangliosides) produced by Fidia from bovine [[brain]] tissue. Independent studies showed that the drug actually could be successful in treatment of intended diseases ([[peripheral neuropathies]]).<ref>{{cite book |author=Horowitz SH |title=Ganglioside Structure, Function, and Biomedical Potential |chapter=Ganglioside (Cronassial) therapy in diabetic neuropathy |volume=174 |pages=593–600 |year=1984 |pmid=6377852 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4684-1200-0_50|series=Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology |isbn=978-1-4684-1202-4 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Staughton RC, Good J |title=Double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of a mixture of gangliosides ('Cronassial') in post-herpetic neuralgia |journal=Current Medical Research and Opinion |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=169–76 |year=1990 |pmid=2272191 |doi=10.1185/03007999009111498}}</ref> Years later, some patients under treatment with Cronassial reported a severe neurological syndrome ([[Guillain–Barré syndrome]]). As per the normal cautionary routine, Germany banned Cronassial in 1983, followed by other countries. Italy prohibited the drug only in 1993; at the same time, an investigation revealed that Fidia paid the Italian Ministry of Health for a quick approval of Cronassial and later paid for pushing use of the drug in treatment of diseases where it had not been tested.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dmi.unipg.it/~mamone/univ/QUALIT.htm|title=Qualità Intellettuale|publisher=UNIPG|access-date=16 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dica33.it/argomenti/farmacologia/farmacovigilanza/farmacovigilanza2.asp|title=Fallimenti storici|publisher=Dica33|access-date=16 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://politicamolecolare.blogspot.com/2007/11/rita-levi-di-montalcini-e-i.html|title=Rita Levi Montalcini e la vicenda Cronossial|publisher=Politica Molecolare|date=November 2011}}</ref> Levi-Montalcini's relationship with the company was revealed during the investigation, and she was criticized publicly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/1994/02/22/nobel-comprato-non-ne-so-nulla.html|title=Nobel comprato?

Levi-Montalcini earned a Nobel Prize along with Stanley Cohen in 1986 in the physiology or medicine category. The two earned their Nobel Prizes for their research in to the nerve growth factor (NGF), the protein that causes cell growth due to stimulated nerve tissue.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.famousscientists.org/rita-levi-montalcini/|title=Rita Levi-Montalcini - Biography, Facts and Pictures}}</ref>

==Political career==
On 1 August 2001, she was appointed as [[Senator for Life]] by the [[President of Italy]], [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]].<ref name=Sen/>

On 28–29 April 2006, Levi-Montalcini, aged 97, attended the opening assembly of the newly elected Senate, at which the President of the Senate was elected. She declared her preference for the centre-left candidate [[Franco Marini]]. Due to her support of the government of [[Romano Prodi]], she was often criticized by some right-wing senators, who accused her of saving the government when the government's exiguous majority in the Senate was at risk. Her old age was mocked by far-right politician [[Francesco Storace]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2007/10/sezioni/politica/napolitano-tre/mastella-storace/mastella-storace.html |title=Mastella: sì al procedimento su Storace|work=la Repubblica|date=17 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2008/04/sezioni/politica/elezioni-2008/montalcini/montalcini.html |title=Dispetto alla Montalcini al seggio|publisher=La Repubblica|date=14 April 2008}}</ref>

Levi-Montalcini's father, Adamo Levi, was an electrical engineer and mathematician, and her mother, Adele Montalcini, was a painter.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rita Levi-Montalcini- Biography |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1986/levi-montalcini/auto-biography/ |website=The Nobel Prize}}</ref> The family's Jewish roots extend back to the Roman Empire; due to the family's strict and traditional background, Adamo was not supportive of women attending college as it would intrude in their ability to tend to the children and house.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Elliott |first1=Ellen |title=Women in Science: Rita Levi-Montalcini (1909–2012) |url=https://www.jax.org/news-and-insights/jax-blog/2017/april/rita-levi-montalcini |website=The Jackson Library}}</ref>

[[File:Rita Levi Montalcini.jpg|thumbnail|Rita Levi-Montalcini in 2009]]
Levi-Montalcini had an older brother [[Gino Levi-Montalcini|Gino]], who died after a [[heart attack]] in 1974. He was one of the best-known contemporary Italian [[architects]] and a professor at the [[University of Turin]]. She had two sisters: Anna, five years older than Rita, and [[Paola Levi-Montalcini|Paola]], her twin sister, a popular artist who died on 29 September 2000, age 91.

In 2003, she filed a libel suit for defamation against [[Beppe Grillo]]. During a show, Grillo called the 94-year-old woman an "old whore".<ref>{{cite web|author=Gian Marco Chiocci |url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/news/vaffa-e-condanne-camere-tab-grillo.html|title=Tra "vaffa" e condanne, Camere tabù per Grillo|date=5 October 2007|language=it|publisher=[[Il Giornale]]|access-date=29 December 2012}}</ref>

Upon her death, the Mayor of Rome, [[Gianni Alemanno]], stated it was a great loss "for all of humanity." He praised her as someone who represented "civic conscience, culture and the spirit of research of our time." Italian astrophysicist [[Margherita Hack]] told Sky TG24 TV in a tribute to her fellow scientist, "She is really someone to be admired." Italy's premier, [[Mario Monti]], paid tribute to Levi-Montalcini's "charismatic and tenacious" character and for her lifelong endeavor to "defend the battles in which she believed." Vatican spokesman [[Federico Lombardi]] praised Levi-Montalcini's civil and moral efforts, saying she was an "inspiring" example for Italy and the world.<ref name=nbc3012>{{cite news|last=D'Emilio|first=Frances|title=Nobel-winning biologist Rita Levi-Montalcini dies at 103|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/50324234|access-date=31 December 2012|publisher=NBC News|date=30 December 2012|agency=Associated Press}}</ref>
