According to Russian sources, Tamm had [[German people|German]] noble descent on his father's side through his grandfather Theodor Tamm, who emigrated from [[Thuringia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://elib.biblioatom.ru/text/priroda_1995_07/go,6/|title=К 100-летию Игоря Евгеньевича Тамма: "Природа". – 1995, № 7 – Электронная библиотека "История Росатома"|website=elib.biblioatom.ru}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.peoples.ru/science/physics/tamm/|title=Igor Tamm|last=Chernenko|first=Gennady|date=19 October 2004|encyclopedia=biographical encyclopedia peoples.ru|access-date=7 September 2009}}</ref> Although, his surname "[[Tamm (surname)|Tamm]]" is rather common in [[Estonia]].

He studied at a [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] in [[Elisavetgrad]] (now [[Kropyvnytskyi]], [[Ukraine]]). In 1913–1914 he studied at the [[University of Edinburgh]] together with his school-friend [[Boris Hessen]].

At the outbreak of World War I in 1914 he joined the army as a volunteer field medic. In 1917 he joined the Revolutionary movement and became an active anti-War campaigner, serving on revolutionary committees after the March Revolution.<ref>[http://www.hipersona.ru/nobel-laureates/nl-physics/1463-igor-tamm Игорь Тамм] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308050249/http://www.hipersona.ru/nobel-laureates/nl-physics/1463-igor-tamm |date=8 March 2016 }}. Hipersona.ru. Retrieved on 14 July 2014.</ref>  He returned to the [[Moscow State University]] from which he graduated in 1918.

Tamm married Nataliya Shuyskaya (1894–1980) in September 1917. They eventually had two children, Irina (1921–2009, chemist) and Evgeny (1926–2008, experimental physicist and famous mountain climber, leader of the [[Timeline of climbing Mount Everest|Soviet Everest expedition in 1982]]<ref>[http://www.russianclimb.com/newsarchives50_en.html Mountaineering, climbing. January – February 2008 news]. Russianclimb.com. Retrieved on 14 July 2014.</ref>).

On 1 May 1923, Tamm began teaching physics at the [[Second Moscow State University]]. The same year, he finished his first scientific paper, ''Electrodynamics of the Anisotropic Medium in the Special Theory of Relativity''.<ref>Feinberg, E. L. (1987) ''Reminiscences about I. E. Tamm''. Nauka</ref> In 1928, he spent a few months with [[Paul Ehrenfest]] at the [[Leiden University|University of Leiden]] and made a life-long friendship with [[Paul Dirac]]. <ref>[https://ilorentz.org/history/Dirac/Dirac.html Reminiscence of a boat trip of Tamm and Paul Dirac, April 1928]. ilorentz.org.</ref><ref>[https://cds.cern.ch/record/258359/files/P00020744.pdf Paul Dirac and Igor Tamm Correspondence]. cds.cern.ch.</ref> From  1934 until his death in 1971 Tamm was the head of the theoretical department at [[Lebedev Physical Institute]] in Moscow.

In 1932, Tamm published a paper with his proposal of the concept of [[surface states]]. This concept is important for [[MOSFET]] physics.

In 1934, Tamm and [[Semen Altshuller]] suggested that the neutron has a non-zero magnetic moment,<ref>Tamm, I.E. and Alshuler, S.A. "Magnetic moment of a neutron", ''Reports of the Academy of Science USSR'', 1, 8, 455 (1934) (in Russian)</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/134380b0| title = Nuclear Magnetic Moments and the Properties of the Neutron| journal = Nature| volume = 134| issue = 3384| pages = 380| year = 1934| last1 = Tamm | first1 = I. |bibcode = 1934Natur.134..380T | s2cid = 4049820| doi-access = free}}</ref> the idea was met with scepticism at that time, as the neutron was supposed to be an elementary particle with zero charge, and thus could not have a magnetic moment. The same year, Tamm coined an idea that proton-neutron interactions can be described as an exchange force transmitted by a yet unknown massive particle,<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/133981a0| title = Exchange Forces between Neutrons and Protons, and Fermi's Theory| journal = Nature| volume = 133| issue = 3374| pages = 981| year = 1934| last1 = Tamm | first1 = I.

In 1945 he developed an approximation method for many-body physics.  As [[Sidney Dancoff]] developed it independently in 1950, it is now called the Tamm-Dancoff approximation.

He was the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Laureate in Physics]] for the year 1958 together with [[Pavel Cherenkov]] and [[Ilya Frank]] for the discovery and the interpretation of the [[Cherenkov effect|Cherenkov-Vavilov effect]].

In late 1940s-early 1950s Tamm was involved in the [[Soviet atomic bomb project|Soviet thermonuclear bomb project]], in 1949–1953 he spent most of his time in the "secret city" of [[Sarov]], working as a head of the theoretical group developing the hydrogen bomb,<ref>Sakharov, Andrei (1990) ''Memoirs''. Hutchinson. {{ISBN|0091746361}}</ref> however he retired from the project and returned to the Moscow [[Lebedev Physical Institute]] after the first successful test of a [[hydrogen bomb]] in 1953.

In 1951, together with [[Andrei Sakharov]], Tamm proposed a [[tokamak]] system for the realization of [[controlled thermonuclear fusion|CTF]] on the basis of [[toroid]]al magnetic [[nuclear fusion|thermonuclear reactor]] and soon after the first such devices were built by the <!-- [http://www.kiae.ru/eng/str/inf/oinsi.htm --> INF. Results from the T-3 Soviet magnetic confinement device in 1968, when the [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] parameters unique for that time were obtained, showed temperatures in their machine to be over an order of magnitude higher than what was expected by the rest of the community. The western scientists visited the experiment and verified the high temperatures and confinement, sparking a wave of optimism for the prospects of the tokamak as well as construction of new experiments, which is still the dominant magnetic confinement device today.

In 1964 he was elected a Member of the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leopoldina.org/en/members/list-of-members/member/5291/|title=List of Members|website=www.leopoldina.org|access-date=8 October 2017}}</ref>

Tamm was a student of [[Leonid Isaakovich Mandelshtam]] in science and life.

Tamm was an atheist.<ref>{{cite book|title=About Science, Myself and Others|year=2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780750309929|author=Ginzburg, V. L.|page=253|quote=Nowadays, when we are facing manifestations of religious and. more often, pseudoreligious feelings, it is appropriate to mention that Igor Evgenevich was a convinced and unreserved atheist.}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Physicists: Epoch and Personalities|year=2011|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-9812834164|edition=2|author1=Feinberg, E.

Tamm died in [[Moscow]], [[Soviet Union]], now [[Russia]]. The Lunar crater [[Tamm (crater)|Tamm]] is named after him.
