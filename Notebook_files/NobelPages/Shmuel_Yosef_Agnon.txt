'''Shmuel Yosef Agnon''' ({{lang-he|שמואל יוסף עגנון}}) (July 17, 1888 – February 17, 1970)<ref>Laor, Dan, ''Agnon's Life'', Tel Aviv, Schocken, 1998 [Hebrew]; Falk, Avner, "Agnon and Psychoanalysis," ''Iton'' 77, No. 156, pp. 28–39, 1993 [Hebrew]. Also see Arnold Band, "Shai Agnon by Dan Laor", ''AJS Review'', Vol. 35 (2011), pp. 206—208. Band says that Agnon invented the commonly cited date July 17, 1888 in the 1920s.</ref> was one of the central figures of [[modern Hebrew]] [[fiction]].  In Hebrew, he is known by the [[acronym]] '''Shai Agnon''' ({{Script/Hebrew|ש"י עגנון}}). In English, his works are published under the name '''S. Y. Agnon'''.

Agnon was born in [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Polish Galicia]], then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], and later immigrated to [[Mandatory Palestine]], and died in [[Jerusalem]].

His works deal with the conflict between the traditional [[Jew]]ish life and language and the [[modern world]]. They also attempt to recapture the fading traditions of the European ''[[shtetl]]'' (village). In a wider context, he also contributed to broadening the characteristic conception of the [[narrator]]'s role in literature. Agnon had a distinctive linguistic style mixing modern and rabbinic Hebrew.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|title=Oxford Illustrated Encyclopedia Of The Arts|url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordillustrate00norw|url-access=limited|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1990|isbn=978-0198691372|location=USA|pages=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordillustrate00norw/page/10 10]}}</ref>

==Biography==
[[File:OldBuchachPanorama.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.25|Buczacz, Agnon's hometown]]
Shmuel Yosef Halevi Czaczkes (later Agnon) was born in Buczacz (Polish spelling, pronounced ''Buchach'') or Butschatsch (German spelling), [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Polish Galicia]] (then within the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]), now [[Buchach]], [[Ukraine]]. Officially, his date of birth on the [[Hebrew calendar]] was 18 Av 5648 (July 26), but he always said his birthday was on the Jewish [[Ta'anit|fast day]] of [[Tisha B'Av]], the Ninth of Av.

His father, Shalom Mordechai Halevy, was ordained as a [[rabbi]], but worked in the [[fur trade]], and had many connections among the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]], His mother's side had ties to the [[Misnagdim|Mitnagdim]].

He did not attend school and was schooled by his parents.<ref>[http://www.jajz-ed.org.il/100/people/bios/agnon.html Agnon bio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000915151746/http://www.jajz-ed.org.il/100/people/bios/agnon.html |date=2000-09-15 }}.</ref> In addition to studying Jewish texts, Agnon studied writings of the [[Haskalah]], and was also tutored in German. At the age of eight, he began to write in Hebrew and [[Yiddish]], At the age of 15, he published his first poem – a Yiddish poem about the [[Kabbalah|Kabbalist]] [[Joseph della Reina]]. He continued to write poems and stories in Hebrew and Yiddish, which were published in Galicia.

In 1908, he moved to [[Jaffa]] in [[History of Palestine#Ottoman period|Ottoman Palestine]]. The first story he published there was "[[Agunah|Agunot]]" ("Forsaken Wives"), which appeared that same year in the journal ''Ha`omer.'' He used the [[pen name]] "Agnon," derived from the title of the story, which he adopted as his official [[surname]] in 1924. In 1910, "Forsaken Wives" was translated into German. In 1912, at the urging of [[Yosef Haim Brenner]], he published a novella, "Vehaya Ha'akov Lemishor" ("The Crooked Shall Be Made Straight").

In 1913, Agnon moved to Germany, where he met Esther Marx (1889-1973). They married in 1920 and had two children. In Germany he lived in Berlin and [[Bad Homburg vor der Höhe]] (1921–24). [[Salman Schocken]], a businessman and later also publisher, became his literary [[patron]] and freed him from financial worries. From 1931 on, his work was published by [[Schocken Books]], and his short stories appeared regularly in the newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'', also owned by the Schocken family. In Germany, he continued to write short stories and collaborated with [[Martin Buber]] on an anthology of Hasidic stories. Many of his early books appeared in Buber's ''Jüdischer Verlag'' (Berlin). The mostly assimilated, secular German Jews, Buber and [[Franz Rosenzweig]] among them, considered Agnon to be a legitimate relic, being a religious man, familiar with Jewish scripture. [[Gershom Scholem]] called him "the Jews' Jew".<ref>{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=Hillel|display-authors=et al|title=Agnon and Germany: The Presence of the German World in the Writings of S.Y. Agnon|year=2010|publisher=Bar Ilan University|page=8}}</ref>

In 1924, a fire broke out in his home, destroying his manuscripts and rare book collection. This traumatic event crops up occasionally in his stories. Later that year, Agnon returned to Palestine and settled with his family in the [[Jerusalem]] neighborhood of [[Talpiot]]. In 1929, his library was destroyed again during [[1929 Palestine riots|anti-Jewish riots]].<ref name="Beit Agnon">{{cite web|url=http://www.agnonhouse.org.il/en/About |title=Beit Agnon |publisher=Agnonhouse.org.il |access-date=September 1, 2011}}</ref>

When his novel ''Hachnasat Kalla'' ("The Bridal Canopy") appeared in 1931 to great critical acclaim, Agnon's place in Hebrew literature was assured.<ref>{{cite journal| first=Harold| last=Fisch| title=The Dreaming Narrator in S. Y. Agnon| journal= Novel: A Forum on Fiction| volume= 4| issue=1| date=Autumn 1970| pages=49–68| doi=10.2307/1345251| publisher=Duke University Press| jstor=1345251}}</ref> In 1935, he published ''Sippur Pashut'' ("A Simple Story"), a [[novella]] set in Buchach at the end of the 19th century. Another novel, ''Tmol Shilshom'' ("Only Yesterday"), set in [[Land of Israel|Eretz Yisrael]] (Israel) of the early 20th century, appeared in 1945.

Agnon was a strict [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]] in his personal life.<ref>Schwartz, Richard H. (2001). ''Judaism and Vegetarianism''. pp. 171-172. Lantern Books. {{ISBN|9781930051249}}</ref>

==Literary themes and influences==
[[File:חדר העבודה.JPG|thumb|upright|Agnon's study]]
Agnon's writing has been the subject of extensive [[Research|academic research]]. Many leading scholars of Hebrew literature have published books and papers on his work, among them [[Baruch Kurzweil]], [[Dov Sadan]], [[Nitza Ben-Dov]], [[Dan Miron]], [[Dan Laor]] and [[Alan Mintz]]. Agnon writes about Jewish life, but with his own unique perspective and special touch. In his Nobel acceptance speech, Agnon claimed "Some see in my books the influences of authors whose names, in my ignorance, I have not even heard, while others see the influences of poets whose names I have heard but whose writings I have not read." He went on to detail that his primary influences were the stories of the [[Bible]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1966/agnon-speech.html |title=Nobel Speech |publisher=Nobelprize.org |date=December 10, 1966 |access-date=September 1, 2011}}</ref> Agnon acknowledged that he was also influenced by German literature and culture, and European literature in general, which he read in German translation. A collection of essays on this subject, edited in part by [[Hillel Weiss]], with contributions from Israeli and German scholars, was published in 2010: [http://www.biupress.co.il/website_en/index.asp?id=729 ''Agnon and Germany: The Presence of the German World in the Writings of S.Y. Agnon''.] The budding [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] literature also influenced his works, notably that of his friend, [[Yosef Haim Brenner]]. In Germany, Agnon also spent time with the Hebraists [[Hayim Nahman Bialik]] and [[Ahad Ha'am]].

The communities he passed through in his life are reflected in his works:
* Galicia: in the books [[The Bridal Canopy|''The Bridal Canopy'']], ''A City and the Fullness Thereof'', ''A Simple Story'' and ''A Guest for the Night''.
* Germany: in the stories "Fernheim", "Thus Far" and "Between Two Cities".
* Jaffa: in the stories "Oath of Allegiance", "Tmol Shilshom" and "The Dune".
* Jerusalem: "Tehilla", "Tmol Shilshom", "Ido ve-Inam" and "Shira".

Nitza Ben-Dov writes about Agnon's use of allusiveness, free-association and imaginative dream-sequences, and discusses how seemingly inconsequential events and thoughts determine the lives of his characters.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0XnPnQqebRoC&q=was+agnon+vegetarian |author=Nitza Ben-Dov |title=Agnon's art of indirection: Uncovering latent content in the fiction of S.Y Agnon |access-date=September 1, 2011|isbn=9004098631 |year=1993 }}</ref>

Some of Agnon's works, such as ''The Bridal Canopy'', ''And the Crooked Shall Be Made Straight'', and ''The Doctor's Divorce'', have been adapted for [[theatre]]. A play based on Agnon's letters to his wife, "Esterlein Yakirati", was performed at the [[Jerusalem Khan Theatre|Khan Theater]] in Jerusalem.

==Language==
Agnon's writing often used words and phrases that differed from what would become established modern Hebrew. His distinct language is based on traditional Jewish sources, such as the [[Torah]] and the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], [[Midrash]]ic literature, the [[Mishnah]], and other [[Rabbinic literature]]. Some examples include:

* ''batei yadayim'' (lit. "hand-houses") for modern ''kfafot'' (gloves).
* ''yatzta'' ({{Script/Hebrew|יצתה}}) rather than the modern conjugation ''yatz'a'' ({{Script/Hebrew|יצאה}}) ("she went out").
* ''rotev'' ({{Script/Hebrew|רוטב}}) meaning soup in place of modern ''marak'' ({{Script/Hebrew|מרק}}). In Modern Hebrew the term 'rotev' means 'sauce'.
* ''bet kahava'' for modern ''bet kafe'' (coffee house / café), based on transliteration of the word 'coffe' from Arabic, rather than the contemporary term common in Hebrew which comes from European languages.

[[Bar-Ilan University]] has made a computerized [[concordance (publishing)|concordance]] of his works in order to study his language.

==Awards and critical acclaim==

[[File:פרס נובל קרל לינדול.JPG|thumb|right|Agnon (left), receiving the Nobel Prize, 1966]]
Agnon was twice awarded the [[Bialik Prize]] for literature (1934<ref name=bi01>{{cite web| title = Biography of Shmuel Yosef Agnon| url = http://www.answers.com/topic/shmuel-yosef-agnon}}</ref> and 1950<ref name=bi01/><ref name=bialik>{{cite web|title=List of Bialik Prize recipients 1933–2004 (in Hebrew), Tel Aviv Municipality website |url=http://www.tel-aviv.gov.il/Hebrew/_MultimediaServer/Documents/12516738.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217143811/http://www.tel-aviv.gov.il/Hebrew/_MultimediaServer/Documents/12516738.pdf |archive-date=2007-12-17 }} – which omits the award in 1934</ref>). He was also twice awarded the [[Israel Prize]], for literature (1954<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashyag/Tashkab_Tashyag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashyad |title=Israel Prize recipients in 1954 (in Hebrew) |publisher=Israel Prize Official Site |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307203211/http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashyag/Tashkab_Tashyag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashyad |archive-date=March 7, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and 1958<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashyag/Tashkab_Tashyag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashyah |title=Israel Prize recipients in 1958 (in Hebrew) |publisher=Israel Prize Official Site |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208115723/http://cms.education.gov.il/EducationCMS/Units/PrasIsrael/Tashyag/Tashkab_Tashyag_Rikuz.htm?DictionaryKey=Tashyah |archive-date=February 8, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>).

In 1966, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] "for his profoundly characteristic narrative art with motifs from the life of the Jewish people".<ref name="Literature1966">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1966/index.html|title=Nobel Prize in Literature 1966|publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]|access-date=October 17, 2008}}</ref> The prize was shared with German Jewish author [[Nelly Sachs]]. In his speech at the [[award ceremony]], Agnon introduced himself in Hebrew: "As a result of the historic catastrophe in which [[Titus]] of Rome destroyed Jerusalem and Israel was exiled from its land, I was born in one of the cities of the Exile. But always I regarded myself as one who was born in Jerusalem".<ref>Horst Frenz, ed. ''Nobel Lectures, Literature 1901–1967.'' Amsterdam: Elsevier Publishing Company, 1969. [http://nobelprize.org/literature/laureates/1966/agnon-speech.html Nobel Prize acceptance speech]</ref> The award ceremony took place on a Saturday during the Jewish festival of [[Hanukkah]]. Agnon, who was religiously observant, postponed attendance at the awards ceremony until he had performed two Jewish ceremonies of his own on Saturday night, to end the Sabbath and to light the [[Menorah (Hanukkah)|menorah]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-09-15|title=S.Y. Agnon & the Orthodox Reader|url=https://jewishaction.com/books/reviews/s-y-agnon-orthodox-reader/|access-date=2021-05-03|website=Jewish Action|language=en}}</ref>

In later years, Agnon's fame was such that when he complained to the municipality that traffic noise near his home was disturbing his work, the city closed the street to cars and posted a sign that read: "No entry to all vehicles, writer at work!"<ref>{{cite book|last=Mintz|first=Alan|display-authors=et al|chapter=Introduction|title=A Book That Was Lost|page=29}}</ref>

Agnon died in Jerusalem on February 17, 1970. His daughter, Emuna Yaron, has continued to publish his work [[posthumous work|posthumously]]. Agnon's archive was transferred by the family to the [[Jewish National and University Library|National Library in Jerusalem]]. His home in [[Talpiot]], built in 1931 in the [[Bauhaus]] style, was turned into a museum, ''Beit Agnon.''<ref>{{cite web|title=About section|url=http://www.agnonhouse.org.il/en/About|work=Agnon House Website}}</ref> The study where he wrote many of his works was preserved intact.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/990951.html A little modesty goes a long way]</ref> Agnon's image, with a list of his works and his Nobel Prize acceptance speech, appeared on the [[Israeli new shekel#Banknotes|fifty-shekel bill]], second series, in circulation from 1985 to 2014. The main street in Jerusalem's [[Givat Oranim]] neighborhood is called Sderot Shai Agnon, and a synagogue in Talpiot, a few blocks from his home, is named after him. Agnon is also memorialized in Buchach, now in Ukraine, where he was born. There is an extensive (relative to the size of the museum) exhibition in the Historical Museum in Buchach and, just a few yards away, a bust of Agnon is mounted on a pedestal in a plaza across the street from the house where he lived. The house itself is preserved and marked as the home where Agnon lived from birth till the age of (approximately) 19; the street that runs in front of the house is named "Agnon Street" (in Ukrainian).

Agnotherapy is a method developed in Israel to help elderly people express their feelings.<ref>[http://www.haaretz.com/therapy-through-s-y-agnon-stories-helps-the-elderly-face-their-realities-1.228984 Therapy through S.Y. Agnon stories helps the elderly face their realities]</ref>

==Beit Agnon==
After Agnon's death, the former mayor of Jerusalem [[Mordechai Ish-Shalom]] initiated the opening of his home to the public. In the early 1980s, the kitchen and family dining room were turned into a lecture and conference hall, and literary and cultural evenings were held there. In 2005, the Agnon House Association in Jerusalem renovated the building, which reopened in January 2009. The house was designed by the German-Jewish architect Fritz Korenberg, who was also his neighbor.<ref name="Beit Agnon"/>
