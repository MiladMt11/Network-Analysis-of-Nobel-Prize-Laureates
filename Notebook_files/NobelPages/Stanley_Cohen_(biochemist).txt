'''Stanley N. Cohen''' (November 17, 1922 – February 5, 2020) was an American biochemist who, along with [[Rita Levi-Montalcini]], was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]] in 1986 for the isolation of [[nerve growth factor]] and the discovery of [[epidermal growth factor]]. He died in February 2020 at the age of 97.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eu.tennessean.com/story/news/local/2020/02/05/stanley-cohen-biochemist-nobel-prize-winner-dies/4669415002/|title=Biochemist and Nobel Prize winner Stanley Cohen dies in Nashville at age 97}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/science/stanley-cohen-dead.html|title=Stanley Cohen, Nobelist, Dies at 97; Made Breakthrough on Cell Growth|newspaper=The New York Times|date=7 February 2020|last1=Glaser|first1=Vicki}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Cohen was born in Brooklyn, New York, on November 17, 1922. He was the son of Fannie (née Feitel) and Louis Cohen, a tailor.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/stanley-cohen-woh/|title=Stanley Cohen Biography|website=www.bookrags.com|access-date=6 May 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117070149/http://www.bookrags.com/biography/stanley-cohen-woh/|archive-date=17 November 2017}}</ref><ref name="Sleeman">{{cite book|editor-last1=Sleeman|editor-first1=Elizabeth|title=The international who's who 2004.|date=2003|publisher=Europa|location=London|isbn=978-1857432176|page=339|edition=67th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sR4Ch1dMe8IC&pg=PA339|access-date=4 May 2016}}</ref> His parents were Jewish immigrants.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x6l-DwAAQBAJ&q=%22Feitel+Cohen,+were+Jewish+immigrants;+his+father%22&pg=PT118 |title = Nobel Laureates in Medicine or Physiology: A Biographical Dictionary|isbn = 9780429665035|last1 = Fox|first1 = Daniel M.|last2 = Meldrum|first2 = Marcia|last3 = Rezak|first3 = Ira|date = 2019-01-15}}</ref> Cohen received his [[bachelor's degree]] in 1943 from [[Brooklyn College]], where he had double-majored in [[chemistry]] and [[biology]]. After working as a [[bacteriologist]] at a milk processing plant to earn money, he received his [[Master of Arts]] in [[zoology]] from [[Oberlin College]] in 1945. He earned a [[doctorate]] from the department of biochemistry about the metabolism of earthworms at the  [[University of Michigan]] in 1948.

==Career==
His first academic employment was at the University of Colorado studying the metabolism of premature babies. In 1952 he moved to [[Washington University in St. Louis]], working first in the Department of Radiology, learning isotope methodology, and then in the Department of Zoology. Working with [[Rita Levi-Montalcini]], he isolated nerve growth factor. 
He later isolated a protein that could accelerate incisor eruption and eyelid opening in newborn mice,<ref name="lancet">{{Cite journal |last=Watts |first=Geoff |date=March 2020 |title=Stanley Cohen |journal=The Lancet |language=en |volume=395 |issue=10227 |pages=864 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30550-X|doi-access=free }}</ref> which was renamed epidermal growth factor.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Carpenter | first1 = G. | last2 = Cohen | first2 = S. | author-link2 = Stanley Cohen (biochemist)| doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.48.070179.001205 | title = Epidermal Growth Factor | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 48 | pages = 193–216 | year = 1979 | pmid =  382984}}</ref> He continued research on cellular growth factors after joining the faculty of Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in 1959.

In 1999, Cohen retired from Vanderbilt University.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mc.vanderbilt.edu/reporter/index.html?ID=6020|title=Cohen's visit brings alive wonder, power of science (12/7/07)|website=www.mc.vanderbilt.edu|access-date=2019-11-17}}</ref>

==Awards and legacy==
Cohen received the [[Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize]] from [[Columbia University]] together with Rita Levi-Montalcini in 1983, the [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]] in 1986 for the isolation of [[nerve growth factor]] and the discovery of [[epidermal growth factor]] and the [[National Medal of Science]] in 1986.<ref>{{cite book|last = Cohen|first = Stanley|editor = Tore Frängsmyr |editor2=Jan Lindsten|chapter = Epidermal Growth Factor|chapter-url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1986/cohen-lecture.pdf|title = Nobel Lectures, Physiology or Medicine 1981-1990|publisher = World Scientific Publishing Co|location = Singapore|year = 1993|isbn = 978-981-02-0793-9|url-status = live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101215042021/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1986/cohen-lecture.pdf|archive-date = 2010-12-15}} Cohen's Nobel Lecture.</ref><ref>{{Cite journal
