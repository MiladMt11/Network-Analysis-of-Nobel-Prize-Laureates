==Early life==

Barré-Sinoussi was interested in science from a very young age. During her vacations as a child, she would spend hours analyzing insects and animals, comparing their behaviors and trying to understand why some run faster than others for example. Soon after, Barré-Sinoussi realized she was very talented in the sciences compared to her humanity courses. She expressed interest to her parents that she would like to attend university to study science or become a researcher. Barré-Sinoussi admitted that she was more interested in becoming a doctor but at the time she was under the false impression that studying medicine was both more expensive and lengthier than a career in science. After two years studying at the university, Barré-Sinuossi attempted to find part-time work in a laboratory to ensure that she had made the right career choice. After nearly a year of searching for laboratory work, she was finally accepted by the [[Pasteur Institute]]. Her part-time work at the Pasteur Institute quickly became full-time. She began to only attend university to take the exams and had to rely on her friends’ class notes because she was not regularly attending class. However, Barré-Sinoussi was actually scoring higher on her exams than before because she finally had the motivation because she had realized a career in science was what she wanted to do.<ref name="IAS">{{cite web|title=From discovery to a cure: A conversation with Françoise Barré-Sinoussi|url=https://www.iasociety.org/IASONEVOICE/From-discovery-to-a-cure-A-conversation-with-Francoise-Barre-Sinoussi|website=International AIDS Society|access-date=17 November 2017}}</ref>

==Academic career==

Barré-Sinoussi joined the [[Pasteur Institute]] in Paris in the early 1970s. She received her PhD in 1974 and interned at the U.S. National Institutes of Health before returning to the Pasteur Institute in Montagnier's unit.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Montagnier|first=Luc|date=2002-11-29|title=Historical essay.

During the early AIDS epidemic in 1981-1984, the viral cause of the outbreak had not yet been identified. Working with Luc Montagnier, Jean-Claude Chermann and others at the institute, Barré-Sinoussi isolated and grew a retrovirus from a biopsied swollen lymph node of a patient at risk for AIDS.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barré-Sinoussi|first=F.|last2=Chermann|first2=J.

Barré-Sinoussi started her own laboratory at the Pasteur Institute in 1988. Among Barré-Sinoussi's many recent research contributions are studies of various aspects of the adaptive immune response to viral infection,<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Petitjean |first1=G.L. |last2=Chevalier |first2=M.

Barré-Sinoussi has actively contributed to several scientific societies and committees at the Institut Pasteur as well as to other AIDS organizations, such as the National Agency for AIDS Research in France. She has also been implicated at an international level, notably as a consultant to the [[WHO]] and the [[UNAIDS]]-HIV.

Since the 1980s, Barré-Sinoussi has initiated collaborations with developing countries and has managed multidisciplinary networks with dedication. In 2016, she was interviewed by the [[The Jamaica Observer|Sunday ''Observer'']] and reflected on how Jamaica is dealing with [[HIV]].<ref name="4537b6">{{cite web |url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/editorial/HIV-AIDS--Let-s-beat-the-world-to-a-cure_71605 |title=HIV/AIDS: Let's beat the world to a cure |work=[[The Jamaica Observer]] | access-date = 2016-08-23}}</ref> She constantly works on establishing permanent links between basic research and clinical research with the aim of achieving concrete improvements in the areas of prevention, clinical care, and treatment.<ref>[http://www.witi.com/center/witimuseum/halloffame/2006/fbarre-sinoussi.php WITI Hall of Fame]</ref>

Professor Barré-Sinoussi believes that scientists have made steady progress given the development of antiretroviral treatment which UNAIDS states is being accessed by 17 million of the people globally who are living with AIDS, but finding a cure, or cures, will take time, and a continued investment in research.<ref name="4537b6"/><ref name="d6ad5c">{{cite web |url=https://za.newshub.org/hiv-cure-remains-elusive-despite-handful-remarkable-stories-add-22824245.html |title=HIV cure remains elusive, despite handful of remarkable stories Add to .. |publisher=NewsHub South Africa |access-date=2016-07-23}}</ref> As the Co-chair of the 21st [[International AIDS Society]] (IAS), she said the search for curative strategy of HIV is a goal of paramount importance and a priority for the future of HIV research.

In July 2012 Barré-Sinoussi became President of the International AIDS Society.

===Path to HIV discovery===

When Francoise Barré-Sinoussi began working on [[retroviruses]] at the [[Pasteur Institute]] there were large programs in the United States working on the association between cancer and retroviruses, so she decided to study the link between retroviruses and [[leukemia]] in mice. After the new disease emerged (not yet named AIDS), a group of French physicians came to the Pasteur Institute to ask the rather simple question: is this new disease caused by a retrovirus? After much discussion with other colleagues, including [[Luc Montagnier]], they concluded the agent causing this new disease may be a retrovirus but it was not [[HTLV]], the only known retrovirus at the time, because of differing defining characteristics.  In the early 1980s, Barré-Sinoussi was already familiar with the technique of detecting [[reverse transcriptase]] activity. If reverse transcriptase activity is present, it confirms that the [[virus]] is a retrovirus. In December 1982, heavy research began and clinical observations suggested that the disease attacked immune cells because of the significant CD4 cell depletion. However, the depletion of the CD4 [[lymphocytes]] made it very difficult to isolate the virus in patients with the disease later known as, [[AIDS]]. Because of the difficulty isolating an infected cell from a patient with late disease progression, Barré-Sinoussi and her colleagues decided to use a lymph node [[biopsy]] from a patient with generalized [[lymphadenopathy]]. Generalized lymphadenopathy was a common symptom of patients in the early stages of disease progression. In the second week of checking the biopsied cell cultures for reverse transcriptase activity, enzymatic activity was detected and increased for a short time until the reverse transcriptase activity decreased dramatically after the T-lymphocytes in the culture began to die. Barré-Sinoussi and her colleagues decided to add lymphocytes from a blood donor in order to save the culture and it proved successful after the virus transmitted to the newly added lymphocytes from the blood donor and significant reverse transcriptase activity was again detected. At this point, the virus was named LAV for Lymphadenopathy Associated Virus, which would later be renamed to HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus. 1983 marked the beginning of Barré-Sinoussi's career researching HIV that continued until her retirement. 1983 was also the year it became clear that HIV was not only a target for what was known as the 4Hs, homosexuals, [[hemophiliacs]], Haitians and heroin addicts, but that HIV was also targeting heterosexuals – making the likelihood that the HIV related disease, AIDS, was an epidemic very high.<ref name="IAS"/><ref name="nobel">{{cite web |title=Françoise Barré-Sinoussi – Biographical |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2008/barre-sinoussi-bio.html |website=Nobel Prize |access-date=10 November 2017 }}</ref>

==Leadership==
Francoise Barré-Sinoussi remained at the Pasteur Institute and was appointed head of the Biology of Retroviruses Unit in 1992. The Biology of Retroviruses Unit was reconfirmed in 2005 and renamed the Regulation of Retrovirial Infections Unit. Currently, the unit is working on vaccine research against HIV and the correlates of protection against AIDS for immunotherapy. Barré-Sinoussi's career has also included integration with resource-limited countries, such as [[Vietnam]] and [[Central African Republic]]. Her experiences working in developing nations with the [[World Health Organization]] were truly eye-opening experiences for her and motivated her to continue to collaborate scientifically with various countries through Africa and Asia. This collaboration has promoted many exchanges and workshops between young scientists from resource-limited countries and researches in Paris.<ref name="IAS"/><ref name="nobel"/>

Francoise Barré-Sinoussi was elected to the [[International AIDS Society]] (IAS) Governing Council in 2006 and served as the president of the IAS from 2012 to 2016. Barré-Sinoussi worked on the Conference Advisory Committee for the 9th IAS Conference on HIV Science, which took place in July 2017 and is currently serving as Co-Chair of the IAS, working toward an HIV cure initiative.<ref name="IAS"/><ref name="nobel"/>

== Awards ==
Barré-Sinoussi shared the 2008 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] with Luc Montagnier for their co-discovery of HIV, and with [[Harald zur Hausen]], who discovered the viral cause of cervical cancer that led to the development.

In addition to the Nobel Prize, Barré-Sinoussi has received awards including:
*The Sovac Prize
*The [[Körber European Science Prize]] ({{Abbr|aka|also known as}} Körber Foundation Prize for the Promotion of European Science)
*The Prize of the French Academy of Sciences ({{lang|fr|Académie des sciences}})
