Together with [[Didier Queloz]] in 1995, he discovered [[51 Pegasi b]], the first [[extrasolar planet]] orbiting a sun-like star, [[51 Pegasi]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mayor|first1=Michel|last2=Queloz|first2=Didier|author-link2=Didier Queloz|date=November 1995|title=A Jupiter-mass companion to a solar-type star|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=378|issue=6555|pages=355–59|bibcode=1995Natur.378..355M|doi=10.1038/378355a0|s2cid=4339201}}</ref> For this achievement, they were awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physics "for the discovery of an exoplanet orbiting a solar-type star".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2019/summary/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2019|publisher=[[Nobel Media AB]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191010162437/https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2019/summary/|archive-date=10 October 2019|access-date=8 October 2019}}</ref> Related to the discovery, Mayor noted that humans will never migrate to such exoplanets since they are "much, much too far away ...

Mayor holds MS in [[Physics]] from the [[University of Lausanne]] (1966) and PhD in [[Astronomy]] from the [[Geneva Observatory]] (1971). He was a researcher at the [[Institute of Astronomy, Cambridge|Institute of Astronomy]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1971. Subsequently, he spent [[sabbatical]] semesters at the [[European Southern Observatory]] (ESO) in northern [[Chile]] and at the [[Institute for Astronomy (Hawaii)|Institute for Astronomy]] of the [[University of Hawaii]] system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/connect/our-experts/profiles/michel-mayor.html|title=Michel Mayor|publisher=[[The Planetary Society]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808070521/http://www.planetary.org/connect/our-experts/profiles/michel-mayor.html|archive-date=8 August 2019|access-date=8 August 2019}}</ref>

==Career==
From 1971–84, Mayor worked as a research associate at the [[Observatory of Geneva]], which is home to the astronomy department of the [[University of Geneva]]. He became an associate professor at the university  in 1984.<ref name="Cercle" /> In 1988, the university named him a full professor, a position he held until his retirement in 2007. Mayor was director of the Observatory of Geneva from 1998 to 2004.<ref name="Cercle" /> He is a professor emeritus at the University of Geneva.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetary.org/connect/our-experts/profiles/michel-mayor.html |title=Michel Mayor|publisher=The Planetary Society  |access-date=9 October 2019}}</ref>

==Research==
[[File:Didier Queloz and Michel Mayor at La Silla (6812451755).jpg|thumb|[[Didier Queloz]] and Michel Mayor at the [[La Silla Observatory]] (2012).]]
Mayor's research interests include extrasolar planets (also known as [[exoplanets]]), instrumentation, statistical properties of [[double stars]], [[globular cluster]] dynamics, galactic structure and [[kinematics]]. Mayor's doctoral thesis at the University of Geneva was devoted to the spiral structure of galaxies.<ref name="Cercle" />

During his time as a research associate, there had been strong interest in developing [[Photoelectric effect|photoelectric]]-based [[Doppler spectroscopy|Doppler spectrometers]] to obtain more accurate measurements of [[radial velocity|radial velocities]] of stellar objects compared to existing photographic methods. Following preliminary work by [[Roger Griffin (astronomer)|Roger Griffin]] in 1967 to show the feasibility of photoelectric measurements of radial velocities, Mayor worked with André Baranne at the [[Marseille Observatory]] to develop CORAVEL, a photoelectric spectrometer capable of highly accurate radial velocity measurements, which allow measurement of star movements, orbital periods of [[binary stars]], and even the rotational speed of stars.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Analysis of Starlight: Two Centuries of Astronomical Spectroscopy | first=  John B. | last = Hearnshaw | pages = 114–116 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | year = 2014 | isbn = 978-1107031746 }}</ref>

This research led to various fields of interest, including the study of statistical characteristics of solar-type binary stars. With fellow researcher Antoine Duquennoy, they examined the radial velocities of several systems believed to be binary stars in 1991. Their results found that a subset of these may in fact be single star systems with substellar secondary objects.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Duquennoy|first1=Antoine|last2=Mayor|first2=Michel|date=August 1991|title=Multiplicity among solar-type stars in the solar neighbourhood.

ELODIE was developed with the specific intent to determine if the substellar secondary objects were [[brown dwarf]] stars or potentially giant planets.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Baranne|first1=A.|last2=Queloz|first2=D.|last3=Mayor|first3=M.|last4=Adrianzyk|first4=G.|last5=Knispel|first5=G.|last6=Kohler|first6=D.|last7=Lacroix|first7=D.|last8=Meunier|first8=J.-P.|last9=Rimbaud|first9=G.|last10=Vin|first10=A.|display-authors=1|date=11 October 1996|title=ELODIE: A spectrograph for accurate radial velocity measurements|url=https://aas.aanda.org/articles/aas/pdf/1996/14/ds1106.pdf|url-status=live|journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics Supplement Series|volume=119|issue=2|pages=373–390|bibcode=1996A&AS..119..373B|doi=10.1051/aas:1996251|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809140134/https://aas.aanda.org/articles/aas/pdf/1996/14/ds1106.pdf|archive-date=9 August 2017|access-date=9 October 2019|doi-access=free}}</ref>

By 1994, ELODIE was operational at Geneva and Mayor and Queloz began their survey of Sun-like systems with suspected substellar secondary objects.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/04/180416121621.htm|title=Once upon a time, an exoplanet was discovered|last=Springer|date=16 April 2018|work=[[Science Daily]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402075744/https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/04/180416121621.htm|archive-date=2 April 2019|access-date=9 October 2019}}</ref> In July 1995, the pair's survey of the [[51 Pegasi]] affirmed that there was an [[exoplanet]] orbiting it, identified as [[51 Pegasi b]] which was later classified as a [[Hot Jupiter]]-type planet.

Mayor's work focused more on improving instrumentation for radial velocity measurements to improve detecting exoplanets and measuring their properties. Mayor led a team to further improve ELODIE to increase velocity measurement accuracy to 1&nbsp;m/s via the [[High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher]] (HARPS) installed on the [[ESO 3.6 m Telescope]] at [[La Silla Observatory]] in Chile by 2003.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Queloz|first1=D.|author-link=Didier Queloz|last2=Mayor|first2=M.|display-authors=etal|date=September 2001|title=From CORALIE to HARPS.
