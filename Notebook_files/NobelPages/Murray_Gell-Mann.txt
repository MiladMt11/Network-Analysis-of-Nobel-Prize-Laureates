Gell-Mann] on [[INSPIRE-HEP]]</ref>

==Early life and education==
Gell-Mann was born in lower Manhattan into a family of [[Jews|Jewish]] immigrants from the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], specifically from [[Chernivtsi]] (historical name: Czernowitz) in present-day [[Ukraine]].<ref>{{Cite web |author=M.

Propelled by an intense boyhood curiosity and love for nature and mathematics, he graduated [[valedictorian]] from the [[Columbia Grammar & Preparatory School]] aged 14 and subsequently entered [[Yale College]] as a member of [[Jonathan Edwards College]].<ref name="tnyt" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://je.yalecollege.yale.edu/about-us/history/notable-alumni |title=Notable Alumni |publisher=[[Jonathan Edwards College]] |access-date=27 May 2019}}</ref> At Yale, he participated in the [[William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition]] and was on the team representing [[Yale University]] (along with [[Murray Gerstenhaber]] and [[Henry O. Pollak]]) that won the second prize in 1947.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The William Lowell Putnam Mathematical Competition |author=G. W.

Gell-Mann graduated from Yale with a bachelor's degree in physics in 1948 and intended to pursue graduate studies in physics. He sought to remain in the [[Ivy League]] for his graduate education and applied to [[Princeton University]] as well as [[Harvard University]]. He was rejected by Princeton and accepted by Harvard, but the latter institution was unable to offer him any of the financial assistance that he needed. He was accepted by the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) and received a letter from [[Victor Weisskopf]] urging him to attend MIT and become Weisskopf's research assistant, which would provide Gell-Mann with the financial assistance he needed. Unaware of MIT's eminent status in physics research, Gell-Mann was "miserable" with the fact that he would not be able to attend Princeton or Harvard and considered suicide. He stated that he realized he could try to first enter MIT and commit suicide afterwards if he found it to be truly terrible. However, he couldn't first choose suicide and then attend MIT; the two "didn't commute", as Gell-Mann said.<ref>{{Citation|title=Murray Gell-Mann - MIT or suicide (17/200)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfEvQMPDhOg|language=en|access-date=2020-06-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Strogatz|first=Steven|title=The Joy of x: A Guided Tour of Math, from One to Infinity|publisher=Mariner Books|year=2013|isbn=978-0544105850|pages=27}}</ref>

Gell-Mann received his Ph.D. in physics from MIT in 1951 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled "Coupling strength and nuclear reactions", under the supervision of Victor Weisskopf.<ref>{{Cite thesis|title=Coupling strength and nuclear reactions|url=https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/12195|publisher=Massachusetts Institute of Technology|date=1951|degree=Thesis|first=Murray|last=Gell-Mann|hdl=1721.1/12195}}</ref><ref name="Guardian_obit" /><ref name="mathgene" />

==Career==
Gell-Mann was a postdoctoral fellow at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in 1951,<ref name="tnyt"/> and a visiting research professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] from 1952 to 1953.<ref>in 1954, there, with [[Francis E. Low]], he discovered the [[renormalization group]] equation of QED.</ref> He was a visiting associate professor at [[Columbia University]] and an associate professor at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1954–1955 before moving to the [[California Institute of Technology]], where he taught from 1955 until he retired in 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oralhistories.library.caltech.edu/228/ |title=Interview with Murray Gell-Mann [Oral History] |website=Caltech Institute Archives |access-date=May 25, 2019}}</ref>

===Nuclear physics===
In 1958, Gell-Mann in collaboration with [[Richard Feynman]], in parallel with the independent team of [[E. C. George Sudarshan]] and [[Robert Marshak]], discovered the [[Chirality (physics)|chiral]] structures of the [[weak interaction]] of physics and developed the V-A theory (vector minus axial vector theory).<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Sudarshan|first1=E.

Gell-Mann's work in the 1950s involved recently discovered [[cosmic ray]] particles that came to be called [[kaon]]s and [[hyperon]]s. Classifying these particles led him to propose that a [[quantum number]] called [[strangeness]] would be conserved by the strong and the electromagnetic interactions, but not by the weak interactions.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Gell-Mann |first=M. |title=The Interpretation of the New Particles as Displaced Charge Multiplets |journal=[[Il Nuovo Cimento]] |year=1956 |volume=4 |number=supplement 2 |pages=848–866 |doi=10.1007/BF02748000|bibcode=1956NCim....4S.848G |s2cid=121017243 }}</ref> ([[Kazuhiko Nishijima]] arrived at this idea independently, calling the quantity <math>\eta</math>-charge after the [[eta meson]].<ref>

Murray Gell-Mann's fortunate encounter with mathematician [[Richard Earl Block]] at Caltech, in the fall of 1960, "enlightened" him to introduce a novel classification scheme, in 1961, for [[hadron]]s.<ref>{{cite report |last=Gell-Mann |first=M. |author-link=Murray Gell-Mann |date=March 15, 1961 |title=The Eightfold Way: A Theory of Strong Interaction Symmetry |publisher=California Inst. of Tech., Synchrotron Laboratory |location=[[Pasadena, CA]] |doi=10.2172/4008239 |id=TID-12608 |url=https://www.osti.gov/scitech/servlets/purl/4008239 |via=[[Office of Scientific and Technical Information|OSTI.GOV]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media |title=Murray Gell-Mann - Sheldon Glashow.

In 1964, Gell-Mann and, independently, [[George Zweig]] went on to postulate the existence of [[quark]]s, particles of which the [[hadron]]s of this scheme are composed. The name was coined by Gell-Mann and is a reference to the novel ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', by [[James Joyce]] ("Three quarks for Muster Mark!" book 2, episode 4). Zweig had referred to the particles as "aces",<ref>{{Cite book |author=G. Zweig |orig-year=1964 |chapter=An SU(3) model for strong interaction symmetry and its breaking II |chapter-url=http://cdsweb.cern.ch/search.py?recid=570209&ln=en |editor1=D. Lichtenberg |editor2=S. Rosen |year=1980 |title=Developments in the Quark Theory of Hadrons |volume=1 |pages=22–101 |publisher=Hadronic Press }}</ref> but Gell-Mann's name caught on. Quarks, antiquarks, and gluons were soon established as the underlying elementary objects in the study of the structure of hadrons. He was awarded a [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1969 for his contributions and discoveries concerning the classification of elementary particles and their interactions.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1969/ Simple listing of Nobel Prize in Physics, 1969] Retrieved February 15, 2017</ref>

In the 1960s, he introduced [[current algebra]] as a method of systematically exploiting symmetries to extract predictions from quark models, in the absence of reliable dynamical theory. This method led to model-independent [[Sum rule in quantum mechanics|sum rules]] confirmed by experiment and provided starting points underpinning the development of the [[Standard Model]] (SM), the widely accepted theory of elementary particles.<ref>{{cite conference|last=Ellis |first=John |title=Prospects for New Physics at the LHC |book-title=Proceedings of the Conference in Honour of Murray Gell-Mann's 80th Birthday: Quantum Mechanics, Elementary Particles, Quantum Cosmology and Complexity : Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, February 24–26, 2010 |publisher=World Scientific |year=2011 |isbn=9789814335607 |editor1-last=Fritzsch |editor1-first=Harald |editor2-last=Phua |editor2-first=K.

In 1972 he and [[Harald Fritzsch]] introduced the conserved quantum number "[[color charge]]", and later, together with Heinrich Leutwyler, they coined the term [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD) as the [[gauge theory]] of the strong interaction.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Fritzsch | first1 = H. | last2 = Gell-Mann | first2 = M. | last3 = Leutwyler | first3 = H. | title = Advantages of the color octet gluon picture | journal = Physics Letters | volume = 47B | issue = 4| pages = 365–368 | year = 1973 | doi=10.1016/0370-2693(73)90625-4| bibcode = 1973PhLB...47..365F | citeseerx = 10.1.1.453.4712 }}</ref> The [[quark model]] is a part of QCD, and it has been robust enough to accommodate in a natural fashion the discovery of new "[[Flavour (particle physics)|flavors]]" of quarks, which superseded the eightfold way scheme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/qg-spring2003/eightfold/ |title=The Eightfold Way |last=Baez |first=John C. |author-link=John C.
