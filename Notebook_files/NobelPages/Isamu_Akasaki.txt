==Research==
Akasaki started working on [[GaN]]-based blue LEDs in the late 1960s. Step by step, he improved the quality of GaN crystals and [[Electronic component|device]] structures<ref>Y. Ohki, Y. Toyoda, H. Kobayasi and I. Akasaki: "Fabrication and properties of a practical blue-emitting GaN m-i-s diode. Inst. Phys. Conf. Ser. No. 63, pp. 479-484 (Proc. of the 9th Intl. Symposium on Gallium Arsenide and Related Compounds, 1981).</ref> at Matsushita Research Institute Tokyo, Inc. (MRIT), where he decided to adopt [[metalorganic vapor phase epitaxy]] (MOVPE) as the preferred growth method for GaN.

In 1981 he started afresh the growth of GaN by MOVPE at Nagoya University, and in 1985 he and his group succeeded in growing high-quality GaN on sapphire substrate by pioneering the low-temperature (LT) buffer layer technology.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Amano | first=H. | last2=Sawaki | first2=N. | last3=Akasaki | first3=I. | last4=Toyoda | first4=Y. | title=Metalorganic vapor phase epitaxial growth of a high quality GaN film using an AlN buffer layer | journal=Applied Physics Letters | publisher=AIP Publishing | volume=48 | issue=5 | date=February 3, 1986 | issn=0003-6951 | doi=10.1063/1.96549 | pages=353–355| bibcode=1986ApPhL..48..353A }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last=Akasaki | first=Isamu | last2=Amano | first2=Hiroshi |author-link2=Hiroshi Amano|last3=Koide | first3=Yasuo | last4=Hiramatsu | first4=Kazumasa | last5=Sawaki | first5=Nobuhiko | title=Effects of ain buffer layer on crystallographic structure and on electrical and optical properties of GaN and Ga<sub>1−x</sub>Al<sub>x</sub>N (0 < x ≦ 0.4) films grown on sapphire substrate by MOVPE | journal=Journal of Crystal Growth | publisher=Elsevier BV | volume=98 | issue=1–2 | year=1989 | issn=0022-0248 | doi=10.1016/0022-0248(89)90200-5 | pages=209–219}}</ref>

This high-quality GaN enabled them to discover p-type GaN by doping with [[magnesium]] (Mg) and subsequent activation by electron irradiation (1989), to produce the first GaN p-n junction blue/UV LED (1989), and to achieve conductivity control of n-type GaN (1990)<ref>H.
