'''Otto Stern''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɔto ˈʃtɛʁn|-|De-Otto Stern.ogg}}; 17 February 1888 – 17 August 1969) was a [[German people|German]]-[[Americans|American]] [[physicist]] and [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel laureate in physics]]. He was the second most nominated person for a Nobel Prize with 82 nominations in the years 1925–1945{{cn|date=November 2021}} (most times nominated is [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] with 84 nominations){{cn|date=November 2021}}, ultimately winning in 1943.

==Biography==
[[Image:Stern-plakette.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Plaque on the wall of what are now the physics institutes of Hamburg University, commemorating Stern's tenure]]

Stern was born into a Jewish family in Sohrau (now [[Żory]]) in the [[Province of Silesia]], the [[German Empire]]'s [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. His father was Oskar Stern (1850-1919), a mill owner, who had been living in Breslau (now [[Wrocław]]) since 1892. His mother Eugenia née Rosenthal (1863-1907) was from Rawitsch (now [[Rawicz]]) in the Prussian [[Province of Posen]]. Otto Stern had a brother, Kurt, who became a noted botanist in [[Frankfurt]], and three sisters. He studied in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]], [[Munich]] and Breslau.<ref name="ANB">{{Cite ANB|title=Stern, Otto|author=Charles W. Carey Jr. |id=1301581}}</ref>

Stern completed his studies at the [[University of Breslau]] in 1912 with a doctoral dissertation in physical chemistry<ref name="ANB"/> under supervision of [[Otto Sackur]] on the  kinetic  theory  of  osmotic  pressure  in  concentrated  solutions. He then followed [[Albert Einstein]] to [[Charles University in Prague]] and in 1913 to [[ETH Zurich]]. Stern served in World War I doing meteorological work on the Russian front while still continuing his studies and in 1915 received his [[Habilitation]] at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|University of Frankfurt]]. In 1921 he became a professor at the [[University of Rostock]] which he left in 1923 to become director of the newly founded ''Institut für Physikalische Chemie'' at the [[University of Hamburg]].

After resigning from his post at the [[University of Hamburg]] in 1933 because of the [[Nazism|Nazis]]' [[Machtergreifung]] (seizure of power), he found refuge in the city of [[Pittsburgh]] becoming a professor of [[physics]] at the [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Pittsburgh Strong: Historic Tribute to a Vibrant Jewish Community |url=https://www.bh.org.il/blog-items/pittsburgh-strong-hitsoric-tribute-to-a-vibrant-jewish-community}}</ref> During the 1930s, he was a visiting professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name="nasonline">{{cite web|title=Otto Stern|url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/stern-otto.pdf|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|access-date=16 October 2017}}</ref>

As an experimental physicist Stern contributed to the discovery of [[spin (physics)|spin quantization]] in the [[Stern–Gerlach experiment]] with [[Walther Gerlach]] in February 1922 at the [[Physikalischer Verein]] in [[Frankfurt am Main]];<ref>{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1007/BF01326984|title = Das magnetische Moment des Silberatoms|year = 1922|last1 = Gerlach|first1 = Walther |author1-link=Walther Gerlach|last2 = Stern|first2 = Otto|journal = Zeitschrift für Physik|volume = 9|issue = 1|pages = 353–355|bibcode = 1922ZPhy....9..353G|s2cid = 126109346}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author1=Friedrich, Bretislav |author2=Herschbach Dudley | title=Stern and Gerlach: How a Bad Cigar Helped Reorient Atomic Physics | url=http://www.physicstoday.org/vol-56/iss-12/p53.html | work=Physics Today |date=December 2003 | access-date=7 October 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929091315/http://www.physicstoday.org/vol-56/iss-12/p53.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 29 September 2007}}</ref> demonstration of the wave nature of [[atom]]s and [[molecule]]s; measurement of [[atom]]ic [[magnetic moment]]s; discovery of the [[proton]]'s [[magnetic moment]]; and development of the [[molecular beam]] method which is utilized for the technique of [[molecular beam epitaxy]].

He was awarded the 1943 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], the first to be awarded since 1939. It was awarded to Stern alone, "for his contribution to the development of the molecular ray method and his discovery of the magnetic moment of the proton" (not for the Stern–Gerlach experiment). The 1943 prize was actually awarded in 1944.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1943 |publisher=The Nobel Prize |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1943/summary/}}</ref>

After Stern retired from the Carnegie Institute of Technology, he moved to [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], [[California]]. He was a regular visitor to the Physics colloquium at UC Berkeley. He died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in Berkeley on 17 August 1969.<ref name="nasonline"/>

The [[Stern-Gerlach-Medaille]] of the [[Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft]] awarded for excellence in experimental physics is named after him and Gerlach.

His niece was the crystallographer [[Lieselotte Templeton]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Otto Sterns gesammelte Briefe – Band 1 : Hochschullaufbahn und die Zeit des Nationalsozialismus|others=Schmidt-Böcking, Horst., Templeton, Alan., Trageser, Wolfgang.|date=14 June 2018|isbn=9783662557358|location=Berlin, Heidelberg|oclc=1047864732}}</ref>
