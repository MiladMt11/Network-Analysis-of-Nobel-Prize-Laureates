== Biography ==
Kapitsa was born in [[Kronstadt, Russia|Kronstadt]], [[Russian Empire]], to [[Bessarabia]]n-[[Volhynia]]n-born parents Leonid Petrovich Kapitsa ([[Romanian language|Romanian]] ''Leonid Petrovici Capița''), a [[military engineering-technical university|military engineer]] who constructed fortifications, and Olga Ieronimovna Kapitsa from a [[szlachta|noble Polish]] Stebnicki family.<ref>''[[Tadeusz Gajl]] (2007)''.

Kapitsa's studies were interrupted by the [[First World War]], in which he served as an ambulance driver for two years on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Polish front]].<ref name="James2004">{{cite book |last=James |first=Ioan |author-link=Ioan James |title=Remarkable Physicists: From Galileo to Yukawa |url=https://archive.org/details/remarkablephysic00jame |url-access=limited |year=2004 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-01706-0 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/remarkablephysic00jame/page/n336 320]–327}}</ref> He graduated from the [[Petrograd Polytechnical Institute]] in 1918.  His wife and two children died in the flu epidemic of 1918–19.  He subsequently studied in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], working for over ten years with [[Ernest Rutherford]] in the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], and founding the influential [[Kapitza club]]. He was the first director (1930–34) of the Mond Laboratory in Cambridge.

In the 1920s he originated techniques for creating ultrastrong [[magnetic field]]s by injecting high [[electrical current|current]] for brief periods into specially constructed air-core [[electromagnet]]s. In 1928 he discovered the linear dependence of resistivity on magnetic field strength in various metals for very strong magnetic fields.

In 1934 Kapitsa returned to Russia to visit his parents but the Soviet Union prevented him from travelling back to Great Britain.

As his equipment for high-magnetic field research remained in Cambridge (although later Ernest Rutherford negotiated with the British government the possibility of shipping it to the USSR), he changed the direction of his research to the study of low temperature phenomena, beginning with a critical analysis of the existing methods for achieving low temperatures. In 1934 he developed new and original apparatus (based on the [[adiabatic principle]]) for making significant quantities of [[liquid helium]].

Kapitsa formed the [[Institute for Physical Problems]], in part using equipment which the Soviet government bought from the Mond Laboratory in Cambridge (with the assistance of Rutherford, once it was clear that Kapitsa would not be permitted to return).

In Russia, Kapitsa began a series of experiments to study [[liquid helium]], leading to the discovery in 1937 of its [[superfluidity]] (not to be confused with [[superconductivity]]).  He reported the properties of this new state of matter in a series of papers, for which he was later awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics "for basic inventions and discoveries in the area of low-temperature physics".

In 1939 he developed a new method for liquefaction of air with a low-pressure cycle using a special high-efficiency expansion turbine.  Consequently, during World War II he was assigned to head the Department of Oxygen Industry attached to the [[USSR Council of Ministers]], where he developed his low-pressure expansion techniques for industrial purposes. He invented high power microwave generators (1950–1955) and discovered a new kind of continuous high pressure plasma discharge with electron temperatures over 1,000,000 K.

In November 1945, Kapitsa quarreled with [[Lavrentiy Beria]], head of the [[NKVD]] and in charge of the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]], writing to [[Joseph Stalin]] about Beria's ignorance of physics and his arrogance. Stalin backed Kapitsa, telling Beria he had to cooperate with the scientists. Kapitsa refused to meet Beria: "If you want to speak to me, then come to the Institute." Stalin offered to meet Kapitsa, but this never happened.<ref>[[Simon Sebag Montefiore|Montefiore, Simon Sebag]] (2008) ''Young Stalin'', pp. 446–7. {{ISBN|1400096138}}.</ref>

Immediately after the war, a group of prominent Soviet scientists (including Kapitsa in particular) lobbied the government to create a new technical university, the [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]]. Kapitsa taught there for many years. From 1957, he was also a member of the presidium of the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]] and at his death in 1984 was the only presidium member who was not also a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]].<ref>[[Loren Graham|Graham, Loren R.]] 1994. ''Science in Russia and the Soviet Union: A Short History''. Cambridge University Press. p. 212. {{ISBN|0-521-28789-8}}.</ref>

In 1966, Kapitsa was allowed to visit Cambridge to receive the [[Rutherford Medal and Prize]].<ref>{{cite news | last = Tucker | first = Anthony | title = Dr Peter Kapitza expected in Britain next month | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | pages = 4 | date = 1966-04-04 | url = https://www.newspapers.com/image/259503770/ | access-date = 2019-03-16}}{{subscription required|via=newspapers.com}}</ref> While dining at his old college, [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]], he found he did not have the required [[Academic dress in the United Kingdom#Gown|gown]].

In 1978, Kapitsa won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] "for his basic inventions and discoveries in the area of [[low-temperature physics]]" and was also cited for his long term role as a leader in the development of this area. He shared the prize with [[Arno Allan Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson]], who won for discovering the [[cosmic microwave background]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1978 – Press Release |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1978/press.html |publisher=Nobel Prize.org |date=17 October 1978}}</ref>

''[[Interfacial thermal resistance|Kapitsa resistance]]'' is the thermal resistance (which causes a temperature discontinuity) at the interface between [[liquid helium]] and a solid.
The ''[[Kapitsa–Dirac effect]]'' is a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] effect consisting of the diffraction of electrons by a [[standing wave]] of light. In [[fluid dynamics]], the ''[[Kapitza number]]'' is a dimensionless number characterizing the flow of thin films of fluid down an incline.

== Personal life ==
Kapitsa was married in 1927 to Anna Alekseevna Krylova (1903-1996), daughter of applied mathematician [[Alexei Krylov|A.N. Krylov]]. They had two sons, Sergey and Andrey. [[Sergey Kapitsa]] (1928–2012) was a physicist and demographer. He had the nickname "Centaurus". This arose when once [[Artem Alikhanian]] asked Kapitsas' student Shal'nikov [https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A8%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%8C%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2,_%D0%90%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%81%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%80_%D0%98%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%84%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87] "is your supervisor a human or a beast?" to which Shal'nikov responded that he is a Centaurus i.e. he can be human but also he can get angry and hit you with hooves like a horse.<ref name="Drobantseva_Luria"> Kora Drobantseva's memoirs, "The way we lived"; Академик Ландау: как мы жили: воспоминания Москва 2011 [https://books.google.ru/books/about/%D0%90%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BA_%D0%9B%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%83.html?id=kucVCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=kp_read_button&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false]</ref> Kapitsa was also the host of the popular and long-running Russian scientific TV show ''Evident, but Incredible''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kalinga Prize Laureates |url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/natural-sciences/science-technology/sti-policy/global-focus/science-popularization/science-popularization/kalinga-winners/ |publisher=[[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] |access-date=17 March 2011}}</ref> [[Andrey Kapitsa]] (1931–2011) was a geographer.
