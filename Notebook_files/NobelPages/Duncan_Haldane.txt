==Career and research==
Haldane worked as a physicist at [[Institut Laue–Langevin]] in France between 1977 and 1981. In August 1981, Haldane became an assistant professor of physics at the [[University of Southern California]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://patch.com/new-jersey/princeton/princeton-university-professor-wins-nobel-prize-physics | publisher=Princeton Patch | title=Princeton University Professor Wins Nobel Prize In Physics | date=4 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |  url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/science/nobel-prize-physics-topology.html | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = October 4, 2016 | title = 3 Who Studied Unusual States of Matter Win Nobel Prize in Physics |author1=Dennis Overbye |author2=Sewell Chan}}</ref> where he remained until 1987. Haldane was then appointed as an associate professor of physics in 1981 and later a professor of physics in 1986. In July 1986, Haldane joined the department of physics at [[University of California, San Diego]] as a professor of physics, where he remained until February 1992. In 1990, Haldane was appointed as a professor of physics in the department of physics at Princeton University, where he remains to this day. In 1999, Haldane was named as the Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics.  In 2017, he was named the Sherman Fairchild University Professor of Physics. In the period 2013-2018 Haldane also held a Distinguished Visiting Research Chair<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.perimeterinstitute.ca/news/perimeter-welcomes-new-distinguished-visiting-research-chairs|title=Perimeter Welcomes New Distinguished Visiting Research Chairs | publisher = Perimeter Institute|website=www.perimeterinstitute.ca|access-date= 4 October 2016 | date=22 May 2013}}</ref> at [[Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics]].

Haldane is known for a wide variety of fundamental contributions to [[condensed matter physics]] including the theory of [[Luttinger liquid]]s, the theory of one-dimensional [[Spin model|spin chains]], the theory of [[fractional quantum hall effect]], exclusion statistics, entanglement spectra and much more.<ref name="googlescholar">{{GoogleScholar|GT0JBukAAAAJ}}</ref><ref name="scopus">{{Scopus|6701402909}}</ref>

{{As of|2011}} he is developing a new geometric description of the fractional quantum Hall effect that introduces the "shape" of the "composite boson", described by a "unimodular" (determinant 1) spatial metric-tensor field as the fundamental collective degree of freedom of [[Fractional quantum Hall effect|Fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE)]] states.<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Haldane | first1 = F.

==Awards and honours==
Haldane was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1996|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1996]]<ref name=frs/> and a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (Boston) in 1992;<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amacad.org/multimedia/pdfs/classlist.pdf|title=www.amacad.org}}</ref> a Fellow of the [[American Physical Society]] (1986)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aps.org/programs/honors/fellowships/archive-all.cfm?initial=H&year=1986&unit_id=&institution=|title=www.aps.org}}</ref> and a [[Fellow of the Institute of Physics]] (1996) (UK); a Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (2001).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aaas.org/fellow/haldane-frederick |title=www.aaas.org/fellow/haldane-frederick}}</ref> Haldane was elected as a member of the U.S. [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|title=F.

With David J. Thouless and J. Michael Kosterlitz, Haldane shared the 2016 [[List of Nobel laureates in Physics|Nobel Prize in Physics]]<ref name="nobelnature" /> "for theoretical discoveries of topological phase transitions and topological phases of matter".

==Personal life==
Haldane is a British and Slovenian citizen and United States permanent resident. Haldane and his wife, Odile Belmont, live in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite news|last= Heyboer|first= Kelly |title=Princeton prof celebrates Nobel Prize win by returning to the classroom|url=http://www.nj.com/education/2016/10/princeton_physics_professor_celebrates_nobel_prize.html|access-date=2016-10-09|work=The Star-Ledger|date=4 October 2016}}</ref>
His father was a doctor in the British Army stationed on the Yugoslavia/Austria border and there he met young medicine student Ljudmila Renko, a Slovene, and subsequently married her and moved back to England where Duncan was born.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://siol.net/novice/slovenija/nobelov-nagrajenec-moja-mati-je-bila-zavedna-slovenka-427197 |title = Dober dan.
