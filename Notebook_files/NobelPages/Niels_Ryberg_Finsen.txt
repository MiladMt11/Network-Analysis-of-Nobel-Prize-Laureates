'''Niels Ryberg Finsen''' (15 December 1860 – 24 September 1904) was a [[Danes|Danish]]-[[Faroese people|Faroese]] [[physician]] and [[scientist]]. In 1903, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Medicine and Physiology]] "in recognition of his contribution to the treatment of diseases, especially [[lupus vulgaris]], with concentrated [[light therapy|light radiation]], whereby he has opened a new avenue for medical science."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1903/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1903 |year=2014 |website=Nobelprize.org |publisher=Nobel Media AB |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022202413/http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1903/ |archive-date=2016-10-22 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Biography==
Niels Finsen was born in [[Tórshavn]], [[Faroe Islands]], as the second-oldest of four children. His father was {{Interlanguage link multi|Hannes Finsen|2=da|3=Hannes Finsen (stiftamtmand)|preserve=1}}, who belonged to an Icelandic family with traditions reaching back to the 10th century, and his mother was Johanne Formann from Falster, Denmark.<ref name="nobel">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1903/finsen-bio.html |title=Niels Ryberg Finsen - Biographical |website=Nobelprize.org |publisher=Nobel Media AB |date=2014 |access-date=2016-11-04}}</ref> 

The family moved to [[Tórshavn]] from [[Iceland]] in 1858 when his father was given the position of [[Landfoged]].<ref name="Landfoged">{{cite web |url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Geografi_og_historie/F%C3%A6r%C3%B8erne/landfoged |title=Landfoged |website=Den Store Danske |language=da |year=2012 |access-date=2015-11-05}}</ref> When Niels was four years old his mother died, and his father married her cousin Birgitte Kirstine Formann, with whom he had six children. In 1871 his father was made ''[[prefect|Amtmand]]'' of the [[Faroe Islands]]. His father was a member of the Faroese parliament for 12 years, and his older brother [[:da:Olaf Finsen (apoteker)|Olaf]] similarly became a member of parliament, for five years, as well as the first mayor of the capital, Tórshavn.<ref>[[:da:Olaf Finsen (apoteker)]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2018}}<ref>[[:da:Hannes Finsen (stiftamtmand)]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=January 2018}}
 
Finsen got his early education in [[Tórshavn]], but in 1874 was sent to the Danish [[boarding school]] [[Herlufsholm kostskole|Herlufsholm]], where his older brother Olaf was also a student. Unlike Olaf, Niels had a difficult stay at Herlufsholm, culminating with a statement from the principal which claimed Niels was "a boy of good heart but low skills and energy".<ref name="Rostra">{{cite web|url=http://www.rostra.dk/louis/andreart/Niels_Finsen.html|title=Niels Ryberg Finsen: Danmarks første Nobelpristager |trans-title=Niels Ryberg Finsen: Denmark's first Nobel Prize winner |last=Nielsen |first=Louis |year=2002 |website=Rostras Forlag |language=da |access-date=2015-11-08}}</ref> As a consequence of his low grades and difficulties with the Danish language, he was sent to Iceland in 1876 to enroll in his father's old school, [[Menntaskólinn í Reykjavík|Lærði skólinn]], in Reykjavík.<ref>https://www.rigshospitalet.dk/afdelinger-og-klinikker/finsen/om-finsencentret/Sider/niels-finsen.aspx</ref> By the time he graduated he was 21 years old and finished 11th out of 15th students.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rostra.dk/louis/andreart/Niels_Finsen.html|title = Niels Ryberg Finsen – Danmarks første Nobelpristager}}</ref>

===Studies in medicine===
In 1882, Finsen moved to [[Copenhagen]] to study medicine at the [[University of Copenhagen]], from which he graduated in 1890. Because he had studied in Iceland before moving to Copenhagen to study, he enjoyed privileged admission to [[Regensen]], which is the most prestigious college dormitory in Denmark. Prioritisation of Icelandic and Faroese individuals in the admission process was official Danish government policy that had been put in place in order to integrate the educated elites of its colonies with the university population in Copenhagen.<ref>http://www.regensianersamfundet.dk/medlemsbladet_arkiv/Regensen/1992/Regensen_1992.pdf</ref> Following graduation, he became a [[prosector]] of [[anatomy]] at the university. After three years, he quit the post to devote himself fully to his scientific studies. In 1898 Finsen was given a [[professorship]] and in 1899 he became a [[Order of the Dannebrog|Knight of the Order of Dannebrog]].

The {{Interlanguage link multi|Finsen Institute|2=da|3=Finseninstituttet|preserve=1}} was founded in 1896, with Finsen serving as its first director. It was later merged into [[Rigshospitalet|Copenhagen University Hospital]] and currently serves as a cancer research laboratory that specializes in [[proteolysis]].

Finsen suffered from [[Niemann–Pick disease]], which inspired him to sunbathe and investigate the effects of light on living things.<ref name="nobel"/> As a result, Finsen is best known for his theory of [[phototherapy]], in which certain wavelengths of light can have beneficial medical effects.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/230628338 |format=PDF |last1=Grzybowski |first1=Andrzej |last2=Pietrzak |first2=Krzysztof |year=2012 |title=From patient to discoverer-Niels Ryberg Finsen (1860-1904)-the founder of phototherapy in dermatology |journal=Clinics in Dermatology |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=451–455 |pmid=22855977 |doi=10.1016/j.clindermatol.2011.11.019}}</ref> His most notable writings were ''Finsen Om Lysets Indvirkninger paa Huden'' ("On the effects of light on the skin"), published in 1893 and ''Om Anvendelse i Medicinen af koncentrerede kemiske Lysstraaler'' ("The use of concentrated chemical light rays in medicine"), published in 1896. The papers were rapidly translated and published in both German and French. In his late work he researched the effects of [[sodium chloride]], observing the results of a low sodium diet, which he published in 1904 as ''En Ophobning af Salt i Organismen'' ("An accumulation of salt in the organism").<ref name = "nobel"/>

Finsen won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology]] in 1903 for his work on phototherapy. He was the first [[Scandinavia]]n to win the prize and is the only [[Faroe Islands|Faroese]] Nobel Laureate to date. In 1904, Finsen was awarded the [[Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh]].

===Personal life===
Finsen married Ingeborg Balslev (1868–1963) on 29 December 1892.

Finsen's health began to fail in the mid-1880s. He had symptoms of heart trouble and suffered from [[ascites]] and general weakness. The sickness disabled his body but not his mind, and he continued to work from his wheelchair. He died in Copenhagen on 24 September 1904. Accounts of his funeral can be found at the National Library of Medicine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oculus.nlm.nih.gov/finsen095|title=Memoir of Funeral of Niels Ryberg Finsen, and Clippings 1904|publisher=National Library of Medicine}}</ref>

==Memorials==
The [[Finsen Laboratory]] at [[Copenhagen University Hospital]] is named in his honor. [[Finsensvej]] in [[Frederiksberg]] is also named in his honor and so was the Finsen Power Station, which was located on its north side.

A large memorial to Finsen designed by [[Rudolph Tegner]]
was installed next to [[Rigshospitalet]] in [[Copenhagen]] in 1909. It shows a standing naked man flanked by two kneeling naked women reaching up to the sky. The sculpture is entitled ''Mod lyset'' (Towards the Light), and symbolised Finsen's principal scientific theory that sunlight can have healing properties. It is situated on the corner of [[Blegdamsvej]] and [[Nørre Allé]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kk.sites.itera.dk/apps/kk_monumenter/index_ny.asp?lang=dk&mode=detalje&id=22 |title=Mod Lyset |trans-title=Towards the Light |website=Copenhagen Municipality |language=da |access-date=2013-09-17}}</ref>

In [[Tórshavn]] there is also a memorial to Finsen and one of the city's main streets, [[Niels Finsens gøta]], bears his name. [[Kommunuskúlin]], the old public school in central Tórshavn is rebuilt for student housing with the new name Finsen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kvf.fo/netvarp/sv/2018/01/12/20180112storurinnflytingardagurifinsen|title = Tey fyrstu eru flutt í Finsen}}</ref>
