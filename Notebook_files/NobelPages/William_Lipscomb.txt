==Biography==

===Overview===

Lipscomb was born in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]. His family moved to [[Lexington, Kentucky]] in 1920,<ref name="Nobel">{{Nobelprize|accessdate=2020-05-30}}</ref> and he lived there until he received his [[Bachelor of Science]] [[academic degree|degree]] in Chemistry at the [[University of Kentucky]] in 1941. He went on to earn his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree in Chemistry from the [[California Institute of Technology|California Institute of Technology (Caltech)]] in 1946. 

From 1946 to 1959 he taught at the [[University of Minnesota]]. From 1959 to 1990 he was a professor of [[chemistry]] at [[Harvard University]], where he was a [[professor emeritus]] since 1990.

Lipscomb was married to the former Mary Adele Sargent from 1944 to 1983.<ref>{{cite web|author=LorraineGilmer02 &nbsp;(View posts) |url=http://boards.ancestry.com/surnames.sargent/1429/mb.ashx |title=obit fyi – Mary Adele Sargent Lipscomb, 1923 Ca. – 2007 NC – Sargent – Family History & Genealogy Message Board – Ancestry.com |publisher=Boards.ancestry.com |date=2007-09-27 |access-date=2012-02-01}}</ref> They had three children, one of whom lived only a few hours.

===Early years===

"My early home environment ... stressed personal responsibility and self reliance. Independence was encouraged especially in the early years when my mother taught music and when my father's medical practice occupied most of his time."

In grade school Lipscomb collected animals, insects, pets, rocks, and minerals.

Interest in astronomy led him to visitor nights at the Observatory of the University of Kentucky, where Prof. H. H. Downing gave him a copy of Baker's ''Astronomy.''
Lipscomb credits gaining many intuitive physics concepts from this book and from his conversations with Downing, who became Lipscomb's lifelong friend.

The young Lipscomb participated in other projects, such as [[morse code|Morse-coded]] messages over wires and [[crystal radio]] sets, with five nearby friends who became physicists, physicians, and an engineer.

At age of 12,  Lipscomb was given a small Gilbert [[chemistry set]]. He expanded it by ordering apparatus and chemicals from suppliers and by using his father's privilege as a physician to purchase chemicals at the local drugstore at a discount. Lipscomb made his own fireworks and entertained visitors with color changes, odors, and explosions. His mother questioned his home chemistry hobby only once, when he attempted to isolate a large amount of [[urea]] from [[urine]].

Lipscomb credits perusing the large medical texts in his physician father's library and the influence of [[Linus Pauling]] years later to his undertaking biochemical studies in his later years.  Had Lipscomb become a physician like his father, he would have been the fourth physician in a row along the Lipscomb male line.

===Education===

Lipscomb's high-school chemistry teacher, Frederick Jones, gave Lipscomb his college books on [[organic chemistry|organic]], [[analytical chemistry|analytical]], and [[general chemistry]], and asked only that Lipscomb take the examinations.
During the class lectures, Lipscomb in the back of the classroom did research that he thought was original (but he later found was not): the preparation of [[hydrogen]] from [[sodium formate]] (or [[sodium oxalate]]) and [[sodium hydroxide]].<ref name="HS_Science_Research">{{cite web|url=http://wlipscomb.tripod.com/publications_pubs_high-school.html |title=HighSchool – Publications – Lipscomb |publisher=Wlipscomb.tripod.com |date=1937-02-25 |access-date=2012-02-01}}</ref>
He took care to include gas analyses and to search for probable [[side reaction]]s.

Lipscomb later had a high-school physics course and took first prize in the state contest on that subject.  He also became very interested in [[special relativity]].

In college at the University of Kentucky Lipscomb had a music scholarship.
He pursued  independent study there, reading Dushman' s ''Elements of Quantum Mechanics'', the [[University of Pittsburgh]] Physics Staff's ''An Outline of Atomic Physics'', and Pauling's ''The Nature of the Chemical Bond and the Structure of Molecules and Crystals.''
Prof. Robert H. Baker suggested that Lipscomb research the direct preparation of derivatives of [[alcohol]]s from dilute [[aqueous solution]] without first separating the alcohol and water, which led to Lipscomb's first publication.<ref name=Lipscomb1942Alcohols/>

For graduate school Lipscomb chose Caltech, which offered him a teaching assistantship in Physics at $20/month.  He turned down more money from [[Northwestern University]], which offered  a research assistantship at $150/month.   [[Columbia University]] rejected Lipscomb's application in a letter written by Nobel prizewinner Prof. [[Harold Urey]].

At Caltech Lipscomb intended to study theoretical [[quantum mechanics]] with Prof. [[William Vermillion Houston|W. V. Houston]] in the Physics Department, but after one semester switched to the Chemistry Department under the
influence of Prof. Linus Pauling.  World War II work divided Lipscomb's time in graduate school beyond his other thesis work, as he partly analyzed smoke particle size, but mostly worked with [[nitroglycerin]]–[[nitrocellulose]] propellants, which involved handling vials of pure nitroglycerin on many occasions.
Brief audio clips by Lipscomb about his war work may be found from the [[#External links|External Links]] section at the bottom of this page, past the References.

The source for this subsection, except as noted, is Lipscomb's autobiographical sketch.<ref name=InHonorOfWnlStructuresAndMechanisms2002/>

===Later years===

The Colonel is how Lipscomb's students referred to him, directly addressing him as Colonel.  "His first doctoral student, Murray Vernon King, pinned the label on him, and it was quickly adopted by other students, who wanted to use an appellation that showed informal respect.  ... Lipscomb's Kentucky origins as the rationale for the designation."<ref name=Katz2000/>
Some years later in 1973 Lipscomb was made a member of the [[Kentucky colonel|Honorable Order of Kentucky Colonels]].<ref name=Hargittai2003/>

Lipscomb, along with several other Nobel laureates, was a regular presenter at the annual [[Ig Nobel Prize|Ig Nobel]] Awards Ceremony, last doing so on September 30, 2010.<ref>http://improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume17/v17i4/v17i4.html</ref><ref>http://improbable.com/ig/2010/#webcastinfo</ref>

==Scientific studies==

Lipscomb worked in three main areas, nuclear magnetic resonance and the chemical shift, boron chemistry and the nature of the chemical bond, and large biochemical molecules.  These areas overlap in time and share some scientific techniques.
In at least the first two of these areas Lipscomb gave himself a big challenge likely to fail,
and then plotted a course of intermediate goals.

===Nuclear magnetic resonance and the chemical shift===
[[File:Lipscomb-NMR-hexaborene-B6H10.png|thumb|right|NMR spectrum of hexaborane B<sub>6</sub>H<sub>10</sub> showing the interpretation of a spectrum to deduce the molecular structure. (click to read details)]]

In this area Lipscomb proposed that:
"... progress in structure determination, for new polyborane species and for substituted [[borane]]s and [[carborane]]s, would be greatly accelerated if the [boron-11] [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] spectra, rather than [[X-ray diffraction]], could be used."<ref name=Lipscomb1977/>
This goal was partially achieved, although X-ray diffraction is still necessary to determine many such atomic structures. The diagram at right shows a typical nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrum of a borane molecule.

Lipscomb investigated, "... the carboranes, C<sub>2</sub>B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>12</sub>, and the sites of electrophilic attack on these compounds<ref name=Potenza1966Electrophilic/> using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. This work led to [Lipscomb's publication of a comprehensive] theory of chemical shifts.<ref name=Lipscomb1966Shift/> The calculations provided the first accurate values for the constants that describe the behavior of several types of molecules in magnetic or electric fields."<ref name=HutchinsonDictionary2011/>

Much of this work is summarized in a book by Gareth Eaton and William Lipscomb, ''NMR Studies of Boron Hydrides and Related Compounds'',<ref name=Eaton1969/> one of Lipscomb's two books.

===Boron chemistry and the nature of the chemical bond===

In this area Lipscomb originally intended a more ambitious project: "My original intention in the late 1940s was to spend a few years understanding the [[borane]]s, and then to discover a systematic [[Valence (chemistry)|valence]] description of the vast numbers of electron deficient [[intermetallics|intermetallic]] compounds. I have made little progress toward this latter objective. Instead, the field of [[boron]] chemistry has grown enormously, and a systematic understanding of some of its complexities has now begun."<ref name=Lipscomb1977PrixNobel/>
Examples of these intermetallic compounds are KHg<sub>13</sub> and Cu<sub>5</sub>Zn<sub>7</sub>.  Of perhaps 24,000 of such compounds the structures of only 4,000 are known (in 2005) and we cannot predict structures for the others, because we do not sufficiently understand the nature of the chemical bond.
This study was not successful, in part because the calculation time required for intermetallic compounds was out of reach in the 1960s, but intermediate goals involving boron bonding were achieved, sufficient to be awarded a Nobel Prize.

[[File:lipscomb diborane b2h6 atomic diagram.png|thumb|right|Atomic diagram of [[diborane]] (B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>).]]
[[File:Diborane 02.svg|thumb|right|Bonding diagram of [[diborane]] (B<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub>) showing with curved lines a pair of [[three-center two-electron bond]]s, each of which consists of a pair of electrons bonding three atoms, two boron atoms and a hydrogen atom in the middle.]]

The three-center two-electron bond is illustrated in [[diborane]] (diagrams at right).
In an ordinary covalent bond a pair of electrons bonds two atoms together, one at either end of the bond, the diboare B-H bonds for example at the left and right in the illustrations.
In three-center two-electron bond a pair of electrons bonds three atoms (a boron atom at either end and a hydrogen atom in the middle), the diborane B-H-B bonds for example at the top and bottom of the illustrations.

Lipscomb's group did not propose or discover the three-center two-electron bond,
nor did they develop formulas that give the proposed mechanism.
In 1943, [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|Longuet-Higgins]], while still an undergraduate at Oxford, was the first to explain
the structure and bonding of the boron hydrides. The paper reporting the work, written with his tutor R. P. Bell,
<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Longuet-Higgins | first1 = H. C. | last2 = Bell            | first2 = R. P. | author-link = H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins | title   = 64.

<ref name=Dilthey1921/> Shortly after, in 1947 and 1948, experimental spectroscopic work was performed by Price<ref name=Price1947/><ref name=Price1948/>
that confirmed Longuet-Higgins' structure for diborane. The structure was re-confirmed by electron diffraction measurement in 1951 by K. Hedberg and V. Schomaker, with the confirmation of the structure shown in the schemes on this page.<ref>{{ cite journal |author1=Hedberg, K. |author2=Schomaker, V. | title = A Reinvestigation of the Structures of Diborane and Ethane by Electron Diffraction | journal = [[Journal of the American Chemical Society]] | year = 1951 | volume = 73 | issue = 4 | pages = 1482–1487 | doi = 10.1021/ja01148a022 }}</ref> Lipscomb and his graduate students further determined the [[molecular structure]] of [[borane]]s (compounds of boron and hydrogen) using [[X-ray crystallography]] in the 1950s and developed theories to explain their [[chemical bond|bond]]s. Later he applied the same methods to related problems, including the structure of [[carborane]]s (compounds of carbon, boron, and hydrogen). [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|Longuet-Higgins]]
and Roberts<ref name=Longuet-Higgins1954/><ref name=Longuet-Higgins1955/>
discussed the electronic structure of an icosahedron of boron atoms and of the borides MB<sub>6</sub>. The mechanism of the three-center two-electron bond was also discussed in a later paper by Longuet-Higgins,<ref>{{cite journal | author1 = H. C. Longuet-Higgins | title = title unknown | journal =  J. Roy. Inst. Chem.| year = 1953 | volume = 77 | page = 197}}</ref> and an essentially equivalent mechanism was proposed by Eberhardt, Crawford, and Lipscomb.<ref name=Eberhardt1954ThreeCenter/>
Lipscomb's group also achieved an understanding of it through electron orbital calculations using formulas by Edmiston and Ruedenberg and by Boys.<ref name=Kleir1974Rudenberg/>

The Eberhardt, Crawford, and Lipscomb paper<ref name=Eberhardt1954ThreeCenter/> discussed above  also devised the "styx number" method to catalog certain kinds of boron-hydride bonding configurations.

[[File:lipscomb diamond-square-diamond-horizontal.png|thumb|left|Diamond-square-diamond (DSD) rearrangement. At each vertex is a boron atom and (not shown) a hydrogen atom. A bond joining two triangular faces breaks to form a square, and then a new bond forms across opposite vertices of the square.]]

Wandering atoms was a puzzle solved by Lipscomb<ref name=Lipscomb1966DSD/> in one of his few papers with no co-authors.
Compounds of boron and hydrogen tend to form closed cage structures.
Sometimes the atoms at the vertices of these cages move substantial distances with respect to each other.
The diamond-square-diamond mechanism (diagram at left) was suggested by Lipscomb to explain this rearrangement of vertices.
Following along in the diagram at left for example in the faces shaded in blue,
a pair of triangular faces has a left-right diamond shape.
First, the bond common to these adjacent triangles breaks, forming a square,
and then the square collapses back to an up-down diamond shape
by bonding the atoms that were not bonded before.
Other researchers have discovered more about these rearrangements.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Hutton|first=Brian W. |author2=MacIntosh, Fraser |author3=Ellis, David |author4=Herisse, Fabien |author5=Macgregor, Stuart A. |author6=McKay, David |author7=Petrie-Armstrong, Victoria |author8=Rosair, Georgina M. |author9=Perekalin, Dmitry S. |author10=Tricas, Hugo |author11=Welch, Alan J. |title=Unprecedented steric deformation of ortho-carborane|journal=Chemical Communications |date=2008|issue=42|pages=5345–5347|doi=10.1039/B810702E|pmid=18985205 |url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2008/CC/b810702e}}</ref>

[[File:Lipscomb b10-h16-horizontal.png|thumb|right|B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub> showing in the middle a bond directly between two boron atoms without terminal hydrogens, a feature not previously seen in other boron hydrides.]]

The B<sub>10</sub>H<sub>16</sub> structure (diagram at right) determined by Grimes, Wang, Lewin, and Lipscomb found a bond directly between two boron atoms without terminal hydrogens, a feature not previously seen in other boron hydrides.<ref name=Grimes1961/>

Lipscomb's group developed calculation methods, both empirical<ref name=Eaton1969/> and from quantum mechanical theory.<ref name=Pitzer1962/><ref name=Stevens1963/>
Calculations by these methods produced accurate [[Hartree–Fock method|Hartree–Fock self-consistent field (SCF)]] [[molecular orbital]]s and were used to study boranes and carboranes.

[[File:Lilpscomb-ethane-barrier.png|thumb|left|Ethane barrier to rotation about the carbon-carbon bond, first accurately calculated by Pitzer and Lipscomb.]]

The [[ethane]] barrier to rotation (diagram at left) was first calculated accurately by [[Russell M. Pitzer|Pitzer]] and Lipscomb<ref name=Pitzer1963Ethane/> using the [[Hartree–Fock method|Hartree–Fock (SCF)]] method.

Lipscomb's calculations continued to a detailed examination of partial bonding through "... theoretical studies of multicentered chemical bonds including both delocalized and [[localized molecular orbitals]]."<ref name=Lipscomb1977/>
This included "... proposed molecular orbital descriptions in which the bonding electrons are delocalized over the whole molecule."<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite journal | doi = 10.1036/1097-8542.109100| title = Carborane |journal=AccessScience |last=Getman |first=Thomas D. |year=2014}}</ref>

<ref name=Hoffmann1962LCAO/>
<ref name=Hoffmann1962Sequential/>
<ref name=Hoffmann1963Carboranes/>

Under Lipscomb's direction the [[Extended Hückel method]] of molecular orbital calculation was developed by Lawrence Lohr<ref name=Lipscomb1977PrixNobel/> and by Roald Hoffmann.<ref name=Hoffmann1962TheoryI/><ref name=Lipscomb1963/>  This method was later extended by Hoffman.<ref name=Hoffmann1963/>
In Lipscomb's laboratory this method was reconciled with [[Hartree–Fock method|self-consistent field (SCF)]] theory by Newton<ref name=Newton1966/> and by Boer.<ref name=Boer1966/>

Noted boron chemist [[M. Frederick Hawthorne]] conducted early<ref name=LipscombHawthorne1959/><ref name=PitochelliHawthorne1962/> and continuing<ref name=LipscombHawthorne1972/><ref name=PaxtonHawthorne1974/> research with Lipscomb.

Much of this work is summarized in a book by Lipscomb, ''Boron Hydrides'',<ref name=Lipscomb1963/> one of Lipscomb's two books.

The 1976 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] was awarded to Lipscomb "for his studies on the structure of boranes illuminating problems of chemical bonding".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1976/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1976 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |access-date=2012-02-01}}</ref>
In a way this continued work on the nature of the chemical bond by his doctoral advisor at the California Institute of Technology, [[Linus Pauling]], who was awarded the 1954 Nobel Prize in Chemistry "for his research into the nature of the chemical bond and its application to the elucidation of the structure of complex substances."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1954/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1954 |publisher=Nobelprize.org |access-date=2012-02-01}}</ref>

===Large biological molecule structure and function===

Lipscomb's later research focused on the atomic structure of [[protein]]s, particularly how [[enzymes]] work.
His group used x-ray diffraction to solve the three-dimensional structure of these proteins to atomic resolution, and then to analyze the atomic detail of how the molecules work.

The images below are of Lipscomb's structures from the Protein Data Bank<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcsb.org/ |title=rcsb.org |publisher=rcsb.org |access-date=2012-02-01}}</ref> displayed in simplified form with atomic detail suppressed.  Proteins are chains of amino acids, and the continuous ribbon shows the trace of the chain with, for example, several amino acids for each turn of a helix.

[[File:Carboxypeptidase-a-pdb-5CPA.png|thumb|upright|left|alt=carboxypeptidase A|[[carboxypeptidase A]]]]

[[Carboxypeptidase A]]<ref name=Lipscomb1968CPA/> (left) was the first protein structure from Lipscomb's group.  Carboxypeptidase A is a digestive enzyme, a protein that digests other proteins.  It is made in the pancreas and transported in inactive form to the intestines where it is activated.  Carboxypeptidase A digests by chopping off certain amino acids one-by-one from one end of a protein.
The size of this structure was ambitious.  Carboxypeptidase A was a much larger molecule than anything solved previously.

[[File:Apartate-carbamoyltransferase-pdb-2ATC.png|thumb|upright|right|alt=apartate carbamoyltransferase|[[aspartate carbamoyltransferase]]]]

[[Aspartate carbamoyltransferase]].<ref name=Honzatko1983atcase/>  (right) was the second protein structure from Lipscomb's group.
For a copy of [[DNA]] to be made, a duplicate set of its [[nucleotide]]s is required. Aspartate carbamoyltransferase performs a step in building the [[pyrimidine]] nucleotides ([[cytosine]] and [[thymidine]]).  Aspartate carbamoyltransferase also ensures that just the right amount of pyrimidine nucleotides is available, as activator and inhibitor molecules attach to aspartate carbamoyltransferase to speed it up and to slow it down.
Aspartate carbamoyltransferase is a complex of twelve molecules.
Six large catalytic molecules in the interior do the work, and six small regulatory molecules on the outside control how fast the catalytic units work.
The size of this structure was ambitious.  Aspartate carbamoyltransferase was a much larger molecule than anything solved previously.

and its inhibitor MB06322 (CS-917)<ref name=Erion2005Dibetes/>
were studied by Lipscomb's group in a collaboration, which included Metabasis Therapeutics, Inc., acquired by [[Ligand Pharmaceuticals]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ligand.com/ |title=ligand.com |publisher=ligand.com |access-date=2012-02-01}}</ref> in 2010, exploring the possibility of finding a treatment for [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]], as the MB06322 inhibitor slows the production of sugar by fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase.

Steitz was awarded the 2009 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for determining the even larger structure of the large [[50S]] ribosomal subunit, leading to an understanding of possible medical treatments.

Subsequent [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel Prize]] winner [[Ada Yonath]], who shared the 2009 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with [[Thomas A. Steitz]] and [[Venkatraman Ramakrishnan]], spent some time in Lipscomb's lab where both she and Steitz were inspired to pursue later their own very large structures.<ref name=CEN_Nov_2009/>  This was while she was a postdoctoral student at MIT in 1970.

[[File:Lipscombite sample.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lipscombite]]: Mineral, small green crystals on quartz, [[Harvard Museum of Natural History]], gift of W. N. Lipscomb Jr., 1996]]

The mineral [[lipscombite]] (picture at right) was named after Professor Lipscomb by the mineralogist John Gruner who first made it artificially.

Low-temperature x-ray diffraction was pioneered in Lipscomb's laboratory<ref name=Abrahams1950/><ref name=King1950LowTemperature/><ref name=Milberg1951LowTemperature/> at about the same time as parallel work in [[Isadore Fankuchen]]'s laboratory<ref name=Kaufman1949/> at the then [[Polytechnic Institute of New York University|Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn]].
Lipscomb began by studying compounds of nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, and other substances that are solid only below liquid nitrogen temperatures, but other advantages eventually made low-temperatures a normal procedure.
Keeping the crystal cold during data collection produces a less-blurry 3-D electron-density map because the atoms have less thermal motion.  Crystals may yield good data in the x-ray beam longer because x-ray damage may be reduced during data collection and because the solvent may evaporate more slowly, which for example may be important for large biochemical molecules whose crystals often have a high percentage of water.

Other important compounds were studied by Lipscomb and his students.
Among these are
[[hydrazine]],<ref name=Collin1951Hydrazine/>
[[nitric oxide]],<ref name=Dulmage1951Nitric/>
[[metal dithiolene complex|metal-dithiolene complexes]],<ref name=Enemark1965MetalDi/>
methyl ethylene phosphate,<ref name=Steitz1965MEPhosphate/>
mercury [[amide]]s,<ref name=Lipscomb1957Mercury/>

crystalline [[hydrogen fluoride]],<ref name=Atoji1954HF/>
[[Roussin's black salt]],<ref name=Johansson1958Roussin/>
(PCF<sub>3</sub>)<sub>5</sub>,<ref name=Spencer1961PCF/>
complexes of [[Cyclooctatetraene|cyclo-octatetraene]] with [[(Benzylideneacetone)iron tricarbonyl|iron tricarbonyl]],<ref name=Dickens1962Octatetraene/>
and [[Vincristine|leurocristine (Vincristine)]],<ref name=Moncrief1965Vincristine/> which is used in several cancer therapies.
