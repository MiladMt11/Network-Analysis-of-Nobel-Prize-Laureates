The transistor revolutionized the electronics industry, making possible the development of almost every modern electronic device, from [[telephone]]s to [[computer]]s, and ushering in the [[Information Age]]. Bardeen's developments in superconductivity—for which he was awarded his second Nobel Prize—are used in [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] spectroscopy (NMR) and medical [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI).

Born and raised in [[Wisconsin]], Bardeen received a PhD in physics from [[Princeton University]].  After serving in [[World War II]], he was a researcher at [[Bell Labs]], and a professor at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign|University of Illinois]]. In 1990, Bardeen appeared on ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine's list of "100 Most Influential Americans of the Century."<ref name="washpost">{{cite news |title= John Bardeen, Nobelist, Inventor of Transistor, Dies |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1047095.html|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121102062647/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1047095.html|url-status= dead|archive-date= November 2, 2012|newspaper=Washington Post|date=January 31, 1991 |access-date=August 3, 2007 }}</ref>

==Education and early life==
Bardeen was born in [[Madison, Wisconsin]], on May 23, 1908.<ref name="Biography of John Bardeen">{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1956/bardeen-bio.html |title=Biography of John Bardeen |access-date=November 1, 2007 |publisher=The Nobel Foundation }}</ref> He was the son of [[Charles Russell Bardeen|Charles Bardeen]], the first dean of the University of Wisconsin Medical School.

Bardeen attended the University High School at Madison. He graduated from the school in 1923 at age 15.<ref name="Biography of John Bardeen"/> He could have graduated several years earlier, but this was postponed because he took courses at another high school and  because of his mother's death. He entered the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison|University of Wisconsin]] in 1923. While in college, he joined the [[Zeta Psi]] fraternity. He raised the needed membership fees partly by playing billiards. He was initiated as a member of [[Tau Beta Pi]] engineering honor society. He chose engineering because he did not want to be an academic like his father. He also felt that engineering had good job prospects.<ref name="John Bardeen 1">{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/transistor/album1/bardeen/index.html |title=Biography of John Bardeen 1 |access-date=December 24, 2007 |publisher=PBS}}</ref>

Bardeen received his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in [[electrical engineering]] in 1928 from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]].<ref name="CV of Bardeen">{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1972/bardeen-cv.html |title=Curriculum Vitae of John Bardeen| access-date=November 1, 2007 |publisher = The Nobel Foundation }}</ref> He graduated in 1928 despite taking a year off to work in Chicago.<ref name="genius in action">{{cite web |url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/17406 |title=John Bardeen: genius in action |access-date=January 7, 2008 |author=David Pines |date=May 1, 2003 |publisher=physicsworld.com |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071020192456/http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/17406 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = October 20, 2007}}</ref> He took all the graduate courses in physics and mathematics that had interested him, and he graduated in five years instead of the usual four. This allowed him time to complete his Master's thesis, which was supervised by Leo J. Peters. He received his [[Master of Science]] degree in electrical engineering in 1929 from Wisconsin.<ref name=mathgene/><ref name="CV of Bardeen"/>

Bardeen furthered his studies by staying on at Wisconsin, but he eventually went to work for [[University of Pittsburgh Applied Research Center|Gulf Research Laboratories]], the research arm of the [[Gulf Oil]] Corporation that was based in [[Pittsburgh]].<ref name="washpost"/> From 1930 to 1933, Bardeen worked there on the development of methods for the interpretation of magnetic and gravitational surveys.<ref name="Biography of John Bardeen"/> He worked as a geophysicist. After the work failed to keep his interest, he applied and was accepted to the graduate program in mathematics at [[Princeton University]].<ref name="John Bardeen 1"/>

As a graduate student, Bardeen studied mathematics and physics. Under physicist [[Eugene Wigner]], he ended up writing his [[thesis]] on a problem in [[solid-state physics]]. Before completing his thesis, he was offered a position as Junior Fellow of the [[Harvard Society of Fellows|Society of Fellows at Harvard University]] in 1935. He spent the next three years there, from 1935 to 1938, working with to-be [[List of Nobel laureates in Physics|Nobel laureates in physics]] [[John Hasbrouck van Vleck]] and [[Percy Williams Bridgman]] on problems in cohesion and electrical conduction in metals, and also did some work on level density of nuclei. He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[mathematical physics]] from Princeton in 1936.<ref name="Biography of John Bardeen"/>

==Career and research==

===World War II Service===
From 1941 to 1944, Bardeen headed the group working on [[Naval mine|magnetic mines]] and [[Torpedo|torpedoes]] and mine and torpedo countermeasures at the [[Naval Ordnance Laboratory]]. During this period, his wife Jane gave birth to a son (Bill, born in 1941) and a daughter (Betsy, born in 1944).<ref>Pines, David. "John Bardeen." (2013). http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/bardeen-john.pdf</ref>

===Bell Labs===
[[File:Bardeen Shockley Brattain 1948.JPG|thumb|John Bardeen, William Shockley and Walter Brattain at Bell Labs, 1948]]
In October 1945, Bardeen began work at [[Bell Labs]]. He was a member of a [[solid-state physics]] group, led by [[William Shockley]] and chemist Stanley Morgan. Other personnel working in the group were [[Walter Brattain]], physicist [[Gerald Pearson]], chemist Robert Gibney, electronics expert Hilbert Moore and several technicians. He moved his family to [[Summit, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/truegeniuslifesc0000hodd |url-access=registration |title=True Genius: The Life and Science of John Bardeen |publisher=Joseph Henry Press |page=[https://archive.org/details/truegeniuslifesc0000hodd/page/117 117] |quote=Soon, however, life in Summit would become easy and rich for the Bardeens. |isbn=9780309084086 |last1=Daitch |first1=Vicki |last2=Hoddeson |first2=Lillian |date=October 28, 2002 }}</ref>

The assignment of the group was to seek a solid-state alternative to fragile glass [[vacuum tube]] amplifiers.  Their first attempts were based on Shockley's ideas about using an external electrical field on a [[semiconductor]] to affect its conductivity. These experiments mysteriously failed every time in all sorts of configurations and materials. The group was at a standstill until Bardeen suggested a theory that invoked surface states that prevented the field from penetrating the semiconductor. The group changed its focus to study these surface states, and they met almost daily to discuss the work.  The rapport of the group was excellent, and ideas were freely exchanged.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/crystalfirebirth00rior |url-access=registration |title=Crystal Fire |publisher=W. W. Norton & Company |page=[https://archive.org/details/crystalfirebirth00rior/page/127 127] |isbn=9780393041248 |last1=Riordan |first1=Michael |last2=Hoddeson |first2=Lillian |year=1997 }}</ref> By the winter of 1946, they had enough results that Bardeen submitted a paper on the surface states to ''[[Physical Review]]''. Brattain started experiments to study the surface states through observations made while shining a bright light on the semiconductor's surface. This led to several more papers (one of them co-authored with Shockley), which estimated the density of the surface states to be more than enough to account for their failed experiments. The pace of the work picked up significantly when they started to surround point contacts between the semiconductor and the conducting wires with [[electrolyte]]s. Moore built a circuit that allowed them to vary the frequency of the input signal easily and suggested that they use ''glycol borate'' (gu), a viscous chemical that did not evaporate. Finally, they began to get some evidence of power amplification when Pearson, acting on a suggestion by Shockley,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/crystalfirebirth00rior |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/crystalfirebirth00rior/page/132 132] |title=Crystal Fire: The Birth of the Information Age |publisher=W. W. Norton & Company |isbn=9780393041248 |last1=Riordan |first1=Michael |last2=Hoddeson |first2=Lillian |year=1997 }}</ref> put a voltage on a droplet of gu placed across a [[p–n junction]].

===The invention of the transistor===
{{main|Transistor|History of the transistor}}
[[File:Replica-of-first-transistor.jpg|thumb|340px|A stylized replica of the first transistor invented at Bell Labs on December 23, 1947]]

On December 23, 1947, Bardeen and Brattain were working without Shockley when they succeeded in creating a [[point-contact transistor]] that achieved amplification. By the next month, [[Bell Labs]]' patent attorneys started to work on the patent applications.<ref name="John Bardeen 2">{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/transistor/album1/bardeen/bardeen2.html |title=Biography of John Bardeen 2 |access-date=December 24, 2007 |publisher=PBS }}</ref>

Bell Labs' attorneys soon discovered that Shockley's field effect principle had been anticipated and patented in 1930 by [[Julius Lilienfeld]], who filed his [[MESFET]]-like patent in Canada on October 22, 1925.<ref>{{patent|US|1745175|"Method and apparatus for controlling electric current" first filing in Canada on October 22, 1925}}</ref>

Shockley publicly took the lion's share of the credit for the invention of transistor; this led to a deterioration of Bardeen's relationship with Shockley.<ref>Diane Kormos Buchwald. ''American Scientist'' 91.2 (Mar.-Apr. 2003): 185–86.</ref> Bell Labs management, however, consistently presented all three inventors as a team. Shockley eventually infuriated and alienated Bardeen and Brattain, and he essentially blocked the two from working on the junction transistor. Bardeen began pursuing a theory for superconductivity and left Bell Labs in 1951. Brattain refused to work with Shockley further and was assigned to another group. Neither Bardeen nor Brattain had much to do with the development of the transistor beyond the first year after its invention.<ref>''Crystal Fire'' p. 278</ref><ref>R Kessler, 1997, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/1997/04/06/absent-at-the-creation/2a432ee5-b1e3-49b9-93f2-ad821d1832dd/  ''Absent at the Creation''], Washington Post Magazine.</ref>

The "transistor" (a [[portmanteau]] of "transconductance" and "resistor") was 1/50 the size of the [[vacuum tube]]s it replaced in televisions and radios, used far less power, was far more reliable, and it allowed electrical devices to become more compact.<ref name="washpost"/>

===University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign===
[[File:Bardeen plaque uiuc.jpg|thumb|right|350px|A commemorative plaque remembering John Bardeen and the theory of superconductivity, at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]]]]

By 1951, Bardeen was looking for a new job. Fred Seitz, a friend of Bardeen, convinced the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] to make Bardeen an offer of $10,000 a year. Bardeen accepted the offer and left Bell Labs.<ref name="John Bardeen 2" /> He joined the engineering and physics faculties at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 1951. He was Professor of Electrical Engineering and of Physics at Illinois. His  [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] student [[Nick Holonyak]] (1954), invented the [[light-emitting diode|LED]] in 1962.<ref name="knightridder">{{cite news |title=Nice Guys Can Finish As Geniuses at University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-01-25/business/0301250052_1_semiconductor-lasers-john-bardeen-true-genius|work=Chicago Tribune: Knight Ridder News Service |date=January 25, 2003 |access-date=August 3, 2007}}</ref>

At Illinois, he established two major research programs, one in the Electrical Engineering Department and one in the Physics Department. The research program in the Electrical Engineering Department dealt with both experimental and theoretical aspects of semiconductors, and the research program in the Physics Department dealt with theoretical aspects of macroscopic quantum systems, particularly superconductivity and quantum liquids.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.physics.uiuc.edu/history/bardeen.htm |title=Biography at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign |access-date=November 6, 2007 |publisher=The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011195706/http://physics.uiuc.edu/history/bardeen.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date=October 11, 2007}}</ref>

He was an active professor at Illinois from 1951 to 1975 and then became Professor Emeritus.<ref name="washpost" /> In his later life, Bardeen remained active in academic research, during which time he focused on understanding the flow of electrons in [[charge density wave]]s (CDWs) through metallic linear chain compounds.

===The Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956===
In 1956, John Bardeen shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] with [[William Shockley]] of Semiconductor Laboratory of Beckman Instruments and [[Walter Brattain]] of Bell Telephone Laboratories "''for their researches on semiconductors and their discovery of the transistor effect''".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1956/index.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956 |access-date=November 6, 2007 |publisher=The Nobel Foundation }}</ref>

At the Nobel Prize ceremony in [[Stockholm]], Brattain and Shockley received their awards that night from [[Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden|King Gustaf VI Adolf]]. Bardeen brought only one of his three children to the Nobel Prize ceremony.

* 1975 [[Franklin Medal]].
* On January 10, 1977, John Bardeen was presented with the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by President [[Gerald Ford]]. He was represented at the ceremony by his son, William Bardeen.
* Bardeen was one of 11 recipients given the Third Century Award from President [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1990 for "exceptional contributions to American society" and was granted a [[Lomonosov Gold Medal|gold medal]] from the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]] in 1988.
* 1987 Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]]<ref>{{cite web|title= Golden Plate Awardees of the American Academy of Achievement |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://achievement.org/our-history/golden-plate-awards/#science-exploration}}</ref>

===Xerox===
Bardeen was also an important adviser to [[Xerox|Xerox Corporation]].  Though quiet by nature, he took the uncharacteristic step of urging Xerox executives to keep their California research center, [[Xerox PARC]], afloat when the parent company was suspicious that its research center would amount to little.

==Personal life==
Bardeen married Jane Maxwell on July 18, 1938. While at Princeton, he met Jane during a visit to his old friends in [[Pittsburgh]].

Bardeen was a scientist with a very unassuming personality. While he served as a professor for almost 40&nbsp;years at the University of Illinois, he was best remembered by neighbors for hosting cookouts where he would prepare food for his friends, many of whom were unaware of his accomplishments at the university. He would always ask his guests if they liked the hamburger bun toasted (since he liked his that way).  He enjoyed playing [[golf]] and going on [[picnic]]s with his family.  Lillian Hoddeson, a University of Illinois historian who wrote a book on Bardeen, said that because he "differed radically from the popular stereotype of 'genius' and was uninterested in appearing other than ordinary, the public and the media often overlooked him."<ref name="knightridder"/>

When Bardeen was asked about his beliefs during a 1988 interview, he responded: "I am not a religious person, and so do not think about it very much". However, he has also said: "I feel that science cannot provide an answer to the ultimate questions about the meaning and purpose of life." Bardeen did believe in a code of moral values and behaviour.<ref>{{cite book|title=True Genius: The Life and Science of John Bardeen|url=https://archive.org/details/truegeniuslifesc0000hodd|url-access=registration|year=2002|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|isbn=9780309169547|first1=Lillian|last1= Hoddeson|first2=Vicki|last2= Daitch|quote=John's mother, Althea, had been reared in the Quaker tradition, and his stepmother, Ruth, was Catholic, but John was resolutely secular throughout his life. He was once "taken by surprise" when an interviewer asked him a question about religion. "I am not a religious person," he said, "and so do not think about it very much." He went on in a rare elaboration of his personal beliefs. "I feel that science cannot provide an answer to the ultimate questions about the meaning and purpose of life. With religion, one can get answers on faith. Most scientists leave them open and perhaps unanswerable, but do abide by a code of moral values. For a civilized society to succeed, there must be a common consensus on moral values and moral behaviour, with due regard to the welfare of our fellow man. There are likely many sets of moral values compatible with successful civilized society. It is when they conflict that difficulties arise."}}</ref> John Bardeen's children were taken to church by his wife, who taught Sunday school and was a church elder.<ref>Daitch & Hoddeson (2002). ''True Genius:: The Life and Science of John Bardeen''. Joseph Henry Press, pp. 168–169.</ref> Despite this, he and his wife made it clear that they did not have faith in an afterlife and other religious ideas.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Vicki Daitch, Lillian Hoddeson|title=True Genius:: The Life and Science of John Bardeen|date=2002|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|isbn=9780309169547|page=313|chapter=Last Journey|quote="Every time we attend a funeral service," Jane had once told her sister Betty, "we decide again that we want no such ceremony when we die." She and John agreed that the family could, if they wanted to, have a memorial service conducted by friends and family, "but not a sermon by a stranger, who, if a minister, is bound to dwell on life after death and other religious ideas in which we have no faith."}}</ref>

===Death===
Bardeen died of [[heart disease]] at age 82 at [[Brigham and Women's Hospital]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], on January 30, 1991.<ref name=obit/>  Although he lived in [[Urbana, Illinois|Champaign-Urbana]], he had come to Boston for medical consultation.<ref name="washpost"/> Bardeen and his wife Jane (1907–1997) are buried in [[Forest Hill Cemetery (Madison, Wisconsin)|Forest Hill Cemetery]], Madison, Wisconsin.<ref>''https://www.flickr.com/photos/centralhistorian/383446449/'', Retrieved September 30, 2009.</ref> They were survived by three children, [[James M.

===Legacy===
{{quote box|align=right|width=33%|quote = Near the end of this decade, when they begin enumerating the names of the people who had the greatest impact on the 20th century, the name of John Bardeen, who died last week, has to be near, or perhaps even arguably at, the top of the list ... Mr. Bardeen shared two Nobel Prizes and has been awarded numerous other honors.  But what greater honor can there be when each of us can look all around us and everywhere see the reminders of a man whose genius has made our lives longer, healthier and better.|source= —''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' editorial, February 3, 1991}}

In honor of Professor Bardeen, the engineering [[Quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangle]] at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign is named the Bardeen Quad.

Also in honor of Bardeen, [[Sony]] Corporation endowed a $3&nbsp;million John Bardeen professorial chair at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, beginning in 1990.<ref name=obit>{{cite news|author=John Noble Wilford |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/31/obituaries/dr-john-bardeen-82-winner-of-nobel-prize-for-transistor-dies.html |quote=John Bardeen, a co-inventor of the transistor that led to modern electronics and twice a winner of the Nobel Prize in Physics, died yesterday at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.

The current John Bardeen Professor is [[Nick Holonyak]], Bardeen's doctoral student and protege.

At the time of Bardeen's death, then-University of Illinois chancellor Morton Weir said, "It is a rare person whose work changes the life of every American; John's did."<ref name="chisuntimes2"/>

Bardeen was honored on a March 6, 2008, United States [[postage stamp]] as part of the "American Scientists" series designed by artist [[Victor Stabin]].  The $0.41 stamp was unveiled in a ceremony at the University of Illinois.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.engr.uiuc.edu/news/?xId=072808960714 |title=Bardeen Stamp Celebrated at Campus Ceremony |access-date=March 4, 2008 |publisher=University of Illinois }}</ref>  His citation reads: "Theoretical physicist John Bardeen (1908–1991) shared the Nobel Prize in Physics twice—in 1956, as co-inventor of the transistor and in 1972, for the explanation of superconductivity.  The transistor paved the way for all modern electronics, from computers to microchips.  Diverse applications of superconductivity include infrared sensors and medical imaging systems."  The other scientists on the "American Scientists" sheet include biochemist [[Gerty Cori]], chemist [[Linus Pauling]] and astronomer [[Edwin Hubble]].
