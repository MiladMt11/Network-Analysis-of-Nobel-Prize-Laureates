'''Leo James Rainwater''' (December 9, 1917 – May 31, 1986) was an American physicist who shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1975 for his part in determining the asymmetrical shapes of certain [[atomic nuclei]].

During [[World War II]], he worked on the [[Manhattan Project]] that developed the first [[atomic bomb]]s. In 1949, he began developing his theory that, contrary to what was then believed, not all [[atomic nuclei]] are spherical. His ideas were later tested and confirmed by [[Aage Bohr]]'s and [[Ben Mottelson]]'s experiments. He also contributed to the scientific understanding of [[X-ray]]s and participated in the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] and naval research projects.

Rainwater joined the physics faculty at Columbia in 1946, where he reached the rank of full professor in 1952 and was named Pupin Professor of Physics in 1982. He received the [[Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award]] for Physics in 1963 and in 1975 was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], "for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the structure of the [[atomic nucleus]] based on this connection".<ref name="Nobel Prize">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1975/index.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1975 |publisher=Nobel Foundation |access-date=January 16, 2014}}</ref>

==Early life==
Leo James Rainwater was born on December 9, 1917, in [[Council, Idaho]], the son of a former civil engineer who ran the local general store,<ref name="Nobel Bio">{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1975/rainwater-bio.html |title=James Rainwater – Biographical|publisher=Nobel Foundation |access-date=March 28, 2015 }}</ref> Leo Jaspar Rainwater and his wife Edna Eliza née Teague.<ref name="NNDB">{{cite web |url=http://www.nndb.com/people/901/000099604/ |title=James Rainwater |publisher=Soylent Communications |access-date=March 28, 2015 }}</ref> He never used his first name and was always referred to as James or Jim. His father died in the [[Spanish flu|great influenza epidemic of 1918]] and Rainwater and his mother moved to [[Hanford, California]], where she married George Fowler, a widower with two sons, Freeman and John. In time he also acquired a half-brother, George Fowler, Jr., who became naval officer. At high school he excelled in mathematics, chemistry and physics and was admitted to the [[California Institute of Technology]] on the strength of a chemistry competition.<ref name="NNDB"/>{{sfn|Fitch|2009|pp=3–4}} He received his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree as a physics major in 1939.<ref name="ACAP">{{cite web |url=http://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?rainwaterj |title=L.

==Manhattan Project==
Rainwater then chose to undertake postgraduate studies at [[Columbia University]]. At the time this was an unusual move for a scholar from California, as Columbia was not then renowned for its physics; but this had recently changed. [[George B. Pegram]] had recently built up the physics department, and hired scientists like [[Enrico Fermi]].{{sfn|Fitch|2009|pp=3–4}} At Columbia Rainwater studied under [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]], Enrico Fermi, [[Edward Teller]] and [[John R. Dunning]].<ref name="Nobel Bio" /> Fermi was engaged in [[neutron moderator]] studies that would lead to the construction of the first nuclear reactor, while Dunning and [[Eugene T. Booth]] had built Columbia's first [[cyclotron]], in the basement of the [[Pupin Hall|Pupin Physics Laboratories]].{{sfn|Fitch|2009|p=5}} Rainwater received his [[Master of Arts]] in 1941.<ref name="ACAP" /> For his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] thesis on "Neutron beam spectrometer studies of boron, cadmium, and the energy distribution from paraffin",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://clio.columbia.edu/catalog/1514088 |title=Neutron beam spectrometer studies of boron, cadmium, and the energy distribution from paraffin |last=Rainwater |first=L. James |year=1946 |publisher=Columbia University |access-date=March 28, 2015 }}</ref> written under Dunning's supervision, he built a [[Neutron spectroscopy|neutron spectrometer]] and developed techniques for its use.{{sfn|Fitch|2009|p=5}} Rainwater married Emma Louise Smith in March 1942.<ref name="Nobel Bio" /> They had three sons, James, Robert and William and a daughter, Elizabeth Ann, who died from leukaemia when she was nine.{{sfn|Fitch|2009|p=14}}

Fermi's reactor group moved to the [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1942. Rainwater remained at Columbia, where he joined the [[Manhattan Project]]'s Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories. The Manhattan Project was the Allied effort during [[World War II]] to develop [[atomic bomb]]s. The SAM Laboratories'  primary task was the development of [[gaseous diffusion]] technology for [[uranium enrichment]], to produce [[fissile]] [[uranium-235]] for use in atomic bombs. Rainwater worked with [[William W. Havens, Jr.]] and [[Chien-Shiung Wu]], mostly on studies of [[neutron cross section]]s, using the neutron spectrometer.<ref name="Nobel Bio" /> After the war, a dozen papers by Dunning, Havens, Rainwater and Wu would be declassified and published.{{sfn|Fitch|2009|p=18}} So too was his thesis, published in the [[Physical Review]] in two parts with Havens's thesis,<ref>{{cite journal

==Later life==
Rainwater remained at Columbia as an instructor. In 1948, he began teaching courses on nuclear structure. [[Niels Bohr]] and [[John Archibald Wheeler|John Wheeler]] had developed a theoretical treatment for [[nuclear fission]] in 1939 that they based on the [[liquid drop model]] of the nucleus.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bohr |first=Niels |last2=Wheeler |first2=John Archibald |author-link2=John Archibald Wheeler |title=The Mechanism of Nuclear Fission |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=56 |issue=5 |pages=426–450 |date=September 1939 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.56.426|url=http://www.pugetsound.edu/files/resources/7579_Bohr%20liquid%20drop.pdf|bibcode = 1939PhRv...56..426B |doi-access=free }}</ref> This was superseded in 1949 by [[Maria Goeppert Mayer]]'s [[nuclear shell model]], which could explain more about the structure of heavy elements than the older theory but it still had limits. At a colloquium at Columbia in 1949, [[Charles H. Townes]] reported experimental results that indicated [[quadrupole]] moments greater than those indicated by the shell model. It occurred to Rainwater that this could be explained and the differences between the liquid drop and nuclear shell models could be reconciled, if the [[atomic nucleus]] were not spherical, as had been assumed but could assume other shapes.{{sfn|Havens|1986|p=142}} Rainwater published his theoretical paper in 1950.<ref>{{cite journal

Bohr and [[Ben Mottelson]] published their results in three papers in 1952 and 1953 that conclusively confirmed the theory.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1975/presentation-speech.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1975 – Award Ceremony Speech |publisher=Nobel Foundation |access-date=March 28, 2015 }}</ref> Rainwater felt that his model was overlooked. He later recalled that:

{{quote|When I made my proposal for use of a spheroidal nuclear model, it seemed to be an obvious answer which would immediately be simultaneously suggested by all theorists in the field. I do not understand why it was not. I was also surprised and dismayed to hear one or more respected theorists announce in every Nuclear Physics Conference which I attended through 1955 some such comment as, "Although the Nuclear Shell Model seems empirically to work very well, there is at present no theoretical justification as to why it should apply."<ref>{{Nobelprize}} including the Nobel Lecture, December 11, 1975 ''Background for the Spheroidal Nuclear Model Proposal''</ref> }}

With funding from the [[Office of Naval Research]],<ref name="Nobel Bio" /> Rainwater built a [[synchrotron]], which became operational in 1950, at the [[Nevis Laboratories]], on an estate on the [[Hudson River]] at [[Irvington, New York]], willed to Columbia University by the [[DuPont]] family.{{sfn|Fitch|2009|p=15}} He became a full professor in 1952 and was the director of Nevis Laboratories from 1951 to 1954 and again from 1957 to 1961.{{sfn|Havens|1986|p=142}} He worked with his student [[Val Fitch]] on studies of [[muonic atom]]s, atoms where an [[electron]] is replaced by a [[muon]].<ref>{{cite journal

When a reporter rang in 1975 to inform him that he had won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], he initially thought that it was for his work on muonic atoms. Several hours passed before he discovered that it was for his work on nuclear structure, the Nobel Prize being shared with Bohr and Mottelson.{{sfn|Havens|1986|p=142}}

He was a fellow of the [[American Physical Society]], the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] and the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]], and was a member of the [[National Academy of Science]], the [[American Institute of Physics]], the [[American Association of Physics Teachers]] and the [[Optical Society of America]].{{sfn|Fitch|2009|p=16}}

Rainwater succeeded [[Robert R. Wilson]] as  Michael I. Pupin Professor of Physics in 1983.<ref name="New York Times"/>

Rainwater collapsed after a lecture at the Pupin Laboratories in 1985 but was revived by a student who knew how to administer [[CPR]].{{sfn|Fitch|2009|p=15}} In declining health, he retired and became a professor emeritus in February 1986. He died from cardiopulmonary arrest<ref name="NNDB"/> at St. John's Riverside Hospital in [[Yonkers, New York]] on May 31, 1986. He was survived by his wife, three sons and half-brother George.<ref name="New York Times">{{cite news |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |title=James Rainwater Dead at 68; Won Nobel for Atom Study |first=Thomas W. |last=Ennis |date=June 3, 1986 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/03/obituaries/james-rainwater-dead-at-68-won-nobel-for-atom-study.html |access-date=March 28, 2015 }}</ref>
