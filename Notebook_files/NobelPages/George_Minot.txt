'''George Richards Minot''' (December 2, 1885 – February 25, 1950) was an American medical researcher who shared the 1934 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] with [[George Hoyt Whipple]] and [[William P. Murphy]] for their pioneering work on [[pernicious anemia]].

==Education==
Minot obtained his B.A. from [[Harvard College]] in 1908, where he was elected to [[Owl Club (Harvard)|The Owl Club]], and obtained his M.D. degree in 1912 from the [[Harvard University|Harvard Medical School]]. Between 1913 and 1915, he worked in the [[William Henry Howell]]'s lab at [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]], studying blood thinning proteins, such as [[antithrombin]]. In 1915, he secured a junior position on the medical staff of the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]], where he started research on blood [[anemia]]. During the first world war, he served as a surgeon in for the US Army.  As part of those duties, he worked with [[Alice Hamilton]] to understand what was causing workers at a munitions plant in New Jersey to become ill. They eventually discovered that skin contact with TNT led to the sicknesses.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alice Hamilton a pioneer in occupational health|url=https://tacomed.com/chapter-one-george-minot/alice-hamilton-a-pioneer-in-occupational-health/|website=Tacomed.com|access-date=16 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171228171621/https://tacomed.com/chapter-one-george-minot/alice-hamilton-a-pioneer-in-occupational-health/|archive-date=2017-12-28|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Career==
In 1917, he came to Collis P. Huntington Memorial Hospital in Boston; he became chief of medical services in 1923, and was appointed physician-in-chief in 1934. In addition, Minot became professor of medicine at the Harvard University, and was appointed director of the Thorndik Memorial Laboratory at [[Boston City Hospital]]. He also worked in the Peter Bent Brigham Hospital as a staff member. He was a member of the Pernicious Anemia Committee at Harvard and served on the Anti-Anemia Preparation Advisory Board of the [[United States Pharmacopeia|U.S. Pharmacopoeia]].<ref>David Y. Cooper.

In 1930, Minot was awarded the [[Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh]] with [[William P. Murphy]]. Minot shared the 1934 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] with [[William P. Murphy]] and [[George H. Whipple]] given for their work on the treatment of blood [[anemia]].<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1934/ The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1934], ''Nobelprize.org'', Nobel Media AB 2014. Retrieved December 2, 2015.</ref> They all discovered an effective treatment for [[pernicious anemia]], which was a terminal disease at the time, with liver concentrate high in [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B<sub>12</sub>]], later identified as the critical compound in the treatment.

Minot was diagnosed with [[diabetes mellitus]] in 1921 at the age of 35, by Dr [[Elliott P. Joslin]], a fellow professor at Harvard Medical School and one of the leading diabetes doctors of his time. Diabetes was a fatal disease at the time. Joslin kept him alive the only way he knew, by restricting food.  Minot was 6 feet one inches tall and only weighed 135 pounds.  Joslin put him on a diet of only 530 calories per day.  Minot, like most every diabetes patient, at the time, would probably die within a year.

However, insulin was discovered at about the same time Minot was diagnosed.  Insulin became widely available about a year later.  Dr. [[William Bosworth Castle|William Castle]] observed that [[Frederick Banting]]'s and [[Charles Herbert Best|Charles Best]]'s discovery of [[insulin]] in 1921, not only transformed diabetes treatment, but also, by keeping Minot alive, contributed towards the discovery of a cure for [[pernicious anemia]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Castle |first=W B|author-link=William Bosworth Castle|year=1962 |title=The Gordon Wilson Lecture: A century of curiosity about pernicious anemia|journal= Trans Am Clin Climatol Assoc|volume=73|pages=54–80| pmid = 21408623|pmc= 2249021}}</ref>

Minot began developing complications associated with diabetes in 1940, and suffered a serious stroke in 1947, which partially paralyzed him.<ref name=NHL/> He died in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] on February 25, 1950.<ref name="mayo"/> He was a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/228/000127844/|title=George R.

Minot and his wife Marian Linzee Minot (Weld) (1890-1979), whom he married in 1915, had two daughters and a son.
