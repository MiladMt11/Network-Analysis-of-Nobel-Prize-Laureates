'''George Elwood Smith''' (born May 10, 1930) is an American scientist, applied [[physicist]], and co-inventor of the [[charge-coupled device]] (CCD). He was awarded a one-quarter share in the 2009 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for "the invention of an imaging semiconductor circuitâ€”the CCD sensor, which has become an electronic eye in almost all areas of photography".<ref>{{citation | title = The Nobel Prize in Physics 2009 | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2009/index.html | publisher = Nobel Foundation | date = 2009-10-06 | access-date = 2009-10-06}}.</ref> 

==Early life==
Smith was born in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], [[New York (state)|New York]].  Smith served in the US Navy, and subsequently obtained his [[Bachelor of Science|B.Sc.]] degree from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1955 and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1959 with a dissertation of only eight pages.<ref name="proquest">{{citation | title = THE ANOMALOUS SKIN EFFECT IN BISMUTH | publisher = University of Chicago | date = 1959-12-06 | id = {{ProQuest|301893432}} }}</ref> 

==Career==
He worked at [[Bell Labs]] in [[Murray Hill, New Jersey]] from 1959 to his retirement in 1986, where he led research into novel lasers and semiconductor devices.  During his tenure, Smith was awarded dozens of patents and eventually headed the [[VLSI]] device department.<ref name="Earthtimes">{{citation | title = PROFILE: George Smith - Nobel winner and world sailor | url = http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/288984,profile-george-smith--nobel-winner-and-world-sailor.html | publisher = EarthTimes | date = 2009-10-06 | access-date = 2009-10-06}}.</ref>

In 1969, Smith and [[Willard Boyle]] invented the [[Charge-Coupled Device]] (CCD),<ref name="Nobelpressrelease">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=George E.|title=Les Prix Nobel.

Smith|editor=Karl Grandin|access-date=22 May 2012}}</ref>  for which they have jointly received the [[Franklin Institute]]'s [[Stuart Ballantine Medal]] in 1973, the 1974 [[IEEE Morris N. Liebmann Memorial Award]], the 2006 [[Charles Stark Draper Prize]], and the 2009 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].

Both Boyle and Smith were avid sailors who took many trips together.  After retirement Smith sailed around the world with his life partner, Janet, for seventeen years, eventually giving up his hobby in 2003 to "spare his 'creaky bones' from further storms".<ref name="Earthtimes" /> He currently resides in the [[Waretown, New Jersey|Waretown]] section of [[Ocean Township, Ocean County, New Jersey]].<ref>Staff. [http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/technology&id=7050733 "NJ man's discovery lands Nobel Prize"], [[WPVI-TV]], October 6, 2009. Accessed November 27, 2013. "George E. Smith, 79, holds a display with a photograph of the first video telephone and some early CCD chips at his home in Waretown, N.J., Tuesday, Oct. 6, 2009, after it was announced that he had won the Nobel Prize in physics."</ref>

In 2015, Smith was awarded the Progress Medal and Honorary Fellowship of the [[Royal Photographic Society]]. He is a member of Pi Mu Epsilon, [[Phi Beta Kappa]], and Sigma Xi and a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) and American Physical Society and a member of the National Academy of Engineering.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nae.edu/54987/Dr-George-E-Smith|title = Dr. George e.

In 2017, Smith was announced as one of four winners of the [[Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering]], for his contribution to the creation of digital imaging sensors.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://qeprize.org/winner-2017/|title=2017 QEPrize Winners - Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering|work=Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering|access-date=2017-03-10|language=en-GB}}</ref>
