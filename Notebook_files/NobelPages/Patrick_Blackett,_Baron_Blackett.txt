==Early life and education==
Blackett was born in [[Kensington]], London, the son of Arthur Stuart [[Blackett]], a stockbroker, and his wife Caroline Maynard.<ref name="kirby">{{Cite book|last1 = Kirby |first1 = M. W.|last2 = Rosenhead|first2 = J.|chapter = Patrick Blackett|doi = 10.1007/978-1-4419-6281-2_1|title = Profiles in Operations Research|series = International Series in Operations Research & Management Science|volume = 147|pages = 1|year = 2011|isbn = 978-1-4419-6280-5}}</ref> His younger sister was the psychoanalyst [[Marion Milner]]. His paternal grandfather Rev. Henry Blackett, brother of [[Edmund Blacket]] the Australian architect, was for many years vicar of [[Croydon]]. His maternal grandfather Charles Maynard was an officer in the Royal Artillery at the time of the [[Indian Mutiny]]. The Blackett family lived successively at [[Kensington]], [[Kenley]], [[Woking]] and [[Guildford]], Surrey, where Blackett went to [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]]. His main hobbies were [[model aeroplanes]] and [[crystal radio]]. When he went for interview for entrance to the [[Royal Naval College, Osborne]], Isle of Wight, [[Charles Rolls]] had completed his cross-channel flight the previous day and Blackett who had tracked the flight on his crystal set was able to expound lengthily on the subject. He was accepted and spent two years there before moving on to [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Dartmouth]] where he was "usually head of his class".<ref>{{cite book |author-link=Bernard Lovell |first=Bernard |last=Lovell |title=P. M. S. Blackett: A Biographical Memoir |publisher=John Wright & Sons |year=1976 |isbn=0854030778 |pages=1–3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rBNNAQAAIAAJ }}</ref>

In August 1914 on the outbreak of [[World War I]] Blackett was assigned to active service as a [[midshipman]]. He was transferred to the [[Cape Verde]] Islands on [[HMS Carnarvon (1903)|HMS ''Carnarvon'']] and was present at the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]]. He was then transferred to [[HMS Barham (04)|HMS ''Barham'']] and saw much action at the [[Battle of Jutland]]. While on HMS ''Barham'', Blackett was co-inventor of a gunnery device on which the [[British Admiralty|Admiralty]] took out a patent. In 1916 he applied to join the [[RNAS]] but his application was refused. In October that year he became a sub-lieutenant on HMS ''P17'' on [[Dover]] patrol, and in July 1917 he was posted to [[HMS Sturgeon|HMS ''Sturgeon'']] in the [[Harwich Force]] under [[Reginald Tyrwhitt|Admiral Tyrwhitt]]. Blackett was particularly concerned by the poor quality of gunnery in the force compared with that of the enemy and of his own previous experience, and started to read science textbooks. He was promoted to lieutenant in May 1918, but had decided to leave the Navy. Then, in January 1919, the Admiralty sent the officers whose training had been interrupted by the war to the [[University of Cambridge]] for a course of general duties. On his first night at [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]], he met [[Kingsley Martin]] and [[Geoffrey Webb]], later recalling that he had never before, in his naval training, heard intellectual conversation. Blackett was impressed by the prestigious [[Cavendish Laboratory]], and left the Navy to study mathematics and physics at Cambridge.<ref>{{harvnb|Lovell|1976|pp=3–5}}</ref>

==Career and research==
After graduating from Magdalene College in 1921, Blackett spent ten years working at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] as an experimental physicist with [[Ernest Rutherford]] and in 1923 became a fellow of [[King's College, Cambridge]], a position he held until 1933.

Rutherford had found out that the nucleus of the [[nitrogen]] atom could be disintegrated by firing fast [[alpha particles]] into nitrogen. He asked Blackett to use a [[cloud chamber]] to find visible tracks of this disintegration, and by 1925, he had taken 23,000 photographs showing 415,000 tracks of ionized particles. Eight of these were forked, and this showed that the nitrogen atom-alpha particle combination had formed an atom of [[fluorine]], which then disintegrated into an isotope of [[oxygen]] 17 and a proton. Blackett published the results of his experiments in 1925.<ref>Blackett, Patrick Maynard Stewart (2 Feb. 1925) "The Ejection of Protons From Nitrogen Nuclei, Photographed by the Wilson Method", ''Journal of the Chemical Society Transactions''. Series A, 107(742), pp. 349–60</ref> He thus became the first person to deliberately transmute one [[chemical element|element]] into another.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://history.aip.org/history/exhibits/rutherford/sections/atop-physics-wave.html |title = Rutherford's Nuclear World: The Story of the Discovery of the Nucleus &#124; Sections &#124; American Institute of Physics}}</ref>

Blackett spent some time in 1924–1925 at [[Göttingen]], Germany, working with [[James Franck]] on [[atomic spectra]]. In 1932, working with [[Giuseppe Occhialini]], he devised a system of [[Geiger counter]]s which took photographs only when a [[cosmic ray]] particle traversed the chamber. They found 500 tracks of high energy cosmic ray particles in 700 automatic exposures. In 1933, Blackett discovered fourteen tracks which confirmed the existence of the [[positron]] and revealed the now instantly recognisable opposing spiral traces of positron/electron [[pair production]]. This work and that on [[annihilation radiation]] made him one of the first and leading experts on [[anti-matter]].

That year he moved to [[Birkbeck, University of London]], as professor of Physics for four years. Then in 1937 he went to the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] where he was elected to the [[Langworthy Professor]]ship and created a major international research laboratory. The Blackett Memorial Hall and Blackett lecture theatre at the University of Manchester were named after him.

In 1947, Blackett introduced [[Blackett effect|a theory]] to account for the [[Earth's magnetic field]] as a function of its rotation, with the hope that it would unify both the [[electromagnetic force]] and the force of [[gravity]]. He spent a number of years developing high-quality [[magnetometer]]s to test his theory, and eventually found it to be without merit. His work on the subject, however, led him into the field of [[geophysics]], where he eventually helped process data relating to [[paleomagnetism]] and helped to provide strong evidence for [[continental drift]].

In 1948 he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], for his investigation of cosmic rays using his invention of the counter-controlled [[cloud chamber]].

Blackett was appointed head of the Physics Department of [[Imperial College London]] in 1953 and retired in July 1963. The Physics department building of Imperial College, the [[Blackett Laboratory]] is named in his honour.

In 1957 Blackett gave the presidential address ("Technology and World Advancement") to the [[British Science Association|British Association]] meeting in Dublin.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Blackett, P. M. S.|title=Technology and World Advancement|date=November 1957|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|volume=13|issue=9|page=323|doi=10.1080/00963402.1957.11457591|bibcode=1957BuAtS..13i.323B}}</ref> In 1965 he was invited to deliver the MacMillan Memorial Lecture to the [[Institution of Engineers and Shipbuilders in Scotland]]. He chose the subject "Continental Drift".<ref name="MacmillanLecture">{{cite web |url=http://www.iesis.org/macmillan.html |title=Hugh Miller Macmillan |work=Macmillan Memorial Lectures |publisher=The Institution of Engineers & Shipbuilders in Scotland Limited |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103193622/http://www.iesis.org/macmillan.html |archive-date=3 November 2013 |access-date=16 July 2014 }}</ref>

===World War II and operational research===
In 1935 Blackett was invited to join the [[Aeronautical Research Committee]] chaired by [[Henry Tizard|Sir Henry Tizard]]. The committee was effective pressing for the early installation of [[Radar]] for [[Anti-aircraft warfare|air defence]]. In the early part of [[World War II]], Blackett served on various committees and spent time at the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] (RAE) [[Farnborough Airfield|Farnborough]], where he made a major contribution to the design of the [[Mark XIV bomb sight]] which allowed bombs to be released without a level bombing run beforehand. In 1940–41 Blackett served on the [[MAUD Committee]] which concluded that an [[atomic bomb]] was feasible. He disagreed with the committee's conclusion that Britain could produce an atomic bomb by 1943, and recommended that the project should be discussed with the Americans. He was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1933|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1933]]<ref name=frs/> and awarded its [[Royal Medal]] in 1940.

In August 1940 Blackett became scientific adviser to Lieutenant General [[Sir Frederick Pile]], Commander in Chief of [[Anti-Aircraft Command]] and thus began the work that resulted in the field of study known as [[operational research]] (OR). He was director of Operational Research with the [[British Admiralty|Admiralty]] from 1942 to 1945, and his work with [[Evan James Williams|E. J. Williams]] improved the survival odds of [[convoy]]s, presented counter-intuitive but correct recommendations for the armour-plating of aircraft and achieved many other successes. His aim, he said, was to find numbers on which to base strategy, not gusts of emotion. During the war he criticised the assumptions in [[Lord Cherwell]]'s [[dehousing]] paper and sided with Tizard who argued that fewer resources should go to [[RAF Bomber Command]] for the [[area bombing]] offensive and more to the other armed forces, as his studies had shown the ineffectiveness of the bombing strategies, as opposed to the importance of fighting of the [[Germany|German]] [[U-boats]], which were heavily affecting the war effort with their [[Battle of the Atlantic|sinkings of merchant ships]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Norman |last=Longmate |title=The bombers: the RAF offensive against Germany, 1939–1945 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gvRmAAAAMAAJ |year=1983 |publisher=Hutchinson |isbn=978-0-09-151580-5 |page=132}}</ref><ref name=PH-181>{{cite book |first=Peter |last=Hore |title=Patrick Blackett: Sailor, Scientist, Socialist |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5jW14KVeYU0C&pg=PA181 |year=2002 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-7146-5317-4 |page=181}}</ref> In this opinion he chafed against the existing military authority and was cut out of various circles of communications. However, after the war, the Allied [[Strategic Bombing Survey]] proved Blackett correct.

===Politics===
Blackett became friends with [[Kingsley Martin]], later editor of the ''[[New Statesman]]'', while an undergraduate and became committed to the left. Politically he identified himself as a socialist, and often campaigned on behalf of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. In the late 1940s, Blackett became known for his radical political opinions, which included his belief that Britain ought not develop atomic weapons. He was considered too far to the left for the [[Labour Government 1945–1951]] to employ, and he returned to academic life. His internationalism found expression in his strong support for India. There in 1947 he met [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], who sought his advice on the research and development needs of the [[Indian armed forces]] and for the next 20 years he was a frequent visitor and advisor on military and civil science. These visits deepened his concern for the underprivileged and the poor. He was convinced that the problem could be solved by applying science and technology and he used his scientific prestige to try and persuade scientists that one of their first duties was to use their skill to ensure a decent life for all mankind.  Before underdevelopment became a popular issue he proposed in a presidential address to the [[British Association]] that Britain should devote 1% of its national income to the [[Development aid|economic improvement of the third world]] and he was later one of the prime movers in the foundation of the [[Overseas Development Institute]]. He was the senior member of a group of scientists which met regularly to discuss scientific and technological policy during the 13 years when the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] was out of office, and this group became influential when [[Harold Wilson]] became leader of the Party. Blackett's ideas led directly to the creation of the [[Minister of Technology|Ministry of Technology]] as soon as the [[Labour Government 1964–1970|Wilson government]] was formed and he insisted that the first priority was revival of the [[computer industry]]. He did not enter open politics, but worked for a year as a civil servant. He remained deputy chairman of the Minister's Advisory Council throughout the administration's life, and was also personal scientific adviser to the Minister.

==Personal life==
Blackett was an agnostic or atheist.<ref>"The grandson of a vicar on his father’s side, Blackett respected religious observances that were established social customs, but described himself as agnostic or atheist." Mary Jo Nye: "Blackett, Patrick Maynard Stuart." Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography, Vol. 19 p. 293. Detroit: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2008.</ref> Blackett had refused many honours in the manner of a radical of the twenties but accepted a [[Order of the Companions of Honour|Companion of Honour]] in the [[1965 Birthday Honours]],<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=43667 |date=12 June 1965 |page=5496 |supp=y}}</ref> and was appointed to the [[Order of Merit]] in 1967.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=44460 |date=24 November 1967 |page=12859}}</ref> He was created a [[life peer]] on 27 January 1969 as '''Baron Blackett''', ''of [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] in [[Greater London]]''.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=44776 |date=28 January 1969 |page=1008}}</ref> However, the greatest honour of all for him was when he was made President of the [[Royal Society]] in 1965. The crater [[Blackett (crater)|Blackett]] on the [[Moon]] is named after him.

Blackett married Constanza Bayon (1899–1986) in 1924. They had one son and one daughter. His ashes are buried in the [[Kensal Green Cemetery]], London.

[[Bernard Lovell]] wrote of Blackett: "Those who worked with Blackett in the laboratory were dominated by his immensely powerful personality, and those who knew him elsewhere soon discovered that the public image thinly veiled a sensitive and humane spirit".<ref name=frs/>

[[Edward Bullard]] said that he was the most versatile and best loved physicist of his generation and that his achievement was also without rival: "he was wonderfully intelligent, charming, fun to be with, dignified and handsome".<ref>{{Cite journal|last = Bullard|first = Edward|author-link = Edward Bullard|doi = 10.1038/250370a0| title = Patrick Blackett: An appreciation|journal = Nature|volume = 250|issue = 5465|pages = 370|year = 1974|bibcode = 1974Natur.250..370B|s2cid = 4275713}}</ref>

In 2016, the house that Blackett lived in from 1953 to 1969 (48 Paultons Square, Chelsea, London) has received an English Heritage Blue Plaque<ref name="blue">{{cite news|title=Rare double blue plaque award for home of Nobel Prize winners|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-36089471|access-date=28 April 2016|work=BBC News|date=20 April 2016}}</ref>
