'''Jerome Isaac Friedman''' (born March 28, 1930) is an American [[physicist]]. He is Institute Professor and Professor of Physics, ''Emeritus, ''at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. He won the 1990 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] along with [[Henry W. Kendall|Henry Kendall]] and [[Richard E. Taylor|Richard Taylor]], "for their pioneering investigations concerning [[deep inelastic scattering]] of [[electron]]s on [[proton]]s and bound [[neutron]]s, which have been of essential importance for the development of the [[quark model]] in particle physics."<ref name="nobel-citation">{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1990/ |title=Nobel prize citation |publisher=Nobelprize.org |access-date=2011-01-08}}</ref>, work which showed an internal structure for [[protons]] later known to be [[quarks]]. Friedman sits on the Board of Sponsors of the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]''.

==Life and career==
Born in [[Chicago, Illinois]] to Lillian (''née'' Warsaw) and Selig Friedman, a sewing machine salesman, Friedman's Jewish<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.science.co.il/nobel-prizes/Physics.php|title = Jewish Laureates of Nobel Prize in Physics|date = 2013|access-date = June 3, 2014|website = Jewish Laureates of Nobel Prize in Physics|publisher = Israel Science and Technology Homepage}}</ref> parents emigrated to the U.S. from Russia. Jerome Friedman excelled in art but became interested in physics after reading a book on [[theory of relativity|relativity]] written by [[Albert Einstein]]. He turned down a scholarship to the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] in order to study physics at the [[University of Chicago]]. Whilst there he worked under [[Enrico Fermi]], and eventually received his Ph.D in physics in 1956. In 1960, he joined the physics faculty of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].

In 1968–69, commuting between MIT and California, he conducted experiments with [[Henry W. Kendall]] and [[Richard E. Taylor]] at the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]] which gave the first experimental evidence that [[proton]]s had an internal structure, later known to be [[quark]]s. For this, Friedman, Kendall and Taylor shared the 1990 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]. He is an [[Institute Professor]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].  Friedman is also a member of the Board of Sponsors of the [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://thebulletin.org/board-sponsors-0|title = Board of Sponsors|date = 2014|access-date = June 4, 2014|website = Board of Sponsors|publisher = Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists}}</ref>

In 2003, he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the [[Humanism and Its Aspirations|Humanist Manifesto]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III/Notable_Signers |title=Notable Signers |publisher=American Humanist Association |work=Humanism and its Aspirations |access-date=October 2, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121005105825/http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III/Notable_Signers |archive-date=October 5, 2012 }}</ref> He is an atheist.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.merinews.com/article/nobel-laureate-friedman-time-travel-is-not-possible/153326.shtml |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171207112423/http://www.merinews.com/article/nobel-laureate-friedman-time-travel-is-not-possible/153326.shtml |archive-date=December 7, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Friedman is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President [[George W. Bush]] in May 2008, urging him to "reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill" by requesting additional emergency funding for the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]’s [[Office of Science]], the [[National Science Foundation]], and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=A Letter from America's Physics Nobel Laureates|url=https://fire.pppl.gov/nobel_bush_fy08_050808.pdf}}</ref>

In 2008, Friedman received an honorary Ph.D from the [[University of Belgrade]].{{cn|date=July 2019}} He is an honorary professor at the  University of Belgrade's Faculty of Physics and the Faculty's institutes: Institute of Physics, Institute of Physics, Zemun and [[Vinca Nuclear Institute]].{{cn|date=July 2019}}
