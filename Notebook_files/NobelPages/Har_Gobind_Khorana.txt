Har Gobind Khorana married Esther Elizabeth Sibler in 1952. They had met in Switzerland and had three children, Julia Elizabeth, Emily Anne, and Dave Roy.

==Research==
[[RNA|Ribonucleic acid]] (RNA) with two repeating units (UCUCUCU → UCU CUC UCU) produced two alternating [[amino acid]]s. This, combined with the [[Nirenberg and Leder experiment]], showed that UCU genetically codes for [[serine]] and CUC codes for [[leucine]]. RNAs with three repeating units (UACUACUA → UAC UAC UAC, or ACU ACU ACU, or CUA CUA CUA) produced three different strings of amino acids. RNAs with four repeating units including UAG, UAA, or UGA, produced only [[dipeptide]]s and [[tripeptide]]s thus revealing that UAG, UAA, and UGA are [[stop codon]]s.<ref name="nobel"/>

===Subsequent research===
He extended the above to long DNA polymers using non-aqueous chemistry and assembled these into the first synthetic gene, using [[polymerase]] and [[ligase]] enzymes that link pieces of DNA together,<ref name="doi10.1126/science.366749"/> as well as methods that anticipated the invention of [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kleppe |first1=K. |last2=Ohtsuka |first2=E. |last3=Kleppe |first3=R. |last4=Molineux |first4=I. |last5=Khorana |first5=H.

Khorana's invention(s) have become automated and commercialized so that anyone now can order a synthetic [[Oligonucleotide synthesis|oligonucleotide]] or a gene from any of a number of companies. One merely needs to send the [[genetic sequence]] to one of the companies to receive an oligonucleotide with the desired sequence.

After the middle of the 1970s, his lab studied the biochemistry of [[bacteriorhodopsin]], a membrane protein that converts light energy into chemical energy by creating a proton gradient.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wildenauer |first1=D. |last2=Khorana |first2=H.

A summary of his work was provided by a former colleague at the University of Wisconsin: "Khorana was an early practitioner, and perhaps a founding father, of the field of chemical biology. He brought the power of chemical synthesis to bear on deciphering the genetic code, relying on different combinations of trinucleotides."<ref name=CenAcs/><ref name=NobelBio/>

==Awards and honors==
[[File:Har Gobind Khorana receives NIH lecture award.jpg|thumb|Har Gobind Khorana receiving NIH lecture award.]]
In addition to sharing the [[Nobel prize]] (while he was working at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in the U.S.),<ref name="independent.co.uk"/> Khorana was elected as [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1978|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1978]].<ref name="fellows">{{cite web |title=Fellowship of the Royal Society 1660–2015 |url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RVVZY00MZNrK2YCTTzVrbTFH2t3RxoAZah128gQR-NM/pubhtml |publisher=[[Royal Society]] |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015185820/https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RVVZY00MZNrK2YCTTzVrbTFH2t3RxoAZah128gQR-NM/pubhtml |archive-date=15 October 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 2007, the University of Wisconsin–Madison, the Government of India (DBT [[Department of Biotechnology]]), and the Indo-US Science and Technology Forum jointly created the Khorana Program. The mission of the Khorana Program is to build a seamless community of scientists, industrialists, and social entrepreneurs in the United States and India.

The program is focused on three objectives:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://iusstf.org/story/53-50-Khorana-Program.html |title=Khorana Program for Scholars |website=iusstf.org |publisher=Indo-US Science and Technology Forum |location=New Delhi, India |access-date=2018-01-09}}</ref> Providing graduate and undergraduate students with a transformative research experience, engaging partners in rural development and food security, and facilitating public-private partnerships between the U.S. and India. The Wisconsin–India Science and Technology Exchange Program (WINStep Forward, WSF) adopted administration responsibilities for the Khorana program in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.winstepforward.org/history/ |title=History |website=winstepforward.org |publisher=WINStep Forward |location=Madison, WI |access-date=2018-06-26}}</ref> WINStep Forward was jointly created by Drs. Aseem Ansari and Ken Shapiro at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. WINStep Forward also administers the nationally competitive S.N. Bose Programs for Indian and American students, respectively, to promote both fundamental and applied research not only in biotechnology but broadly across all STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields, including medicine, pharmacy, agriculture, wildlife and climate change.

In 2009, Khorana was hosted by the Khorana Program and honored at the 33rd Steenbock Symposium in [[Madison, Wisconsin]].<ref name="news.wisc.edu"/>

Other honors included the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from [[Columbia University]] and the Lasker Foundation Award for Basic Medical Research, both in 1969, the Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]] in 1971,<ref>{{cite web|title= Golden Plate Awardees of the American Academy of Achievement |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://achievement.org/our-history/golden-plate-awards/#science-exploration}}</ref> the Willard Gibbs Medal of the Chicago section of the American Chemical Society, in 1974, the Gairdner Foundation Annual Award, in 1980 and the Paul Kayser International Award of Merit in Retina Research, in 1987.<ref name="mit.edu"/>

==Death==
Khorana died on 9 November 2011, in [[Concord, Massachusetts]], at the age of 89. His wife, Esther, and daughter, Emily Anne, had died earlier,<ref name=CenAcs/> but Khorana was survived by his other two children.<ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/> Julia Elizabeth later wrote about her father's work as a professor: "Even while doing all this research, he was always really interested in education, in students and young people."<ref name="mit.edu"/>
