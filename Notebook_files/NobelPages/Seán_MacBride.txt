'''Seán MacBride''' (26 January 1904 – 15 January 1988) was an Irish [[Clann na Poblachta]] politician who served as [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Minister for External Affairs]] from 1948 to 1951, Leader of Clann na Poblachta from 1946 to 1965 and [[List of Irish Republican Army chiefs of staff|Chief of Staff of the IRA]] from 1936 to 1937. He served as a [[Teachta Dála]] (TD) from 1947 to 1957.<ref name=oireachtas_db>{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/members/member/Se%C3%A1n-MacBride.D.1947-10-29/|title=Seán MacBride|work=Oireachtas Members Database|access-date=22 September 2009|archive-date=20 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190420184813/https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/members/member/Se%C3%A1n-MacBride.D.1947-10-29/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Rising from a domestic Irish political career, he founded or participated in many international organisations of the 20th century, including the [[United Nations]], the [[Council of Europe]] and [[Amnesty International]]. He received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1974, the [[Lenin Peace Prize]] for 1975–1976 and the UNESCO Silver Medal for Service in 1980.

== Early years ==
MacBride was born in [[Paris]] in 1904, the son of Major [[John MacBride]]<ref name="Saturday Evening Post:1949">Saturday Evening Post; 23 April 1949, Vol. 221 Issue 43, pp. 31–174, 5p</ref> and [[Maud Gonne]]. His first language was [[French language|French]], and he retained a French accent in the English language for the rest of his life.<ref name="Ireland, a Television History">{{Citation|title=Ireland - A Television History - Part 10 of 13 - 'Civil War 1921-1923'|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxp9OVvqDuE|language=en|access-date=2019-08-28|archive-date=29 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191229061217/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxp9OVvqDuE&list=PL-NlJbmY3woh0SDUIy2ION2-DWyoz8oxY&index=11|url-status=live}}</ref> He first studied at the [[Lycée Saint-Louis-de-Gonzague]]. He remained in Paris until his father's execution after the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916, when he was sent to school at Mount St Benedict's, [[Gorey]], [[County Wexford]] in Ireland. In 1919, aged 15, he joined the [[Irish Volunteers]], which fought as part of the [[Irish Republican Army (1917–22)|Irish Republican Army]], and took part in the [[Irish War of Independence]]. He opposed the 1921 [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]] and was imprisoned by the [[Irish Free State]] during the [[Irish Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=mac>{{cite book|last=Jordan|first=Anthony J.|year=1993|pages=26–35|title=Seán MacBride: A Biography|location=Dublin|publisher=Blackwater Press|isbn=0-86121-453-6}}</ref>

On his release in 1924, MacBride studied law at [[University College Dublin]] and resumed his IRA activities.<ref name=mac2>Jordan (1993), p. 41.</ref> He worked briefly for [[Éamon de Valera]] as his personal secretary, travelling with him to [[Rome]] to meet various dignitaries.

In January 1925, on his twenty-first birthday, MacBride married Catalina "Kid" Bulfin, a woman four years his senior who shared his political views.<ref name=mac3>Jordan (1993), p. 42.</ref> Bulfin was the daughter of the [[Irish nationalist]] publisher and travel-writer [[William Bulfin]].

Before returning to [[Dublin]] in 1927, where he became the IRA's Director of Intelligence, MacBride worked as a journalist in Paris and [[London]]. Soon after his return, he was arrested and charged with the murder of politician [[Kevin O'Higgins]], who had been assassinated near his home in [[Booterstown]], [[County Dublin]]. MacBride was able to prove, however, that he was on his way back to Ireland at the time, as he was able to call [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]]-turned-[[Cumann na nGaedheal]] politician [[Bryan Cooper (politician)|Bryan Cooper]], whom he had met on the boat travelling home, as a witness. He was then charged with being a subversive and interned in [[Mountjoy Prison]].<ref name=mac4>Jordan (1993), p. 47.</ref>

Towards the end of the 1920s, after many supporters had left to join [[Fianna Fáil]], some members of the IRA started pushing for a more left-wing agenda. After the [[IRA Army Council]] voted down the idea, MacBride launched a new movement, [[Saor Éire]] ("Free Ireland"), in 1931. Although it was a non-military organisation, Saor Éire was declared unlawful along with the IRA, [[Cumann na mBan]] and nine other bodies. MacBride, meanwhile, became the security services' number-one target.<ref name=mac5>Jordan (1993), p. 57.</ref>

In 1936, the IRA's [[chief of staff]] [[Moss (Maurice) Twomey|Moss Twomey]] was sent to prison for three years; he was replaced by MacBride. At the time, the movement was in a state of disarray, with conflicts between several factions and personalities. [[Tom Barry (Irish republican)|Tom Barry]] was appointed chief of staff to head up a military operation against the British, an action with which MacBride did not agree.<ref name= mac6>Jordan (1993), p. 70.</ref>

In 1937, MacBride was called to the [[Irish Bar|bar]]. He then resigned from the IRA when the [[Constitution of Ireland]] was enacted later that year. As a barrister, MacBride frequently defended IRA prisoners of the state, but was unsuccessful in stopping the execution in 1944 of [[Charlie Kerins]], convicted of killing [[Garda Síochána|Garda]] Detective [[Denis O'Brien (police officer)|Denis O'Brien]] in 1942. In 1946, during the inquest into the death of [[Seán McCaughey]], MacBride embarrassed the authorities by forcing them to admit that the conditions in [[Portlaoise Prison]] were inhumane.<ref name="IRA Documentary History">{{cite book |last=Hanley |first=Brian |year=2010 |page=122 |title=The IRA: A Documentary History 1916–2005 |location=Dublin |publisher=Gill & Macmillan |isbn=978-0717148134}}</ref>

== Clann na Poblachta ==
{{main|Clann na Poblachta}}
[[File:Seán MacBride circa 1947.jpg|thumb|left|MacBride circa 1947 when he founded Clann na Poblachta]]
In 1946, MacBride founded the republican/socialist party [[Clann na Poblachta]]. He hoped it would replace Fianna Fáil as Ireland's major political party. In October 1947, he won a seat in [[Dáil Éireann]] at a [[1947 Dublin County by-election|by-election]] in the [[Dublin County (Dáil constituency)|Dublin County]] constituency.<ref name=elecs_irl>{{cite web|url=http://www.electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=2263|title=Seán MacBride|work=ElectionsIreland.org|access-date=22 December 2009|archive-date=30 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130174445/http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=2263|url-status=live}}</ref> On the same day, [[Patrick Kinane]] also won the [[Tipperary (Dáil constituency)|Tipperary]] by-election for Clann na Poblachta.<ref name= mac7>Jordan (1993), pp. 86–98</ref>

However, at the [[1948 Irish general election|1948 general election]] Clann na Poblachta won only ten seats. The party joined with [[Fine Gael]], the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]], the [[National Labour Party (Ireland)|National Labour Party]], [[Clann na Talmhan]] and several independents to form the [[Government of the 13th Dáil|First Inter-Party Government]] with Fine Gael [[Teachta Dála|TD]] [[John A. Costello]] as [[Taoiseach]]. [[Richard Mulcahy]] was the [[Leader of Fine Gael]], but MacBride and many other Irish Republicans had never forgiven Mulcahy for his role in [[Executions during the Irish Civil War|carrying out 77 executions]] under the government of the [[Irish Free State]] in the 1920s during the [[Irish Civil War]]. To gain the support of Clann na Poblachta, Mulcahy stepped aside in favour of Costello. Two Clann na Poblachta TDs joined the cabinet; MacBride became [[Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade|Minister for External Affairs]]<ref name="Saturday Evening Post:1949" /> while [[Noël Browne]] became [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister for Health]].

On his ministerial accession, MacBride sent a [[Telegraphy|telegram]] to [[Pope Pius XII]] offering:
*"...to repose at the feet of Your Holiness the assurance of our filial loyalty and our devotion to Your August Person, as well as our firm resolve to be guided in all our work by the teaching of Christ and to strive for the attainment of a social order in Ireland based on Christian principles".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/religion-and-beliefs/previous-generations-would-be-astounded-at-attitudes-to-churches-in-ireland-today-1.2004480 | newspaper=Irish Times | date=18 November 2014 | first=Patrick | last=Semple | title=Previous generations would be astounded at attitudes to churches in Ireland today A 60-year journey from obsequious conformity | access-date=25 September 2018 | archive-date=27 October 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201027220724/https://www.irishtimes.com/news/social-affairs/religion-and-beliefs/previous-generations-would-be-astounded-at-attitudes-to-churches-in-ireland-today-1.2004480 | url-status=live }}</ref>

At MacBride's suggestion, Costello nominated the northern protestant [[Denis Ireland]] to the [[Seanad Eireann]],<ref name=oireachtas_db2>{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/members/member/Denis-L-Ireland.S.1950-06-16/|title=Denis Ireland|work=Oireachtas Members Database|access-date=15 July 2013|archive-date=7 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181107224843/https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/members/member/Denis-L-Ireland.S.1950-06-16|url-status=live}}</ref> the first resident of Northern Ireland to be appointed as a member of the [[Oireachtas]]. While a Senator (1948–1951), Ireland was Irish representative to the [[Council of Europe]] assisting MacBride in the leading role he was to play in securing acceptance of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]--signed in Rome on 4 November 1950.<ref>William Schabas (2012). "Ireland, The European Convention on Human Rights, and the Personal Contribution of Seán MacBride," in ''Judges, Transition, and Human Rights'', John Morison, Kieran McEvoy, and Gordon Anthony eds., Published to Oxford Scholarship Online: March 2012</ref> In 1950, MacBride was president of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Council of Europe, and he was vice-president of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|Organisation for European Economic Co-operation]] (OEEC, later OECD) in 1948–51. He was responsible for Ireland not joining the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO).<ref name= mac8>Jordan (1993), p. 115</ref>

He was instrumental in the repeal of the [[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936|External Relations Act]] and the passing of the [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|Republic of Ireland Act]] which came into force in 1949. It declared that Ireland may officially be described as the Republic of Ireland and that the [[President of Ireland]] had the executive authority of the state in its external relations. 

In 1951, MacBride controversially ordered Noël Browne to resign as a minister over the [[Mother and Child Scheme]] after it was attacked by the [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|Irish Catholic hierarchy]] and the Irish medical establishment.<ref name= mac9>Jordan (1993), pp. 125–140</ref> Whatever the merits of the scheme, or of Browne, MacBride concluded in a Cabinet memorandum:
:"Even if, as Catholics, we were prepared to take the responsibility of disregarding [the Hierarchy's] views, which I do not think we can do, it would be politically impossible to do so . . . We are dealing with the considered views of the leaders of the Catholic Church to which the vast majority of our people belong; these views cannot be ignored."<ref>Ronan Fanning (6 December 2009) [http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/the-age-of-our-craven-deference-is-finally-over-1965621.html The age of our craven deference is finally over] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023184943/http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/the-age-of-our-craven-deference-is-finally-over-1965621.html |date=23 October 2012 }}. The Independent.</ref>

Also in 1951, Clann na Poblachta was reduced to two seats after the general election. MacBride kept his seat and was re-elected again in 1954. Opposing the internment of IRA suspects during the [[Border Campaign (Irish Republican Army)|Border Campaign]] (1956–62), he contested both the [[1957 Irish general election|1957]] and [[1961 Irish general election|1961]] general elections but failed to be elected both times. He then retired from politics and continued practising as a barrister. He expressed an interest in running as an independent candidate for the [[1983 Irish presidential election]], but he did not receive sufficient backing and ultimately did not contest.

== International politics ==
[[File:Seán MacBride 1986.jpg|thumb|280px|Seán MacBride in 1986]]
In 1929 an Irish section of the [[League Against Imperialism]] was formed and MacBride served as its secretary.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wa5nAAAAMAAJ&q=sean+macbride+league+against+imperialism|title=Irish Historical Studies: Joint Journal of the Irish Historical Society and the Ulster Society for Irish Historical Studies|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert Dudley|last2=Moody|first2=Theodore William|date=2003|publisher=Hodges, Figgis & Company|language=en|access-date=25 September 2020|archive-date=26 July 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210726065620/https://books.google.com/books?id=Wa5nAAAAMAAJ&q=sean+macbride+league+against+imperialism|url-status=live}}</ref>

MacBride served as the International Chairman of [[Amnesty International]] from 1961 til 1975. He was Secretary-General of the [[International Commission of Jurists]] from 1963 to 1971. Following this, he was also elected Chair (1968–1974) and later President (1974–1985) of the [[International Peace Bureau]] in Geneva. He was Vice-President of the [[Organisation for European Economic Co-operation]] from 1948–51 and President of the Committee of Ministers of the [[Council of Europe]] in 1950. He was also involved in the International Prisoners of Conscience Fund and was appointed the International Commission for the Study of Communication Problems in 1977.<ref name= mac10>Jordan (1993), pp. 157–165</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sean-MacBride|title=Seán MacBride {{!}} Irish statesman|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2019-08-28|archive-date=29 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190629235541/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sean-MacBride|url-status=live}}</ref>

He drafted the constitution of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU); and also the first constitution of [[Ghana]] (the first UK African colony to achieve independence) which lasted for nine years until the coup of 1966.

In 1966, the US government reported that he had been involved with a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] funding operation.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2005-02-28|title=Peter Benenson|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/peter-benenson-13233.html|access-date=2020-10-24|website=The Independent|language=en|archive-date=30 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201030134615/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/peter-benenson-13233.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

MacBride was a signatory of the Convention for European Economic Co-operation, the Convention for the Protection of War Victims (1949) and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. He also played a part in drawing up the constitutions of [[Ghana]], [[Zambia]] and [[Tanzania]].<ref name="hi">{{Cite web|url=https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/sean-macbride-and-namibia/|title=Seán MacBride and Namibia|date=2013-02-21|website=History Ireland|access-date=2019-08-28|archive-date=19 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190819060809/https://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/sean-macbride-and-namibia/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Some of MacBride's appointments to the [[United Nations System]] included:
*[[Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations#Assistant Secretary-General|Assistant Secretary-General]]
*President of the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]]
*[[United Nations High Commissioner for Namibia|High Commissioner for Namibia]], in which capacity he created the [[United Nations Institute for Namibia]]<ref name=hi/> 
*President of [[UNESCO]]'s International Commission for the Study of Communications Problems, which produced the controversial 1980 [[MacBride report]].

== Human rights ==
Throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, MacBride worked for human rights worldwide. He took an Irish case to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] after hundreds of suspected [[Irish Republican Army (1922–1969)|IRA]] members were interned without trial in the Republic of Ireland in 1958. He was among a group of lawyers who founded [[JUSTICE]]—the UK-based human rights and law reform organisation—initially to monitor the [[show trials]] after the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Budapest uprising]], but which later became the UK section of the [[International Commission of Jurists]]. He was active in a number of international organisations concerned with human rights, among them the [[Prisoner of conscience|Prisoners of Conscience Appeal Fund]] (trustee).

In 1973, he was elected by the General Assembly to the post of High Commissioner for Namibia, with the rank of Assistant Secretary-General. The actions of his father John MacBride in leading the [[Irish Transvaal Brigade]] (known as MacBride's Brigade) for the [[Boer]]s against the [[British Army]], in the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]], gave Seán MacBride a unique access to [[History of South Africa in the Apartheid era|South Africa's apartheid government]]. In 1977, he was appointed president of the International Commission for the Study of Communication Problems, set up by UNESCO. In 1980 he was appointed Chairman of [[UNESCO]]. MacBride supported the [[Dunnes Stores Strike]] and attended at least one of their gatherings in May 1985.<ref name=hi/>

MacBride's work was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] (1974)<ref name="UN chronicle">United Nations Chronicle, Sep95, Vol. 32 Issue 3, p. 14, 2/5p, 1c; (AN 9511075547)</ref> as a man who "mobilised the conscience of the world in the fight against injustice". He later received the [[Lenin Peace Prize]] (1975–76) and the UNESCO Silver Medal for Service (1980). He received the Lenin Peace Prize for his opposition to what MacBride referred to as "this absolutely obscene arms race." He was one of only two to win both the Lenin and Nobel peace prizes, the other being [[Linus Pauling]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/16/obituaries/sean-macbride-of-ireland-is-dead-at-83.html|title=Sean MacBride of Ireland Is Dead at 83|last=Blair|first=William G.|date=1988-01-16|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-08-28|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=19 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190819111126/https://www.nytimes.com/1988/01/16/obituaries/sean-macbride-of-ireland-is-dead-at-83.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

During the 1980s, he initiated the Appeal by Lawyers against Nuclear War<ref>[http://i-p-o.org/na.htm Appeal by Lawyers against Nuclear War] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021063906/http://www.i-p-o.org/Na.htm |date=21 October 2006 }}. I-p-o.org. Retrieved 30 July 2012.</ref> which was jointly sponsored by the [[International Peace Bureau]] and the [[International Progress Organization]]. In close co-operation with [[Francis Boyle]] and [[Hans Köchler]] of the [[International Progress Organization]] he lobbied the General Assembly for a resolution demanding an Advisory Opinion from the [[International Court of Justice]] on the legality of nuclear arms. The Advisory Opinion on the [[Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice of 8 July 1996|''Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons'']] was eventually handed down by the ICJ in 1996.

In 1982, MacBride was chairman of the International Commission to enquire into reported violations of International Law by Israel during its invasion of the Lebanon. The other members were [[Richard Falk]], [[Kader Asmal]], Brian Bercusson, Géraud de la Pradelle, and Stefan Wild. The commission's report, which concluded that "the government of Israel has committed acts of aggression contrary to international law", was published in 1983 under the title ''Israel in Lebanon''.<ref>{{cite book|last=MacBride|first=Seán|author2=A.

He proposed a plan in 1984, known as the [[MacBride Principles]], which he argued would eliminate discrimination against [[Roman Catholics]] by employers in [[Northern Ireland]] and received widespread support for it in the United States and from [[Sinn Féin]]. However the MacBride Principles were criticised by the Irish and British Governments and most [[Northern Ireland]] parties, including the nationalist [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]] (SDLP), as unworkable and counterproductive.

He was also a keen [[pan-Celticism|pan-Celticist]].

==Later life and death==
In his later years, MacBride lived in his mother's home, Roebuck House, that served as a meeting place for many years for Irish nationalists, as well as in the Parisian [[arrondissement]] where he grew up with his mother, and enjoyed strolling along boyhood paths. While strolling through the [[Centre Pompidou|Centre Pompidou Museum]] in 1979, and happening upon an exhibit for Amnesty International, he whispered to a colleague "Amnesty, you know, was one of my children."{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}}

In 1978, he received the Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Golden Plate Awardees of the American Academy of Achievement|website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://achievement.org/our-history/golden-plate-awards/#public-service|access-date=4 November 2020|archive-date=15 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161215023909/https://achievement.org/our-history/golden-plate-awards/#public-service|url-status=live}}</ref>

Seán MacBride died in [[Dublin]] on 15 January 1988, eleven days before his 84th birthday. He is buried in [[Glasnevin Cemetery]] in a grave with his mother, and wife who died in 1976.

On the occasion of MacBride's death the [[African National Congress]] (ANC), [[Oliver Tambo]] stated "Seán MacBride will always be remembered for the concrete leadership he provided to the liberation movement and people of Namibia and South Africa. Driven by his own personal and political insight arising out of the cause of national freedom in Ireland . . . our debt to him can never be repaid."<ref name=hi/>
