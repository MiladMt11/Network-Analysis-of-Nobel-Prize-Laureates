== Early life ==
[[File:Savur3-pano cr.jpg|thumbnail|Savur district of [[Mardin Province]], Turkey]]
Aziz Sancar was born on 8 September 1946 to a lower middle class family in the [[Savur]] district of [[Mardin Province]], southeastern Turkey. He spoke [[Arabic]] with his parents, and Turkish with his siblings.<ref name=arf>{{cite news|title=Nobeli alan Prof. Aziz Sancar konuştu |trans-title=Nobel Prize winner Prof. Aziz Sancar speaks out |url=http://www.cnnturk.com/dunya/nobeli-alan-prof-aziz-sancar-konustu |publisher=[[CNN Türk]] |date=11 October 2015 |access-date=12 December 2015 |language=tr |quote=Anne babayla Arapça konuşurduk ama çocuklar kendi aramızda Türkçe konuşarak büyüdük.}} Translation: "We spoke in Arabic with our parents but as the children we grew up speaking in Turkish with one another."</ref><ref name=welle>{{cite news|title=Nobel Prize in Chemistry: how our DNA repairs itself|url=http://www.dw.com/en/nobel-prize-in-chemistry-how-our-dna-repairs-itself/a-18766543|agency=Deutsche Welle|date=7 October 2015}}</ref> His oldest brother Kenan Sancar is a retired [[brigadier general]] in the [[Turkish Armed Forces]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/aziz-sancar-i-emekli-general-agabeyi-anlatti-30264107|title=Aziz Sancar'ı, emekli general ağabeyi anlattı|website=Hurriyet.com.tr|access-date=3 December 2017}}</ref> He is the second cousin of the politician [[Mithat Sancar]], who was a member of parliament for Mardin from [[Peoples' Democratic Party (Turkey)|HDP]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Turkish-American scientist among winners of 2015 Nobel Prize in Chemistry |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/world_turkish-american-scientist-among-winners-of-2015-nobel-prize-in-chemistry_400839.html |publisher=[[Today's Zaman]] |access-date=12 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151011005639/http://www.todayszaman.com/world_turkish-american-scientist-among-winners-of-2015-nobel-prize-in-chemistry_400839.html |archive-date=October 11, 2015 }}</ref> He was the seventh of eight children.<ref name="h1"/>

Throughout his school life, Sancar had great academic success that was noted by his teachers. He wanted to study chemistry whilst at high school, but was persuaded to study medicine after five of his classmates also got into medicine along with him. As such, he studied medicine at the Faculty of Medicine of [[Istanbul University]].<ref name=arf/>

== Education ==
[[File:Istanbul Tip Fakultesi 03.jpg|thumbnail|Istanbul University - Faculty of Medicine]]
Sancar received his primary education near his hometown of [[Savur]].<ref name=t2424 /> He then completed his [[Doctor of Medicine|MD]] degree in [[Istanbul University]] of Turkey in 1969 and completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree on the photoreactivating enzyme of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' in 1977 at the [[University of Texas at Dallas]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Aziz Sancar |url=http://www.med.unc.edu/biochem/people/faculty/primary/asancar |publisher=[[UNC School of Medicine]] |access-date=2015-10-07}}</ref> in the laboratory of Claud Stan Rupert,<ref name="thesis-sancar-1977">{{cite thesis |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/302873229/ |title=A study on photoreactivating enzyme (DNA photolyase) of Escherichia coli |date=1977 |publisher=[[University of Texas at Dallas]] |degree=Ph.D. |last=Sancar |first=Aziz |via=[[ProQuest]] |url-access=subscription |oclc=4432179}}</ref> now Professor Emeritus.

== Career ==
Aziz Sancar is an honorary member of the [[Turkish Academy of Sciences]]<ref name=tubahon>{{cite web|title=Prof. Dr. Aziz Sancar|url=http://www.tuba.gov.tr/member/tuba-seref-uyeleri/id/22/mid/61/lang/eng/|publisher=Turkish Academy of Sciences|access-date=9 October 2015}}</ref> and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref name=amacad>{{cite web|title=American Academy Announces 2004 Fellows and Foreign Honorary Members|url=https://www.amacad.org/content/news/pressReleases.aspx?pr=59|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=9 October 2015}}</ref>

After graduating from Istanbul University, Sancar returned to Savur. Although he wanted to go to the United States, he was recommended to try out being a doctor and he worked as a doctor in the region for 1.5 years. He then won a scholarship from [[TÜBİTAK]] to pursue further education in biochemistry at [[Johns Hopkins University]], but returned to Savur in 1973 as a doctor after spending 1.5 years there due to having social difficulties and inability to adapt to the American way of life. He only spoke French when he arrived in the US but learned English during his education at Johns Hopkins.<ref name=arf/>

Soon after, he wrote to Rupert, who had been involved in the discovery of DNA repair and was at Johns Hopkins during Sancar's time there but had since moved to the [[University of Texas at Dallas]]. He was accepted and completed his PhD in molecular biology there.<ref name=arf/> His interest had been stimulated by the recovery of bacteria, which had been exposed to deadly amounts of ultraviolet radiation, upon their illumination with blue light. In 1976, as part of his doctoral dissertation, he managed to replicate the gene for [[photolyase]], an enzyme that repairs [[thymine dimer]]s that result from ultraviolet damage.<ref name="nobelbio">{{cite web|title=DNA repair – providing chemical stability for life|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2015/popular-chemistryprize2015.pdf|publisher=Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences|access-date=10 March 2017}}</ref>

After completing his PhD, Sancar had three rejected applications for postdoctoral positions and then took up work at [[Yale University]] as a laboratory technician.<ref name="nobelbio"/> He worked at Yale for five years. Here, he started his field-changing work on [[nucleotide excision repair]], another DNA mechanism that works in the dark. He elucidated the molecular details of this process, identifying [[uvrABC endonuclease]] and the genes that code for it, and furthermore discovering that these enzymes cut twice on the damaged strand of DNA, removing 12-13 [[nucleotide]]s that include the damaged part.<ref name="nobelbio"/>

Following his mechanistic elucidations of nucleotide exchange repair, he was accepted as a lecturer at the University of North Carolina, the only university that he got a positive response from out of the 50 he applied to. He has stated that his accent of English was detrimental to his career as a lecturer.<ref name=arf/> At Chapel Hill, Sancar discovered the following steps of nucleotide excision repair in bacteria and worked on the more complex version of this repair mechanism in humans.<ref name="nobelbio"/>

His longest-running study has involved photolyase and the mechanisms of photo-reactivation. In his inaugural article in the PNAS, Sancar captured the photolyase radicals he has chased for nearly 20 years, thus providing direct observation of the photocycle for thymine dimer repair.<ref name=Zagorski>{{cite journal

He is married to Gwen Boles Sancar, who graduated the same year and who is also a Professor of Biochemistry and [[Biophysics]] at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utdallas.edu/biology/news/2005/aziz.html|title=Biology : Aziz Sancar elected to the National Academy of Sciences|work=utdallas.edu|access-date=7 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194151/http://www.utdallas.edu/biology/news/2005/aziz.html|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Together, they founded Carolina Türk Evi, a permanent Turkish Center in close proximity to the campus of UNC-CH, which provides graduate housing for four Turkish researchers at UNC-CH, short term guest services for Turkish visiting scholars, and a center for promoting Turkish-American interchange.<ref name="CarolinaTürkEvi"/>

==Research on circadian clock==

{{Main|Circadian clock}}
Sancar and his research team have discovered that two genes, ''[[Period (gene)|Period]]'' and ''[[Cryptochrome]]'', keep the circadian clocks of all human cells in proper rhythm, syncing them to the 24 hours of the day and seasons.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ye|first1=Rui|last2=Selby|first2=Cristopher P.|last3=Chiou|first3=Yi-Ying|last4=Ozkan-Dagliyan|first4=Irem|last5=Gaddameedhi|first5=Shobhan|last6=Sancar|first6=Aziz|title=Dual modes of CLOCK:BMAL1 inhibition mediated by Cryptochrome and Period proteins in the mammalian circadian clock|journal=Genes & Development|date=15 September 2014|volume=28|issue=18|pages=1989–1998|doi=10.1101/gad.249417.114|pmid=25228643|ref=geneDev|issn=1549-5477|pmc=4173159}}</ref> Their findings were published in the [[Genes and Development]] journal in September 16, 2014. Sancar's research has provided a complete understanding of the workings of Circadian clocks in humans, which may be used to treat a wide range of different illnesses and disorders such as [[jet-lag]] and [[seasonal affective disorder]], and may be useful in controlling and optimizing various cancer treatments.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Derewicz|first1=Mark|title=Sancar lab finds final pieces to the circadian clock puzzle|url=https://www.med.unc.edu/biochem/news/sancar-lab-circadian-clock-puzzle|website=UNC SCHOOL of MEDICINE|date=16 September 2014|publisher=The University of North Carolina|access-date=19 April 2016|ref=circadian}}</ref>
