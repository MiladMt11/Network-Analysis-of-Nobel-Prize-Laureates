'''Elizabeth Williams''' ({{nee}} '''Smyth''';<ref>[https://alphahistory.com/northernireland/betty-williams/  "Betty Williams", ''AlphaHistory.com'']. Retrieved 18 March 2020</ref> 22 May 1943 &ndash; 17 March 2020) was a peace activist from Northern Ireland. She was a co-recipient with [[Mairead Corrigan]] of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1976 for her work as a cofounder of '''Community of Peace People''', an organisation dedicated to promoting a peaceful resolution to [[the Troubles]] in Northern Ireland.<ref name="Guardian"/>

Williams headed the Global Children's Foundation and was the President of the World Centre of Compassion for Children International. She was also the Chair of Institute for Asian Democracy in Washington D.C.<ref name="nobel"/> She lectured widely on topics of peace, education, inter-cultural and inter-faith understanding, anti-extremism, and [[children's rights]].

Williams was a founding member of the Nobel Laureate Summit, which has taken place annually since 2000.<ref>{{cite news |title=14th Nobel Peace Laureate Summit takes place in Rome |url=http://www.aa.com.tr/en/news/434728--14th-nobel-peace-laureate-summit-takes-place-in-rome  |newspaper=Anadolu |publisher=AA |date=12 December 2014 |access-date=1 January 2015}}</ref>

In 2006, Williams became a founder of the [[Nobel Women's Initiative]] along with Nobel Peace Laureates [[Mairead Corrigan Maguire]], [[Shirin Ebadi]], [[Wangari Maathai]], [[Jody Williams]] and [[Rigoberta Menchú Tum]]. These six women, representing North and South America, the Middle East, Europe and Africa, brought together their experiences in a united effort for peace with justice and equality.<ref name="Klenke2011">{{cite book|author=Karin Klenke|title=Women in Leadership: Contextual Dynamics and Boundaries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJ16kb4sgS8C&pg=PA231|access-date=15 January 2012|date=27 April 2011|publisher=Emerald Group Publishing|isbn=978-0-85724-561-8|page=231}}</ref> It is the goal of the Nobel Women's Initiative to help strengthen work being done in support of [[women's rights]] around the world.

==Early life==
Williams was born on 22 May 1943 in [[Belfast]], Northern Ireland. Her father worked as a butcher and her mother was a housewife. Betty received her primary education from St. Teresa Primary School in Belfast and attended [[St Dominic's Grammar School for Girls]] for her secondary school studies. Upon completing her formal education, she took up a job of office receptionist.<ref name="nobel">{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1976/williams-facts.html |title=Betty Williams |website=NobelPrize.org |access-date=1 January 2015}}</ref><ref name="Guardian"/>

Rare for the time in Northern Ireland, her father was Protestant and her mother was Catholic; a family background from which Williams later said she derived religious tolerance and a breadth of vision that motivated her to work for peace.<ref name="Guardian"/> Early in the 1970s she joined an anti-violence campaign headed by a Protestant priest. Williams credited this experience for preparing her to eventually found her own peace movement, which focused on creating peace groups composed of former opponents, practicing confidence-building measures, and the development of a grassroots peace process.<ref name="nobel"/>

Williams was drawn into the public arena after witnessing the death of three children on 10 August 1976, when they were hit by a car whose driver, an [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) paramilitary named Danny Lennon, had been fatally shot in return fire by a soldier of the Kings Own Royal Border regiment.<ref name="BBC">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/northern_ireland/7937484.stm|title=Troubles became rallying cry|date=11 March 2009|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}{{cite web |url=http://www.peaceproposal.com/Betty1.html |title='Each Child Belongs to Us': A New way forward for children of the world |first=Betty |last=Williams |publisher=Peace Proposal |access-date=23 February 2011 |quote=Provisional I.R.A., on a mission to kill British soldiers, opened fire from the back of a speeding car on an Army foot patrol.

Their mother, Anne Maguire, who was with the children, eventually took her own life in January 1980.<ref name="telegraph-obit">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2020/03/19/betty-williams-winner-nobel-peace-prize-work-northern-ireland/ |title=Betty Williams, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize for her work in Northern Ireland – obituary |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=19 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200319232114/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2020/03/19/betty-williams-winner-nobel-peace-prize-work-northern-ireland/ |archive-date=19 March 2020 |url-status=live|last1=Obituaries |first1=Telegraph }}</ref>

Williams was so moved by the incident that within two days of the tragic event, she had obtained 6,000 signatures on a [[petition]] for peace and gained wide media attention. With Corrigan, she co-founded the Women for Peace; which, with [[Ciaran McKeown]], later became the '''Community of Peace People'''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Badge |first=Peter |editor-last=Turner |editor-first=Nikolaus |title=Nobel Faces: A Gallery of Nobel Prize Winners |url=https://archive.org/details/nobelfacesgaller00badg |url-access=registration |access-date=9 March 2011 |year=2008 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |location=[[Weinheim]] |isbn=978-3-527-40678-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/nobelfacesgaller00badg/page/474 474]}}</ref>

Williams soon organised a peace march to the graves of the slain children, which was attended by 10,000 Protestant and Catholic women. However, the peaceful march was violently disrupted by members of the IRA, who accused them of being "dupes of the British".<ref name="virginia.edu">[http://www.virginia.edu/nobel/laureates/bios/williams_bio.html Nobel Peace Laureates Conference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916222735/http://www.virginia.edu/nobel/laureates/bios/williams_bio.html |date=16 September 2011 }}</ref> The following week, Williams led another march in [[Ormeau Park]] that concluded successfully without incident – this time with 20,000 participants.<ref name="telegraph-obit"/>

At that time, Williams declared the following:<ref name="telegraph-obit"/>

===Declaration of the Peace People===
First Declaration of the Peace People
*We have a simple message to the world from this movement for Peace.
*We want to live and love and build a just and peaceful society.
*We want for our children, as we want for ourselves, our lives at home, at work, and at play to be lives of joy and Peace.
*We recognise that to build such a society demands dedication, hard work, and courage.
*We recognise that there are many problems in our society which are a source of conflict and violence.
*We recognise that every bullet fired and every exploding bomb make that work more difficult.
*We reject the use of the bomb and the bullet and all the techniques of violence.
*We dedicate ourselves to working with our neighbours, near and far, day in and day out, to build that peaceful society in which the tragedies we have known are a bad memory and a continuing warning.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peacepeople.com/PPDeclaration.htm|title=The Peace People Declaration<!-- Bot generated title -->|access-date=2 August 2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050909210229/http://www.peacepeople.com/PPDeclaration.htm|archive-date=9 September 2005|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Nobel Peace Prize==
[[File:Betty Williams.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Williams around the time she received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]]]
In recognition of her efforts for peace, Williams, together with her friend [[Mairead Corrigan]], became joint recipients of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1977 (the prize for 1976). In her acceptance speech, Williams said, <blockquote>That first week will always be remembered of course for something else besides the birth of the Peace People. For those most closely involved, the most powerful memory of that week was the death of a young republican and the deaths of three children struck by the dead man's car. A deep sense of frustration at the mindless stupidity of the continuing violence was already evident before the tragic events of that sunny afternoon of 10 August 1976. But the deaths of those four young people in one terrible moment of violence caused that frustration to explode, and create the possibility of a real peace movement...As far as we are concerned, every single death in the last eight years, and every death in every war that was ever fought represents life needlessly wasted, a mother's labour spurned.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gos.sbc.edu/w/bwilliams.html|title=Gifts of Speech – Betty Williams|website=gos.sbc.edu}}</ref></blockquote>

The Peace Prize money was divided equally between Williams and Corrigan.  Williams kept her share of the money, stating that her intention was to use it to promote peace beyond Ireland, but faced criticism for her decision.<ref name="Guardian"/> She and Corrigan had no contact after 1976.<ref name="Guardian"/>  In 1978 Williams broke off links with the Peace People movement, and became instead an activist for peace in other areas around the world.<ref name="Guardian"/>

==Other awards==
Williams received the [[People's Peace Prize of Norway]] in 1976, the Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]] in 1977,<ref>{{cite web|title= Golden Plate Awardees of the American Academy of Achievement |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url= https://achievement.org/our-history/golden-plate-awards/#public-service}}</ref> the [[Schweitzer Medallion for Courage]], the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Award]], the [[Eleanor Roosevelt Award]] in 1984, and the [[Frank Foundation Child Care International Oliver Award]]. In 1995, she was awarded the Rotary Club International "Paul Harris Fellowship" and the Together for Peace Building Award.<ref name="nobel"/>

==Talks and guest lectures==
[[File:Betty Williams, Women's World Awards 2009 c.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Williams in March 2009]]
At the 2006 Earth Dialogues forum in [[Brisbane]], Williams told an audience of schoolchildren during a speech on Iraq War casualties that "Right now, I would like to kill George W. Bush."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/nobel-peace-laureate-i-wo_n_25717|title=Nobel Peace Laureate: "I Would Love To Kill George Bush"...|last=McDonald|first=Annabelle|publisher=[[The Australian]]|work=[[HuffPost]]|date=28 March 2008|access-date=24 February 2020}}</ref> From 17 to 20 September 2007, Williams gave a series of lectures in Southern California: on 18 September, she presented a lecture to the academic community of Orange County entitled "Peace in the World Is Everybody's Business"; and on 20 September she gave a lecture to 2,232 members of the general public, including 1,100 high school sophomores, at [[Soka University of America]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.soka.edu/about/our-stories/peace-world-everybodys-business-betty-williams|title="Peace in the World is Everybody's Business" by Betty Williams|publisher=[[Soka University of America]]|date=20 September 2007|access-date=24 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200224090234/https://www.soka.edu/about/our-stories/peace-world-everybodys-business-betty-williams |archive-date=24 February 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2010, she gave a lecture at [[WE Day]] Toronto, a [[WE Charity]] event that empowers students to be active within their communities, and worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://toronto.ctvnews.ca/students-gather-at-acc-for-we-day-celebration-1.558391|title=Students gather at ACC for 'We Day' celebration|publisher=[[CTV News]]|date=30 September 2010|access-date=24 February 2020}}</ref>

Speaking at the [[University of Bradford]] before an audience of 200 in March 2011, Williams warned that young Muslim women on campus were vulnerable to attacks from angry family members, while the university does little to help protect them. "If you had someone on this campus these young women could go to say, 'I am frightened' – if you are not doing that here, you are dehumanising them by not helping these young women, don't you think?"<ref>{{cite news |title=Bradford University is told it must do more to stop attacks on the vulnerable Muslim women |first=Jim |last=Greenhalf |url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/local/localbrad/8891679.Nobel_prize_winner_s_appeal_to_protect_Muslim_women_in_Bradford/ |newspaper=[[Telegraph & Argus]] |publisher=[[Newsquest]] |date=4 March 2011 |access-date=10 March 2011}}</ref>
