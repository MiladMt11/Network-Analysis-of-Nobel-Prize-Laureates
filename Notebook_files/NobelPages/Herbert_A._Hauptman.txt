Today, Hauptman's [[direct methods (crystallography)|direct methods]], which he continued to improve and refine, are routinely used to solve complicated structures. It was the application of this mathematical method to a wide variety of chemical structures that led the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] to name Hauptman and [[Jerome Karle]] recipients of the 1985 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].

==Life==
He was born in to a Jewish family in [[New York City]], the oldest child of Leah (Rosenfeld) and Israel Hauptman.<ref name="Jewish virtual library">{{cite web |website=[[Jewish virtual library]]|url= https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/hauptman1.html/|title=Herbert Hauptman |access-date=November 8, 2013}}</ref> He was married to Edith Citrynell since November 10, 1940, with two daughters, Barbara (1947) and Carol (1950).

He was interested in [[science]] and mathematics from an early age which he pursued{{how|date=January 2020}} at [[Townsend Harris High School]], graduated from the [[City College of New York]] (1937) and obtained an M.A. degree in mathematics from [[Columbia University]] in 1939.

After the war he started a collaboration with [[Jerome Karle]] at the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and at the same time enrolled in the [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] program at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. He received his Ph.D. from the [[University of Maryland]] in 1955 in physics, which is part of the [[University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web |date=2020 |title=Herbert A.

By 1955 he had received his Ph.D. in mathematics, and they had laid the foundations of the [[direct methods (crystallography)|direct methods]] in X-ray crystallography. Their 1953 monograph, "Solution of the Phase Problem I. The Centrosymmetric Crystal", contained the main ideas, the most important of which was the introduction of [[probabilistic]] methods through a development of the [[Sayre equation]].

In 1970 he joined the crystallographic group of the [[Medical Foundation of Buffalo]] of which he was Research Director in 1972. During the early years of this period he formulated the neighborhood principle and extension concept. These theories were further developed during the following decades.

In 2003, as an [[atheist]]<ref>"Outside the field of scientific research, he was known for his outspoken atheism: belief in God, he once declared, is not only incompatible with good science, but is "damaging to the wellbeing of the human race."

==Works==
Hauptman has authored over 170 publications, including journal articles, research papers, chapters and books. In 1970, Hauptman joined the crystallographic group of the [[Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute]] (formerly the Medical Foundation of Buffalo) of which he became Research Director in 1972. Until his death, he served as President of the [[Hauptman-Woodward Medical Research Institute]] as well as Research Professor in the Department of Biophysical Sciences and Adjunct Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University at Buffalo]]. Prior to coming to Buffalo, he worked as a mathematician and supervisor in various departments at the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] from 1947. He received his B.S. from [[City College of New York]], M.S. from [[Columbia University]] and Ph.D. from the [[University of Maryland, College Park]].
