'''Carl Friedrich Georg Spitteler''' (24 April 1845 – 29 December 1924) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] poet who was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1919 "in special appreciation of his [[epic poetry|epic]], ''Olympian Spring''". His work includes both [[pessimism|pessimistic]] and [[hero]]ic poems.

==Biography==
Spitteler was born in [[Liestal]]. His father was an official of the government, being Federal Secretary of the Treasury from 1849–56. Young Spitteler attended the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] at [[Basel]], having among his teachers philologist [[Wilhelm Wackernagel]] and historian [[Jakob Burckhardt]]. From 1863 he studied law at the [[University of Zurich]]. In 1865–1870 he studied theology in the same institution, at [[Heidelberg]] and [[Basel]], though when a position as pastor was offered him, he felt that he must decline it. He had begun to realize his mission as an epic poet and therefore refused to work in the field for which he had prepared himself.<ref name=ea>{{Americana|wstitle=Spitteler, Carl|author=William F. Hauhart|inline=1}}</ref>

Later he worked in [[Russia]] as tutor, starting from August 1871, remaining there (with some periods in [[Finland]]) until 1879. Later he was elementary teacher in [[Bern]] and [[La Neuveville]], as well as journalist for the ''Der Kunstwart'' and as editor for the ''[[Neue Zürcher Zeitung]]''. In 1883 Spitteler married Marie op der Hoff, previously his pupil in Neuveville.

In 1881 Spitteler published the allegoric prose poem ''Prometheus and Epimetheus'', published under the pseudonym '''Carl Felix Tandem''', and showing contrasts between ideals and dogmas through the two mythological figures of the titles. This 1881 edition was given an extended psychological exegesis by [[Carl Gustav Jung]] in his book ''[[Psychological Types]]'' (published in 1921). Late in life, Spitteler reworked ''Prometheus and Epimetheus'' and published it under his true name, with the new title ''Prometheus der Dulder'' (''Prometheus the Sufferer'', 1924).

In 1882 he published his ''Extramundana'', a collection of poems. He gave up teaching in 1885 and devoted himself to a journalistic career in Basel. Now his works began to come in rapid succession. In 1891 there appeared ''Friedli, der Kalderi'', a collection of short stories, in which Spitteler, as he himself says, depicted Russian realism. ''Literarische Gleichnisse'' appeared in 1892, and ''Balladen'' in 1896.<ref name=ea/>

In 1900–1905 Spitteler wrote the powerful allegoric-epic poem, in [[iambic hexameter]]s, ''Olympischer Frühling'' (''Olympic Spring''). This work, mixing fantastic, naturalistic, religions and mythological themes, deals with human concern towards the universe. His prose works include ''Die Mädchenfeinde ''(''Two Little Misogynists'', 1907), about his autobiographical childhood experiences, the dramatic ''Conrad der Leutnant ''(1898), in which he show influence from the previously opposed Naturalism, and the autobiographical novella ''Imago'' (1906), examining the role of the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] in the conflict between a creative mind and the middle-class restrictions with [[internal monologue]].

During [[World War I]] he opposed the pro-German attitude of the Swiss German-speaking majority, a position put forward in the essay "Unser Schweizer Standpunkt". In 1919 he won the Nobel Prize. Spitteler died at [[Lucerne]] in 1924.

Carl Spitteler's estate is archived in the [[Swiss Literary Archives]] in [[Bern]], in the [[Zentralbibliothek Zürich|Zürich Central Library]] and in the [[Dichtermuseum Liestal|Dichter- und Stadtmuseum]] in Liestal.

==Pop Culture==
[[Carl Jung]] claimed his idea of the archetype of the [[Anima and animus|Anima]] was based upon what Spitteler described as 'My Lady Soul'.  Musician [[David Bowie]], who famously described himself as Jungian, wrote a song in 1973 entitled "[[Lady Grinning Soul]]".<ref>[https://tanjastark.com/2015/06/22/crashing-out-with-sylvian-david-bowie-carl-jung-and-the-unconscious/ Stark, T., “Crashing Out with Sylvian: David Bowie, Carl Jung and the Unconscious” in Deveroux, E., M.Power and A.
