'''Ernst Otto Fischer''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɛʁnst ˌɔto ˈfɪʃɐ|-|De-Ernst Otto Fischer.ogg}}; 10 November 1918 – 23 July 2007) was a German chemist who won the Nobel Prize for pioneering work in the area of [[organometallic chemistry]].

==Early life==
He was born in [[Solln]], near [[Munich]]. His parents were Karl T. Fischer, Professor of Physics at the [[Technical University of Munich]] (TU), and Valentine née Danzer. He graduated in 1937 with ''Abitur''.  Before the completion of two years' [[compulsory military service]], the [[Second World War]] broke out, and he served in Poland, France, and Russia. During a period of study leave, towards the end of 1941 he began to study chemistry at the [[Technical University of Munich]]. Following the end of the War, he was released by the Americans in the autumn of 1945 and resumed his studies.

==Training==
Fischer graduated from TUM in 1949. He then started his doctoral thesis as an assistant to Professor [[Walter Hieber]] in the [[Inorganic chemistry|Inorganic Chemistry]] Institute,  His thesis was entitled "The Mechanisms of Carbon Monoxide Reactions of Nickel(II) Salts in the Presence of Dithionites and Sulfoxylates".<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Hieber, W. |author2=Fischer, E.

==Research career==
After receiving his doctorate in 1952, he remained at TU.  He continued his research on the [[organometallic chemistry]] of the [[transition metal]]. He almost immediately challenged the structure for ferrocene as postulated by Pauson and Keally.<ref>{{cite journal | author=E. O. Fischer | title=Metallverbindungen des Cyclopentadiens und des Indens | journal=Angewandte Chemie | year=1955 | volume=67 | issue=7 | pages=211 | doi=10.1002/ange.19550670708}}</ref> Shortly thereafter, he published the structural data of [[ferrocene]] and the new complexes [[nickelocene]] and  [[cobaltocene]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=E.

B | year=1952 | volume=7 | pages=377–379 | doi=10.1515/znb-1952-0701| doi-access=free }}</ref>  Near the same time, he focused also on the then baffling chemistry resulting from Hein's reactions of chromium(III) chloride with [[phenylmagnesium bromide]].  This effort resulted in his isolation of [[bis(benzene)chromium]], foretelling an entirely new class of sandwich complexes.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Seyferth, D. | title = Bis(benzene)chromium. 1.

==Profesional advances and recognition==
He was appointed a lecturer at the TU in 1955 and, in 1957, professor and then, in 1959, C4 professor.  In 1964 he took the Chair of Inorganic Chemistry at the TU.

In 1964, he was elected a member of the Mathematics/Natural Science section of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences. In 1969 he was appointed a member of the [[German Academy of Natural Scientists Leopoldina|German Academy of Natural Scientists, Leopoldina]] and in 1972 was given an honorary doctorate by the Faculty of Chemistry and Pharmacy of the University of Munich.

He lectured across the world on metal complexes of [[cyclopentadienyl]], indenyl, arenes, olefins, and metal carbonyls. In the 1960s his group discovered a metal alkylidene and alkylidyne complexes, since referred to as [[Fischer carbene]]s and Fischer-[[carbyne]]s.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Fischer |first=E. O. |title=On the way to carbene and carbyne complexes |journal=Advances in Organometallic Chemistry |year=1976 |volume=14 |pages=1–32 |doi=10.1016/S0065-3055(08)60647-4 |isbn=9780120311149 }}</ref>  Overall he published about 450 journal articles and he trained many PhD and postdoctoral students, many of whom went on to noteworthy careers.  Among his many foreign lectureships, he was Firestone Lecturer at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] (1969), visiting professor at the [[University of Florida]] (1971), and [[Arthur D. Little]] visiting professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (1973).

He has received many awards including, in 1973 with [[Geoffrey Wilkinson]], the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his work on [[organometallic compound]]s.

==Death==

He died on 23 July 2007 in Munich.<ref>[http://derstandard.at/?url=/?id=2972542 derStandard.at<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> At the time of his death, Fischer was the oldest living German Nobel laureate. He was succeeded by [[Manfred Eigen]], who shared the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1967 and is nine years younger than Fischer was.
