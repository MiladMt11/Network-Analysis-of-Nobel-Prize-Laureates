'''Arno Allan Penzias''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɛ|n|z|i|ə|s}}; born April 26, 1933) is an [[United States|American]] [[physicist]], [[radio astronomer]] and [[Nobel laureate]] in [[Nobel Prize in physics|physics]]. Along with [[Robert Woodrow Wilson]], he discovered the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]], which helped establish the [[Big Bang]] theory of cosmology.

==Early life and education==
Penzias was born in [[Munich]], [[Germany]], the son of Justine (née Eisenreich) and Karl Penzias, who ran a leather business.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=SqkRAQAAMAAJ&q=Arno+Allan+Penzias+munich&dq=Arno+Allan+Penzias+munich&source=bl&ots=8znZUvcQvp&sig=larOwftfHVnp9FZ5QCPJQlaf1H0&hl=en&redir_esc=y Notable Twentieth-century Scientists: L-R]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/dictionary/famous-scientists/physicists/arno-allan-penzias-info.htm |title=Arno Allan Penzias |publisher=[[HowStuffWorks]] |access-date=26 November 2013|date=July 2010 }}</ref> His grandparents had come to Munich from Poland and were among the leaders of the Reichenbach Strasse Shul. At age six, he and his brother Gunther were among the [[Jews in Germany|Jewish]] children evacuated to [[United Kingdom|Britain]] as part of the [[Kindertransport]] rescue operation.  Some time later,<ref name="Nobel">{{Nobelprize}} including the Nobel Lecture, December 8, 1978 ''The Origin of Elements''</ref> his parents also fled [[Nazi Germany]] for the [[United States|U.S.]], and the family settled in the [[Garment District, Manhattan|Garment District]] of [[New York City]] in 1940. In 1946, Penzias became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the [[United States]]. He graduated from [[Brooklyn Technical High School]] in 1951<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bths.edu/apps/pages/index.jsp?uREC_ID=228863&type=d&termREC_ID=&pREC_ID=443924 |title=BTHS.com|publisher=Brooklyn Technical High School |access-date=18 March 2014}}</ref> and after enrolling to study chemistry at the [[City College of New York]], he changed majors and graduated 1954 with a degree in physics, ranked near the top of his class.

Following graduation, Penzias served for two years as a [[radar]] officer in the U.S. Army Signal Corps. This led to a research assistantship in the [[Columbia University]] Radiation Laboratory, which was then heavily involved in microwave physics. Penzias worked under [[Charles Townes]], who later invented the [[maser]].

Next, Penzias enrolled as a graduate student at Columbia in 1956. He earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in physics from Columbia University in 1962.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Arno_Allan_Penzias |title=Arno Allan Penzias |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |access-date=10 August 2011}}</ref>

==Career==
[[File:Horn Antenna-in Holmdel, New Jersey - restoration1.jpg|thumb|left|Penzias and Wilson stand at the 15 meter [[Holmdel Horn Antenna]] that brought their most notable discovery.]]
Penzias went on to work at [[Bell Labs]] in [[Holmdel, New Jersey]], where, with Robert Woodrow Wilson, he worked on ultra-sensitive cryogenic [[microwave]] receivers, intended for radio astronomy observations.  In 1964, on building their most sensitive [[Holmdel Horn Antenna|antenna/receiver system]], the pair encountered radio noise which they could not explain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.physics.org/featuredetail.asp?id=71 |title=Nobel-prize winning accidents |author=www.physics.org |access-date=24 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203162043/http://www.physics.org/featuredetail.asp?id=71 |archive-date=3 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was far less energetic than the radiation given off by the [[Milky Way]], and it was [[isotropic]], so they assumed their instrument was subject to interference by terrestrial sources.  They tried, and then rejected, the hypothesis that the radio noise emanated from New York City.  An examination of the microwave [[horn antenna]] showed it was full of bat and pigeon droppings (which Penzias described as "white [[dielectric]] material").  After the pair removed the dung buildup the noise remained.  Having rejected all sources of interference, Penzias contacted [[Robert Dicke]], who suggested it might be the background radiation predicted by some cosmological theories. The pair agreed with Dicke to publish side-by-side letters in the Astrophysical Journal, with Penzias and Wilson describing their observations<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Penzias|first1 = A.A.|last2 = Wilson|first2=R.W.|title=A Measurement of Excess Antenna Temperature at 4080 Mc/s|journal=[[Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=142|pages=419–421|date=1965|doi=10.1086/148307|bibcode=1965ApJ...142..419P}}</ref> and Dicke suggesting the interpretation as the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMB), the radio remnant of the [[Big Bang]].<ref name="Nobel"/><ref>{{cite news |last=Lehrer |first=Jonah |url=https://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/12/fail_accept_defeat/all/ |title=The Neuroscience of Screwing up |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=21 December 2009 |access-date=21 December 2009| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091229035926/http://www.wired.com/magazine/2009/12/fail_accept_defeat/| archive-date= 29 December 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> This allowed astronomers to confirm the Big Bang, and to correct many of their previous assumptions about it.

He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] and the National Academy of Sciences in 1975.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter P|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterP.pdf|publisher=[[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]|access-date=7 April 2011| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110515183157/http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterP.pdf| archive-date= 15 May 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/members/51742.html | title=Arno Penzias}}</ref> Penzias and Wilson received the 1978 Nobel Prize, sharing it with [[Pyotr Leonidovich Kapitsa]] (Kapitsa's work on [[Low-temperature physics]] was unrelated to Penzias and Wilson's).  In 1977, the two had received the [[Henry Draper Medal]] of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].<ref name=Draper>{{cite web|title=Henry Draper Medal |url=http://www.nasonline.org/about-nas/awards/henry-draper-medal.html |publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]] |access-date=24 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126003930/http://www.nasonline.org/about-nas/awards/henry-draper-medal.html |archive-date=26 January 2013 }}</ref> In 1979, Penzias received the Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Golden Plate Awardees of the American Academy of Achievement |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://achievement.org/our-history/golden-plate-awards/#science-exploration}}</ref> He is also the recipient of The International Center in New York's Award of Excellence. In 1998, he was awarded the [[IRI Medal]] from the [[Industrial Research Institute]].

On April 26, 2019 the Nürnberger Astronomische Gesellschaft e.V. (NAG) inaugurated the 3-m [[radio telescope]] at the Regiomontanus-Sternwarte, the [[public observatory]] of [[Nuremberg]], and dedicated this instrument to Arno Penzias.

Penzias has been a resident of [[Highland Park, New Jersey]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Horner |first=Shirley |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5DD1031F930A35753C1A965958260 |title=About Books |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=3 October 1993 |access-date=23 October 2009}}</ref> He has a son, David, and two daughters, Mindy Penzias Dirks, PhD, and Rabbi Shifra (Laurie) Weiss-Penzias.<ref>B Schlessinger, Bernard S. and June H., ''Who's Who of Nobel Prize Winners, 1901-1990'', (Oryx Press, 1991) p. 203</ref><ref>[http://ravklein.blogspot.com/2006/09/rosh-hashanah-first-evening-sermon.html Rabbi Jonathan Klein's Blog, Sept. 22, 2006]</ref>  He currently serves as a venture partner at [[New Enterprise Associates]].<ref>[http://www.nea.com/Team/Default.aspx?id=12 Team / Arno Penzias]</ref>
