'''Feodor Felix Konrad Lynen''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Foreign Member of the Royal Society|ForMemRS]]}}<ref name="frs"/> ({{IPA-de|ˈfeːodoːɐ̯ ˈlyːnən|-|De-Feodor Lynen.ogg}}; 6 April 1911{{spaced ndash}}6 August 1979) was a [[Germany|German]] [[biochemist]]. In 1964 he won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] together with [[Konrad Emil Bloch|Konrad Bloch]] for their discoveries concerning the mechanism and regulation of [[cholesterol]] and [[fatty acid metabolism]] while he was director of the Max-Planck Institute for Cellular Chemistry in Munich.

==Biography==
Feodor Lynen was born in [[Munich]] on 6 April 1911. He started his studies at the chemistry department of [[University of Munich|Munich University]] in 1930 and graduated in March 1937 under [[Heinrich Otto Wieland|Heinrich Wieland]] with the work: "On the Toxic Substances in Amanita". Lynen remained in Germany throughout World War II. In 1942 he became a chemistry lecturer at the [[University of Munich|Munich University]]. In 1947 he became an assistant professor and in 1953 a professor of biochemistry. From 1954 onwards he was director of the Max-Planck Institute for Cellular Chemistry in Munich, a position which was created for him at the instigation of two senior scientists, [[Otto Heinrich Warburg|Otto Warburg]] and [[Otto Hahn]]. In 1972, that institute was merged into the newly founded [[Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry|Max-Planck Institute of Biochemistry]] in 1972. Also in 1972, Lynen was named President of the [[Gesellschaft Deutscher Chemiker]] (GDCh).<ref name=lynen-nobel-bio>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1964/lynen-bio.html |title= Feodor Lynen — Biographical |access-date= 13 November 2013 |publisher= Nobel Media AB}}</ref>

In 1964 he won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] together with [[Konrad Emil Bloch|Konrad Bloch]] for their discoveries concerning the mechanism and regulation of [[cholesterol]] and [[fatty acid metabolism]]. These discoveries took many years to work out.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bucher NL, Overath P, Lynen F |title=beta-Hydroxy-beta-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase, cleavage and condensing enzymes in relation to cholesterol formation in rat liver |journal=Biochimica et Biophysica Acta |volume=40 |pages=491–501 |date=June 1960 |pmid=13805544 |doi=10.1016/0006-3002(60)91390-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Lynen F |title=The biochemical basis of the biosynthesis of cholesterol and fatty acids |language=de |journal=Wiener Klinische Wochenschrift |volume=78 |issue=27 |pages=489–97 |date=July 1966 |pmid=4296920}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Back P, Hamprecht B, Lynen F |title=Regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis in rat liver: diurnal changes of activity and influence of bile acids |journal=Archives of Biochemistry and Biophysics |volume=133 |issue=1 |pages=11–21 |date=August 1969 |pmid=5810824 |doi=10.1016/0003-9861(69)90482-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Hamprecht B, Nüssler C, Waltinger G, Lynen F |title=Influence of bile acids on the activity of rat liver 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase. 1.

Working mostly separately, Lynen and Bloch both discovered the steps that created squalene and turned the squalene into cholesterol. Initially, Lynen found that acetate activated by Coenzyme A was needed to start the process. He discovered the chemical structure of acetyl-coenzyme A, which was needed for a detailed understanding of the biochemical pathways.<ref name=faq-lynen /> He also learned that [[biotin]], or Vitamin B7, was needed for in the process.<ref name=lynen>{{cite web |last=Lynen |first= Fyodor |title= The pathway from 'activated acetic acid' to the terpenes and fatty acids |date=11 December 1964 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1964/lynen/lecture/ |publisher= Nobel Media AB }}</ref>

On 14 May 1937, Lynen married Eva Wieland (1915–2002), daughter of his academic teacher. They had five children between 1938 and 1946.<ref name=lynen-nobel-bio /> Feodor Lynen died in Munich, Germany, on 6 August 1979, six weeks after an operation for aneurism.<ref name=faq-lynen />
