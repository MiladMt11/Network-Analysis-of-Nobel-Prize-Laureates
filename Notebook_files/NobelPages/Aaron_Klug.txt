==Early life and education==
[[File:Prince Claus, A. Klug and wife.jpg|thumb|300px|From right to left: [[Prince Claus of the Netherlands]], Aaron Klug and his wife Liebe Bobrow, 1979]]
Klug was born in [[Želva]], in Lithuania, to [[Lithuanian Jews|Jewish]] parents Lazar, a cattleman, and Bella (née Silin) Klug, with whom he moved to South Africa at the age of two.<ref name="camb">{{cite web|title=The Papers of Sir Aaron Klug|url=https://archivesearch.lib.cam.ac.uk/repositories/9/resources/1667|url-status=live|access-date=|publisher=[[Churchill Archives Centre]]}}</ref><ref name="did">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00947r7 |title=Desert Island Discs – Castaway : Sir Aaron Klug first broadcast 2002-05-12 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref> He was educated at [[Durban High School]].<ref name=whoswho/> [[Paul de Kruif]]'s 1926 book, '' Microbe Hunters'', aroused his interest in microbiology.<ref name=lance/>

He started to study microbiology, but then moved into physics and maths, graduating with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]], in Johannesburg.  He studied physics and obtained his [[Master of Science]] degree at the [[University of Cape Town]].<ref name=whoswho/> He was awarded an [[1851 Research Fellowship]] from the [[Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851]],<ref>1851 Royal Commission Archives</ref> which enabled him to move to England, completing his PhD in research physics at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1953.<ref name=aphd>{{cite thesis|first=Aaron|last=Klug|title=The kinetics of phase changes in solids.|year=1953|degree=PhD|publisher=University of Cambridge|id={{ProQuest|301283484}}}}</ref>

==Career and research==
Following his PhD, Klug moved to [[Birkbeck, University of London|Birkbeck College]] in the [[University of London]] in late 1953, and started working with virologist [[Rosalind Franklin]] in the lab of crystallographer [[J. D. Bernal|John Bernal]]. This experience aroused a lifelong interest in the study of viruses, and during his time there he made discoveries in the structure<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Amos | first1 = L. | last2 = Finch | first2 = J. T. | title = Aaron Klug and the revolution in biomolecular structure determination | doi = 10.1016/j.tcb.2004.01.002 | journal = Trends in Cell Biology | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 148–152 | year = 2004 | pmid =  15003624}}</ref> of the [[tobacco mosaic virus]]. In 1962 he moved to the newly built [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] (MRC) [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]] (LMB) in Cambridge. Over the following decade Klug used methods from [[X-ray diffraction]], microscopy and structural modelling to develop crystallographic electron microscopy in which a sequence of two-dimensional images of crystals taken from different angles are combined to produce three-dimensional images of the target. He studied the structure of [[transfer RNA]], and found what is known as [[zinc fingers]] as well as the neurofibrils in Alzheimer's disease.<ref name=lance>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(18)33109-X|title = Aaron Klug|journal = The Lancet|volume = 392|issue = 10164|pages = 2546|year = 2018|last1 = Watts|first1 = Geoff|doi-access = free}}</ref>

Also in 1962 Klug had been offered a teaching Fellowship at [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]]. After receiving the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1982, he went on teaching because he found the courses interesting and was later made an Honorary Fellow at the College.<ref name=whoswho/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pet.cam.ac.uk/welcome-peterhouse/eminent-petreans|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626222241/http://www.pet.cam.ac.uk/eminent-petreans|archive-date=26 June 2015|title=Eminent Petreans|publisher=[[University of Cambridge]]}}</ref>

Between 1986 and 1996 he was director of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge.
Klug served{{when|date=December 2018}} on the Advisory Council for the [[Campaign for Science and Engineering]].<ref name="CaSE Advisory Council">{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencecampaign.org.uk/about/who/advisory.htm |title=Advisory Council of the Campaign for Science and Engineering |publisher=Sciencecampaign.org.uk |access-date=11 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828110110/http://www.sciencecampaign.org.uk/about/who/advisory.htm |archive-date=28 August 2010 }}</ref> He also served{{when|date=December 2018}} on the Board of Scientific Governors at [[The Scripps Research Institute]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scripps.edu/newsandviews/e_20040126/board.html|title=Scripps Research Scientific Board Meets in Florida|publisher=[[Scripps Research Institute]]|date=26 January 2004|access-date=3 March 2016}}</ref>
He and [[David Allan Rees|Dai Rees]] approached the [[Wellcome Trust]] to found the [[Wellcome Sanger Institute]], which was a key player in the [[Human Genome Project]].<ref name=lance/>

===Awards and honours===
Klug was awarded the [[Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize]] from [[Columbia University]] in 1981. He was [[knight Bachelor|knighted]] by [[Elizabeth II]] in 1988.<ref name=virt>{{cite web|title=Aaron Klug (1926–)|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/klug.html|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|access-date=7 November 2009}}</ref> In 1969 he was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1969|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS)]],<ref name=frs/><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crowther|first=R.

He was elected its [[List of presidents of the Royal Society|President (PRS)]] from 1995 to 2000. He was appointed to the [[Order of Merit]] in 1995 – as is customary for Presidents of the Royal Society. His certificate of election to the Royal Society reads: {{centered pull quote|Mathematical physicist and crystallographer distinguished for his contributions to molecular biology, especially the structure of viruses. Development of a theory of simultaneous temperature and phase changes in steels led him to apply related mathematical methods to the problem of diffusion and chemical reactions of gases in thin layers of haemoglobin solutions and in red blood cells. Then the late [[Rosalind Franklin]] introduced him to the x-ray study of tobacco mosaic virus to which he contributed by his application and further development of [[William Cochran (physicist)|Cochran]] and [[Francis Crick|Crick]]'s theory of diffraction from helical chain molecules. Klug's most important work is concerned with the structure of spherical viruses. Together with [[Donald Caspar|D. Caspar]] he developed a general theory of spherical shells built up of a regular array of asymmetric particles. Klug and his collaborators verified the theory by x-ray and electron microscope studies, thereby revealing new and hitherto unsuspected features of virus structure.<ref name=royal>{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190708141257/https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqCmd=show.tcl&dsqSearch=%28RefNo%3D%3D%27EC%2F1969%2F19%27%29 |archive-date=8 July 2019 |url=https://collections.royalsociety.org/DServe.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqDb=Catalog&dsqCmd=show.tcl&dsqSearch=(RefNo==%27EC%2F1969%2F19%27 |publisher=[[Royal Society]] |location=London |title=Certificate of Election EC/1969/19: Aaron Klug |url-status=dead}}</ref>}}

In 2013, Israel's [[Ben-Gurion University of the Negev]] dedicated their centre for structural biology in Klug's name, ''Aaron Klug Integrated Centre for Biomolecular Structure''. He, his family and the then-British Ambassador to Israel [[Matthew Gould]], were in attendance.

==Personal life==
Klug married Liebe Bobrow in 1948.<ref name=whoswho/> Though Klug had faced discrimination in South Africa, he remained religious and according to [[Sydney Brenner]], he became more religious in his older age.<ref>Hargittai, Istva'n & Magdolna. 2006.
