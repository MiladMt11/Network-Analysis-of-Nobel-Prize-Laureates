==Education and early life==
Fraser Stoddart was born in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, on 24 May 1942.

==Career==
In 1967, he went to [[Queen's University at Kingston|Queen's University]] (Canada) as a [[National Research Council of Canada|National Research Council]] Postdoctoral Fellow, and then, in 1970, to the [[University of Sheffield]] as an [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI) Research Fellow, before joining the academic staff as a lecturer in chemistry. In 1978, he was transferred to the ICI Corporate Laboratory where he first started investigating the mechanically interlocked molecules that would eventually become molecular machines.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2016/stoddart/lecture/|title=Sir J.

==Research==
Stoddart is one of only a few chemists of the past quarter century to pioneer a new field in organic chemistry.  By establishing a new field where the main feature is mechanical bonds he has paved the way for molecular recognition, self-assembly processes for template-directed mechanically interlocked syntheses, molecular switches, and motor-molecules. These advances have formed the basis of the fields of nanoelectronic devices, nanoelectromechanical systems, and molecular machines.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://stoddart.northwestern.edu/fraser-stoddart/|title=Fraser Stoddart – Stoddart Mechanostereochemistry Group|website=stoddart.northwestern.edu|language=en-US|access-date=19 November 2018}}</ref><ref name="NP-20161005" />

One of his major contributions to the development of [[mechanically-interlocked molecular architectures]] such as [[rotaxane]]s and [[catenane]]s has been the establishment of efficient synthetic protocols based on the binding of [[cyclobis(paraquat-p-phenylene)|cyclobis(paraquat-''p''-phenylene)]] with electron-rich aromatic guests.<ref name="Stoddart 2009 p=1802">{{cite journal | last=Stoddart | first=J.

Stoddart's papers and other material are instantly recognizable due to a distinctive "[[cartoon]]"-style of [[scientific visualization|representation]] he has developed since the late 1980s. A solid circle is often placed in the middle of the [[aromatic]] rings of the molecular structures he has reported, and different colors to highlight different parts of the molecules. Indeed, he was one of the first researchers to make extensive use of color in chemistry publications. The different colors usually correspond to the different parts of a cartoon representation of the molecule, but are also used to represent specific molecular properties (blue, for example, is used to represent [[electron acceptor|electron-poor recognition units]] while red is used to represent the corresponding [[electron donor|electron-rich recognition units]]). The distinctive coloring has led to coining the term 'little blue box' for cyclophane, an important π-acceptor used to synthesize mechanically bonded structures.<ref name=":0" /> Stoddart maintains this standardized color scheme across all of his publications and presentations, and his style has been adopted by other researchers reporting mechanically interlocked molecules based on his syntheses.<ref name="Art">{{cite news|title=Fraser Stoddart: Mingling Art with Science|url=http://steamconnect.org/fraser-stoddart-mingling-art-with-science/|access-date=27 May 2016|work=Ste(a)m Connect}}</ref><ref name="Brough">{{cite journal|last1=Brough|first1=B.|last2=Northrop|first2=B.
