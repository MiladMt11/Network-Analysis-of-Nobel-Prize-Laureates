'''Ernest Thomas Sinton Walton''' (6 October 1903 – 25 June 1995) was an [[Ireland|Irish]] physicist and [[Nobel Prize for Physics|Nobel laureate]] for his work with [[John Cockcroft]] with "[[Cockcroft–Walton generator|atom-smashing]]" experiments done at [[Cambridge University]] in the early 1930s, and so became the first person in history to split the atom.

==Early years==
Ernest Walton was born in [[Abbeyside]], [[Dungarvan]], [[County Waterford]] to a [[Methodist]] minister father, Rev John Walton (1874–1936) and Anna Sinton (1874–1906). In those days a general clergyman's family moved once every three years, and this practice carried Ernest and his family, while he was a small child, to Rathkeale, [[County Limerick]] (where his mother died) and to [[County Monaghan]]. He attended day schools in counties [[County Down|Down]] and [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]], and at [[Wesley College Dublin]] before becoming a boarder at [[Methodist College Belfast]] in 1915, where he excelled in science and mathematics.<ref>[https://ulsterhistorycircle.org.uk/ernest-walton/ Ernest Walton] 18 April 2015 ''ulsterhistorycircle.org.uk'', accessed 22 November 2021</ref><ref>[https://www.encyclopedia.com/science/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/ernest-thomas-sinton-walton Ernest Thomas Sinton Walton] ''www.encyclopedia.com'', accessed 22 November 2021</ref>

In 1922 Walton won scholarships to [[Trinity College Dublin]] for the study of mathematics and science, and would go on to be [[List of Scholars of Trinity College Dublin|elected a Foundation Scholar]] in 1924. He was awarded bachelor's and master's degrees from Trinity in 1926 and 1927, respectively. During these years at college, Walton received numerous prizes for excellence in physics and mathematics (seven prizes in all), including the [[List of Scholars of Trinity College Dublin|Foundation Scholarship]] in 1924. Following graduation he was awarded an [[1851 Research Fellowship]] from the [[Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851]]<ref>1851 Royal Commission Archives</ref> and was accepted as a research student at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], under the supervision of Sir [[Ernest Rutherford]], Director of [[Cambridge University]]'s [[Cavendish Laboratory]]. At the time there were four Nobel Prize laureates on the staff at the Cavendish lab and a further five were to emerge, including Walton and [[John Cockcroft]]. Walton was awarded his PhD in 1931 and remained at Cambridge as a researcher until 1934.<ref name="walt"/>

During the early 1930s Walton and John Cockcroft collaborated to build an apparatus that split the [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of [[lithium]] [[atoms]] by bombarding them with a stream of [[protons]] accelerated inside a high-voltage tube (700 kilovolts).<ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society A]] |issn=1364-5021 |first1=J.

Walton was associated with the [[Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies]] for over 40 years,  e.g., serving long periods on the board of the School of Cosmic Physics and on the Council of the Institute.  Following the 1952 death of [[John J. Nolan]], the inaugural chairman of the School of Cosmic Physics, Walton assumed the role, and served in that position until 1960, when he was succeeded by John H. Poole.<ref>[https://www.dias.ie/2015/05/08/dias-1947/ Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies:  Council and Governing Boards as of 31/3/1947] ''www.dias.ie'', accessed 19 November 2021</ref><ref>[https://www.dias.ie/2015/05/08/dias-1953/ Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies:  Council and Governing Boards as of 31/3/1953] ''www.dias.ie'', accessed 19 November 2021</ref>

==Career at Trinity College Dublin==
Ernest Walton returned to Ireland in 1934 to become a Fellow of Trinity College Dublin in the physics department, and in 1946 was appointed [[Erasmus Smith's Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy at Trinity College Dublin|Erasmus Smith's Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy]].<ref name="walt"/> Walton's lecturing was considered outstanding as he had the ability to present complicated matters in simple and easy-to-understand terms. His research interests were pursued with very limited resources, yet he was able to study, in the late 1950s, the [[phosphorescent]] effect in glasses, secondary-electron emissions from surfaces under positive-ion bombardment, radiocarbon dating and low-level counting, and the deposition of thin films on glass.{{citation needed|reason=better ref desired, preferably one for each of these topics|date=November 2021}}<ref>[https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/201904/history.cfm This Month in Physics History: April 14, 1932: Cockcroft and Walton Split the Atom] ''www.aps.org''/ APS News April 2019 (Volume 28, Number 4), accessed 20 November 2021</ref>

==Later years and death==
Although he retired from Trinity College Dublin in 1974, he retained his association with the Physics Department at Trinity up to his final illness. His was a familiar face in the tea-room. Shortly before his death he marked his lifelong devotion to Trinity by presenting his Nobel medal and citation to the college.<ref>[http://www.tcd.ie/Physics/history/walton/walton_biography.php Ernest Walton profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108035954/http://www.tcd.ie/Physics/history/walton/walton_biography.php |date=8 January 2009 }}, tcd.ie; accessed 4 June 2016.</ref> Ernest Walton died in [[Belfast]] on 25 June 1995, aged 91.

==Religious views==
Raised as a [[Methodist]], Walton has been described as someone who was strongly committed to the Christian faith.<ref>V. J. McBrierty: Ernest Thomas Sinton Walton, The Irish Scientist, 1903-1995 (Trinity College Dublin, 2003)</ref> He even gave lectures about the relationship of science and religion in several countries after he won the Nobel Prize,<ref>[http://www.cis.org.uk/ireland/walton/lectures.html Walton was strongly committed to the Methodist faith, and following the award of the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1951 jointly to himself and John Cockcroft, he spoke on science and religion to audiences in Ireland, the United States, and Sweden], cis.org.uk; accessed 4 June 2016.</ref> and he encouraged the progress of science as a way to know more about God; Walton said:{{Quote|"One way to learn the mind of the Creator is to study His creation. We must pay God the compliment of studying His work of art and this should apply to all realms of human thought. A refusal to use our intelligence honestly is an act of contempt for Him who gave us that intelligence"|V. J. McBrierty (2003): ''Ernest Thomas Sinton Walton, The Irish Scientist, 1903-1995'', Trinity College Dublin Press.)<ref>[http://www.cis.org.uk/ireland/walton/walton.html Ernest T. S. Walton profile], cis.org.uk; accessed 4 June 2016.</ref>}}

Walton held an interest in topics about the government and the Church,<ref>Gale Research Inc (1998). "Encyclopedia of World Biography: Vitoria-Zworykin": ''Outside of his scientific work, Ernest Walton was active in committees concerned with the government, the church, research and standards, scientific academies, and the Royal City of Dublin Hospital. ''</ref> and after his death, the organisation ''[[Christians in Science]] Ireland'' established the  ''Walton Lectures on Science and Religion'' (an initiative similar to the [[Boyle Lectures]]). [[David Wilkinson (theologian)|David Wilkinson]], [[Denis Alexander]], and others have given Walton Lectures in universities across Ireland.<ref>[http://www.cis.org.uk/ireland/walton/; Walton Lectures on Science and Religion] ''www.cis.org.uk'' accessed 25 February 2020.</ref>

Along with [[Lochlainn O'Raifeartaigh]] and Michael Fry, Walton helped found the Irish [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs|Pugwash]] group, opposing the nuclear weapons race.<ref>[https://www.irishtimes.com/news/irish-physicist-who-had-a-theorem-named-after-him-1.1117758 Irish physicist who had a theorem named after him] 25 November 2000 ''www.irishtimes.com'', accessed 22 November 2021</ref>

==Honours==
Walton and John Cockcroft were recipients of the 1951 Nobel Prize in Physics for their "work on the transmutation of the [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] by artificially accelerated atomic particles" (popularly known as ''splitting the atom''). They are credited with being the first to disintegrate the lithium nucleus by bombardment with accelerated protons (or hydrogen nuclei) and identifying [[helium]] nuclei in the products in 1930. More generally, they had built an apparatus which showed that [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of various lightweight elements (such as lithium) could be split by fast-moving protons.

Walton and Cockcroft received the [[Hughes Medal]] of the [[Royal Society]] of London in 1938.<ref>{{cite book |last= Mehra |first=Jagdish |title= The Historical Development of Quantum Theory |publisher=Springer |page= 36 |year=2001 |isbn= 978-0-387-96284-9}}</ref> In much later years – and predominantly after his retirement in 1974 – Walton received honorary degrees or [[conferrals]] from numerous Irish, British, and North American institutions.<ref>[https://www.dib.ie/biography/walton-ernest-thomas-sinton-a8909 McBrierty, Vincent: Walton, Ernest Thomas Sinton] ''www.dib.ie'', accessed 20 November 2021</ref>

The "Walton Causeway Park" in Walton's native [[Dungarvan]] was dedicated in his honour with Walton himself attending the ceremony in 1989.<ref name=place/> After his death the [[Waterford Institute of Technology]] named a large building the ''ETS Walton Building''<ref>Barry Roche, [https://www.irishtimes.com/news/waterford-institute-opens-15m-facilities-1.410416 Waterford institute opens €15m facilities] 29 January 2005, ''www.irishtimes.com'', accessed 20 November 2021</ref> and a plaque was placed on the site of his birthplace.<ref name=place>[https://www.theirishplace.com/heritage/ernest-walton-the-irish-man-who-split-the-atom/ Ernest Walton: The Irish Man Who Split the Atom] 6 March 2016 ''www.theirishplace.com'', accessed 20 November 2021</ref>

Other honours for Walton include the Walton Building at Methodist College, Belfast, the school where he had been a boarder for five years, and a memorial plaque outside the main entrance to Methodist College. Also, there is the [[Walton Prize for Physics]] at Wesley College, where he attended and for many years served as chairman of the board of Governors, and a prize with the same name at Methodist College, which is awarded to the pupil who obtains the highest marks in A Level Physics. There is also a scholarship in [[Waterford]] named after Walton.<ref>[http://www.businessandleadership.com/leadership/item/34705-scholarship-in-waterford-na Walton scholarship], businessandleadership.com; accessed 4 June 2016.</ref> In 2014, Trinity College Dublin set up the ''Trinity Walton Club'',<ref>[https://www.tcd.ie/waltonclub/about.php Trinity Walton Club], tcd.ie; accessed 17 November 2021.</ref> an extracurricular STEM Education centre for teenagers.
