'''Giorgio Parisi''' (born 4 August 1948) is an Italian [[theoretical physicist]], whose research has focused on [[quantum field theory]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[complex systems]]. His best known contributions are the [[Quantum chromodynamics|QCD]] evolution equations for parton densities, obtained with [[Guido Altarelli]], known as the Altarelli–Parisi or [[DGLAP]] equations, the exact solution of the [[Sherrington–Kirkpatrick model]] of spin glasses, the [[Kardar–Parisi–Zhang equation]] describing dynamic scaling of growing interfaces, and the study of whirling [[flocks of birds]].<ref> Parisi awarded the [[Nobel prize in physics]] in 2021.

==Career==
Giorgio Parisi received his degree from the [[University of Rome La Sapienza]] in 1970 under the supervision of [[Nicola Cabibbo]]. He was a researcher at the [[Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati]] (1971–1981) and a visiting scientist at the [[Columbia University]] (1973–1974), [[Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques]] (1976–1977), and [[École Normale Supérieure]] (1977–1978). From 1981 until 1992 he was a full professor of Theoretical Physics at the [[University of Rome Tor Vergata]] and he is now professor of Quantum Theories at the [[Sapienza University of Rome]]. He is a member of the Simons Collaboration "Cracking the Glass Problem".<ref>

==Research==
Parisi's research interests are broad and cover [[statistical physics]], [[field theory (physics)|field theory]], [[dynamical system]]s, [[mathematical physics]] and [[condensed matter physics]], where he is particularly known for his work on [[spin glasses]] and related statistical mechanics models originating in [[optimization theory]] and biology.<ref>Marc Mézard, Giorgio Parisi, Miguel Angel Virasoro (1987), ''Spin glass theory and beyond: An Introduction to the Replica Method and Its Applications'', World Scientific,  ISBN 978-9971501150.</ref> In particular, he made significant contributions in terms of systematic applications of the replica method to disordered systems, even though the replica method itself was originally discovered in 1971 by Sir [[Sam_Edwards_(physicist)|Sam Edwards]].<ref>Sam Edwards (1971), Statistical mechanics of rubber. In ''Polymer networks: structural and mechanical properties'', (eds A. J. Chompff & S. Newman). New York: Plenum Press,  ISBN 978-1-4757-6210-5.</ref>

He has also contributed to the field of [[elementary particle physics]], in particular to [[quantum chromodynamics]] and [[string theory]]. Together with Guido Altarelli, he introduced the so-called Dokshitzer–Gribov–Lipatov–Altarelli–Parisi equations.<ref>G. Altarelli and G. Parisi, Asymptotic freedom in parton language, in Nuclear Physics B, vol. 126, n. 2, 1977, pp. 298–318, {{doi|10.1016/0550-3213(77)90384-4}}.</ref> In the field of [[fluid dynamics]] he is known for having introduced, together with [[Uriel Frisch]], multifractal models to describe the phenomenon of intermittence in turbulent flows.<ref>Uriel Frisch and Giorgio Parisi, ''[http://www-thphys.physics.ox.ac.uk/people/AlexanderSchekochihin/wpi/workshop2_pdfs/frisch2.pdf On the singularity structure of fully developed turbulence]'', appendix to ''Fully developed turbulence and intermittency'' by Uriel Frisch, in Proc. Int. Summer School Phys. Enrico Fermi.</ref> He is also known for the [[Kardar–Parisi–Zhang equation]] modelling stochastic aggregation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kardar|first=Mehran|last2=Parisi|first2=Giorgio|last3=Zhang|first3=Yi-Cheng|date=1986-03-03|title=Dynamic Scaling of Growing Interfaces|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.56.889|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=56|issue=9|pages=889–892|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.56.889}}</ref> From the point of view of complex systems, he worked on the collective motion of animals (such as swarms and flocks). He also introduced, together with other Italian physicists, the concept of [[stochastic resonance]] in the study of climate change.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Benzi|first=Roberto|last2=Parisi|first2=Giorgio|last3=Sutera|first3=Alfonso|last4=Vulpiani|first4=Angelo|date=1982|title=Stochastic resonance in climatic change|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2153-3490.1982.tb01787.x|journal=Tellus|language=en|volume=34|issue=1|pages=10–16|doi=10.1111/j.2153-3490.1982.tb01787.x|issn=2153-3490}}</ref>
