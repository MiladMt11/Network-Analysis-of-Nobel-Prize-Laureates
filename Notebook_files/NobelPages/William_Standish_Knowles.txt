'''William Standish Knowles''' (June 1, 1917 – June 13, 2012) was an [[United States|American]] [[chemist]]. He was born in [[Taunton, Massachusetts]].  Knowles was one of the recipients of the 2001 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].  He split half the prize with [[Ryōji Noyori]] for their work in [[asymmetric synthesis]], specifically for his work in [[asymmetric hydrogenation|hydrogenation reactions]].  The other half was awarded to [[K. Barry Sharpless]] for his work in [[Oxidation|oxidation reactions]].<ref>{{Cite journal

==Education==
Knowles attended [[Berkshire School]] in [[Sheffield, Massachusetts]]. He led his class academically and upon graduation was admitted to [[Harvard University]] after passing the [[College Board]] exams. Feeling that he was too young to go to college, Knowles spent a year at [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]]. At the end of the year, he captured his first award in chemistry, the school's $50 Boylston Prize.<ref name=nobelbio>{{cite web|title=William S. Knowles - Autobiography|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2001/knowles.html|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|access-date=2011-04-07|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110621151907/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/2001/knowles.html|archive-date=2011-06-21}}</ref>

After his year in [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]], Knowles attended Harvard, where he majored in [[chemistry]], focusing on [[organic chemistry]].  He received his undergraduate degree in 1939, and attended [[Columbia University]] for graduate school.<ref name=nobelbio />

===Nobel Prize===
He shared half of the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 2001 with [[Ryōji Noyori]] for "their work on chirally catalysed hydrogenation reactions". The other half of the prize was awarded to [[K. Barry Sharpless]] for the development of a range of catalytic asymmetric oxidations. Knowles developed one of the first [[asymmetric hydrogenation]] catalysts by replacing the achiral [[triphenylphosphine]] ligands in [[Wilkinson's catalyst]] with chiral [[phosphine ligand]]s. This experimental catalyst was effective for [[enantioselective synthesis]], achieving a modest 15% [[enantiomeric excess]].

Knowles was also the first to apply enantioselective metal catalysis to industrial-scale synthesis; while working for the [[Monsanto Company]] he developed an enantioselective hydrogenation step for the production of [[L-DOPA]], utilising the [[DIPAMP]] ligand.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vineyard|first=B.

==Personal life==
Following his retirement in 1986, Knowles resided in Chesterfield, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. In retirement he restored native prairie grasses on a 100-acre farm that his wife had inherited. He was married to his wife, Nancy, for 66 years and had four children, Elizabeth, Peter, Sarah and Lesley. He also had four grandchildren. Knowles died in Chesterfield on June 13, 2012 at age 95. He and his wife had previously stated that their farm would be donated to be converted into a city park after their deaths.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/16/science/william-s-knowles-dies-at-84-shared-nobel-prize-in-chemistry.html|title=William Knowles, Nobel Winner in Chemistry, Dies at 95|date=June 15, 2012|work=The New York Times}}</ref>
