==Biography==
Siegbahn was born in [[Örebro]], Sweden, the son of Georg Siegbahn and his wife, Emma Zetterberg.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://runeberg.org/vemarvem/sthlm45/0776.html|title=Vem är vem?. D. 1, Stockholmsdelen|publisher=Vem är vem bokförlag|year=1945|editor-last=Harnesk|editor-first=Paul|location=Stockholm|pages=760|language=sv}}</ref>

He graduated in Stockholm 1906 and began his studies at [[Lund University]] in the same year.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fysik i Lund under 300 år|last=Litzén|first=Ulf|publisher=Lunds universitetshistoriska sällskap|year=2015|isbn=9789175453200|location=Lund|pages=87|language=sv}}</ref> During his education he was secretarial assistant to [[Johannes Rydberg]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Manne Siegbahn : 1886 3/12 1951|last=Hulthén|first=Erik|year=1951|location=Uppsala|pages=3|language=sv|chapter=1900–1925, fysikalisk forskning i Lund under ett kvartsekel}}</ref> In 1908 he studied at the University of Göttingen.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Beweis 1924: Prismen brechen auch Röntgenstrahlen|url=http://www.wiki-goettingen.de/images/6/6a/Siegbahn.pdf|publisher=Universität Göttingen|language=de}}</ref> He obtained his doctorate (PhD) at the Lund University in 1911, his thesis was titled ''Magnetische Feldmessungen'' (magnetic field measurements). He became acting professor for Rydberg when his (Rydberg's) health was failing, and succeeded him as full professor in 1920.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fysik i Lund under 300 år|last=Litzén|year=2015|pages=95}}</ref> However, in 1922 he left Lund for a professorship at [[Uppsala University]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fysik i Lund under 300 år|last=Litzén|year=2015|pages=96|language=sv}}</ref>

In 1937, Siegbahn was appointed Director of the Physics Department of the Nobel Institute of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In 1988 this was renamed the Manne Siegbahn Institute (MSI).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.msl.se/MSL_files/history.htm|title=The MSL History|date=2014-12-10|website=msl.se|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427231243/http://www.msl.se/MSL_files/history.htm|archive-date=2015-04-27|access-date=2017-04-23|url-status=dead}}</ref> The institute research groups have been reorganized since, but the name lives on in the Manne Siegbahn Laboratory hosted by [[Stockholm University]].

== X-ray spectroscopy ==
Manne Siegbahn began his studies of X-ray spectroscopy in 1914. Initially he used the same type of [[spectrometer]] as [[Henry Moseley]] had done for finding the relationship between the [[wavelength]] of some [[Chemical element|elements]] and their place at the [[periodic system]]. Shortly thereafter he developed improved experimental apparatus which allowed him to make very accurate measurements of the X-ray wavelengths produced by atoms of different elements. Also, he found that several of the [[spectral line]]s that Moseley had discovered consisted of more components. By studying these components and improving the spectrometer, Siegbahn got an almost complete understanding of the [[electron shell]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fysik i Lund under 300 år|last=Litzén|year=2015|pages=90|language=sv}}</ref> He developed a convention for naming the different spectral lines that are characteristic to elements in X-ray spectroscopy, the [[Siegbahn notation]]. Siegbahn's precision measurements drove many developments in [[Quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and [[atomic physics]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1924/press.html|title=Nobel Prize in Physics 1924 - Presentation Speech|year=2014|website=Nobelprize.org|publisher=Nobel Media AB|access-date=2017-04-23}}</ref>

==Awards and honours==
Siegbahn was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1924. He won the [[Hughes Medal]] 1934 and [[Rumford Medal]] 1940. In 1944, he patented the Siegbahn pump. Siegbahn was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1954|Foreign Member of the Royal Society in 1954]].<ref name="frs"/>

==Personal life==
Siegbahn married Karin Högbom in 1914. They had two children: [[Bo Siegbahn]] (1915–2008), a diplomat and politician, and [[Kai Siegbahn]] (1918–2007), a physicist who received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1981 for his contribution to the development of [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]].
