'''José Manuel Ramos-Horta''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Prince Henry|GColIH]] [[Order of Liberty|GCL]]}} ({{IPA-pt|ʒuˈzɛ ˈʁɐ̃muz ˈɔɾtɐ}}; born 26 December 1949) is an [[East Timor]]ese politician who was the [[President of East Timor]] from 20 May 2007 to 20 May 2012. Previously, he was [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation (East Timor)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] from 2002 to 2006 and [[Prime Minister of East Timor|Prime Minister]] from 2006 to 2007. He is a co-recipient of the 1996 [[Nobel Peace Prize]], along with [[Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo]], for working "towards a just and peaceful solution to the conflict in East Timor".

As a founder and former member of [[Fretilin]], Ramos-Horta served as the exiled spokesman for the East Timorese resistance during the years of the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]] (1975&ndash;1999). While he continued to work with Fretilin, Ramos-Horta resigned from the party in 1988, becoming an [[independent politician]].<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Age |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/horta-vows-to-rebuild-timor/2006/07/09/1152383610425.html |title=Ramos Horta vows to rebuild Timor |author=Lindsay Murdoch |access-date=27 September 2006 |location=Melbourne |date=10 July 2006}}</ref>

After East Timor achieved independence in 2002, Ramos-Horta was appointed as the country's first foreign minister. He served in this position until his resignation on 25 June 2006, amidst [[2006 East Timorese crisis|political turmoil]]. On 26 June, following the resignation of Prime Minister [[Mari Alkatiri]], Ramos-Horta was appointed as acting Prime Minister by President [[Xanana Gusmão]]. Two weeks later, on 10 July 2006, he was sworn in as the second Prime Minister of East Timor. He was [[2007 East Timorese presidential election|elected as President]] in 2007. On 11 February 2008, Ramos-Horta was shot during an [[2008 East Timorese assassination attempts|assassination attempt]].

After leaving office as President in 2012, Ramos-Horta was appointed as the [[United Nations|United Nations']] Special Representative and Head of the [[United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-Bissau]] (UNIOGBIS) on 2 January 2013.

He was educated in a [[Catholic missions|Catholic mission]] in the small village of [[Soibada]], later chosen by Fretilin as headquarters after the [[Indonesian invasion of East Timor|Indonesian invasion]]. Of his eleven brothers and sisters, four were killed by the [[Indonesian military]].

Ramos-Horta studied Public [[International Law]] at [[The Hague Academy of International Law]] in 1983 and at [[Antioch College]] in [[Yellow Springs, Ohio]]—where he completed a Master of Arts degree in [[Peace Studies]]—in 1984. He was trained in [[Human Rights Law]] at the [[International Institute of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]] in 1983.

==Political career==
[[File:José Ramos-Horta 1976.jpg|thumb|left|José Ramos-Horta (1976)]]
He was actively involved in the development of political awareness in Portuguese Timor, which caused him to be exiled for two years in 1970–71 to [[Portuguese East Africa]]. His grandfather, before him, had also been exiled, from [[Portugal]] to the [[Azores Islands]], then [[Cape Verde]], [[Guinea-Bissau|Portuguese Guinea]] and finally to Portuguese Timor.

A moderate in the emerging Timorese nationalist leadership, he was appointed [[Foreign Minister]] in the "Democratic Republic of East Timor" government proclaimed by the pro-independence parties in November 1975. When appointed minister, Ramos-Horta was only 25 years old. Ramos-Horta left East Timor three days before the Indonesian troops invaded to plead the Timorese case before the UN.

Ramos-Horta arrived in New York to address the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] and urge them to take action in the face of the Indonesian occupation during which an estimated 102,000 East Timorese would die.<ref>A detailed statistical report prepared for the [[Commission for Reception, Truth and Reconciliation in East Timor]] cited a lower range of 102,800 conflict-related deaths in the period 1974–1999, namely, approximately 18,600 killings and 84,200 'excess' deaths from hunger and illness. ( {{cite web |author=Benetech Human Rights Data Analysis Group |title=The Profile of Human Rights Violations in Timor-Leste, 1974–1999 |work=A Report to the Commission on Reception, Truth and Reconciliation of Timor-Leste |publisher=Human Rights Data Analysis Group (HRDAG) |date=9 February 2006 |url=http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml |url-status=dead |access-date=12 February 2008 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120529004414/http://www.hrdag.org/resources/timor_chapter_graphs/timor_chapter_page_02.shtml |archive-date=29 May 2012 }}</ref> Ramos-Horta was the Permanent Representative of Fretilin to the UN for the next ten years. His friends at that time mentioned that he arrived in the United States with a total of $25 in his pocket. His pecuniary situation was often straitened in that period; he survived partly by grace of Americans who admired his politics and his determination. Further, he was obliged to travel worldwide to explain his party's position.

In 1993, the [[Rafto Prize]] was awarded to the people of East Timor. Foreign-minister-in-exile Ramos-Horta represented his nation at the prize ceremony. In May 1994, [[President of the Philippines|Philippine President]] [[Fidel Ramos]] (no relation), bowing to pressure from [[Jakarta]], tried to ban an international conference on East Timor in [[Manila]] and blacklisted Ramos-Horta, with the Thai government following suit later that year by declaring him [[persona non grata]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/se-asia/BB01Ae01.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000929054732/http://www.atimes.com/se-asia/BB01Ae01.html|url-status=unfit|archive-date=29 September 2000|title=Asia Times: Asean's commitment to East Timor faces tough test|access-date=22 March 2017}}</ref>

In December 1996, Ramos-Horta shared the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] with fellow Timorese, [[Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo|Bishop Ximenes Belo]]. The Nobel Committee chose to honour the two laureates for their "sustained efforts to hinder the oppression of a small people", hoping that "this award will spur efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the conflict of East Timor based on the people's right to self-determination". The Committee considered Ramos-Horta "the leading international spokesman for East Timor's cause since 1975".<ref>The Norwegian Nobel Committee (2006).

Ramos-Horta played a leading role in negotiating the institutional foundations for independence. He led the Timorese delegation at an important joint workshop with UNTAET on 1 March 2000 to tease out a new strategy, and identify institutional needs. The outcome was an agreed blueprint for a joint administration with executive powers, including leaders of the [[National Congress for Timorese Reconstruction]] (CNRT). Further details were worked out in a conference in May 2000. The [[Special Representative of the Secretary-General for East Timor|Special Representative of the UN Secretary-General in East Timor]], [[Sérgio Vieira de Mello]], presented the new blueprint to a donor conference in Lisbon,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/peace/etimor/DB/DB210600.HTM |title=New structure of NCC proposed |date=21 June 2000}}</ref> on 22 June 2000, and to the UN Security Council on 27 June 2000.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2000/20000627.sc6882.doc.html |date=27 June 2000 |title= SC/6882 : Security Council briefed by Sergio Vieira de Mello, Special representative for East Timor}}</ref> On 12 July 2000, the NCC adopted a regulation establishing a Transitional Cabinet composed of four East Timorese and four UNTAET representatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unmit.org/UNMISETWebSite.nsf/TimeLineofUNMISET.htm?OpenPage |title=? |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419101101/http://www.unmit.org/UNMISETWebSite.nsf/TimeLineofUNMISET.htm?OpenPage |archive-date=19 April 2008 }}</ref> The revamped joint administration successfully laid the institutional foundations for independence, and on 27 September 2002, East Timor joined the United Nations.
