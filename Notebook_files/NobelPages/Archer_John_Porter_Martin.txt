'''Archer John Porter Martin''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE|FRS}} (1 March 1910 – 28 July 2002) was a British chemist who shared the 1952 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for the invention of partition [[chromatography]] with [[Richard Synge]].<ref name="Jones">{{cite web |author-first=Mark |author-last=Jones|title=Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry  |url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/gas-chromatography-mass-spectrometry.html |website=American Chemical Society |access-date=19 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Nobel Winner Archer Martin Dies|url=https://apnews.com/5ed3f757479daeef349ca528117234a9|access-date=2020-06-26|website=AP NEWS}}</ref>

==Early life==
Martin's father was a [[General practitioner|GP]]. Martin was educated at [[Bedford School]], and [[Peterhouse, Cambridge]].{{cn|date=June 2021}}

==Career==
Working first in the [[Physical Chemistry]] Laboratory, he moved to the [[Dunn Nutritional Laboratory]], and in 1938 moved to Wool Industries Research Institution in [[Leeds]]. He was head of the [[biochemistry]] division of Boots Pure Drug Company from 1946 to 1948, when he joined the [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]]. There, he was appointed head of the physical chemistry division of the [[National Institute for Medical Research]] in 1952, and was chemical consultant from 1956 to 1959.

He specialised in biochemistry, in some aspects of [[vitamin]]s E and B<sub>2</sub>, and in techniques that laid the foundation for several new types of [[chromatography]].<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.19.070150.002505| pmid = 14771840| volume = 19| issue = 1| pages = 517–542| last = Martin| first = A J P| title = Partition Chromatography| journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry|year = 1950}}</ref> He developed [[partition chromatography]] whilst working on the separation of [[amino acid]]s,<ref>{{Cite journal| volume = 35| issue = 12| pages = 1358–1368| last1 = Martin| first1 = A J P| last2 = Synge| first2 = R L M| title = A new form of chromatogram employing two liquid phases A theory of chromatography. 2.

After his retirement from the University of Sussex, he was visiting professor at both the [[University of Houston]] in Texas and the [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|EPFL]] (École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne) in Switzerland.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2002-08-06|title=Archer Martin, 92; Chemist Won Share of Nobel Prize in 1952|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-aug-06-me-passings6.4-story.html|access-date=2021-06-03|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Nobel Winner Archer Martin Dies|url=https://apnews.com/article/5ed3f757479daeef349ca528117234a9|access-date=2021-06-03|website=AP NEWS}}</ref>

He published far fewer papers than the typical Nobel winners—only 70 in all—but his ninth paper contained the work that would eventually win him the Nobel Prize.  The [[University of Houston]] dropped him from its chemistry faculty in 1979 (when he was 69 years old) because he was not publishing enough.<ref name=nyt>{{Cite news|last=O'Connor|first=Anahad|date=2002-08-06|title=Archer Martin, Nobel Laureate in Chemistry, Dies at 92|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/06/world/archer-martin-nobel-laureate-in-chemistry-dies-at-92.html|access-date=2020-06-26|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Archer Martin's 1954 paper with A. T. James, "Gas-Liquid Chromatography: A Technique for the Analysis and Identification of Volatile Materials” reported the discovery of [[gas-liquid chromatography]]. This publication was honoured by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the [[American Chemical Society]] presented in 2016 to the Francis Crick Institute.<ref name="breakthrough">{{cite web|title=Citations for Chemical Breakthrough Awards 2017 Awardees|url=http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/HIST/awards/CCB-2017_Awardees.php|website=Division of the History of Chemistry|access-date=12 March 2018}}</ref><ref name="James">{{cite journal|last1=JAMES|first1=AT|last2=MARTIN|first2=AJ|title=Gas-liquid chromatography; a technique for the analysis and identification of volatile materials.|journal=British Medical Bulletin|year=1954|volume=10|issue=3|pages=170–6|pmid=13199288|url=https://academic.oup.com/bmb/article-abstract/10/3/170/264438?redirectedFrom=fulltext|access-date=12 March 2018|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.bmb.a069416}}</ref>
