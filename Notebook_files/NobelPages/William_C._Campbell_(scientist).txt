'''William Cecil Campbell''' (born 28 June 1930) is an Irish [[biologist]] and [[parasitologist]] with [[Citizenship of the United States|United States citizenship]], known for his work in discovering a novel therapy against infections caused by [[roundworm]]s, for which he was jointly awarded the 2015 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].<ref>{{cite news |title=William C Campbell, Satoshi Ōmura and Youyou Tu win Nobel prize in medicine |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/oct/05/william-c-campbell-satoshi-omura-and-youyou-tu-win-nobel-prize-in-medicine |access-date=5 October 2015 |work=The Guardian |date=5 October 2015}}</ref> He helped to discover a class of drugs called [[ivermectin]]s, whose derivatives have been shown to have "extraordinary efficacy" in treating [[Onchocerciasis|River blindness]] and [[Lymphatic filariasis]], among other parasitic diseases affecting animals and humans.<ref name=nobelprizeorg>{{cite web|title=The 2015 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine – Press Release: William C.

Campbell is best known for his work on parasitic diseases. Japanese microbiologist [[Satoshi Ōmura]] isolated and cultured many varieties of natural soil-based bacteria from the group [[Streptomyces]]. Campbell led a team at Merck in studying Ōmura's cultures and examining their effectiveness in treating parasites in domestic and farm animals. From the sample [[Streptomyces avermitilis]], naturally produced in soil, he derived macrocyclic lactone. After further modification, it was named ivermectin (generic) or Mectizan.<ref name=Merck>{{cite web|title=History|url=https://web.stanford.edu/group/parasites/ParaSites2005/Ivermectin/History.htm|website=Merck & Co., Inc.}}</ref>

In 1978, having identified a successful treatment for a type of worms affecting horses, Campbell realised that similar treatments might be useful against related types of worms that affect humans. In 1981, Merck carried out successful Phase 1 treatment trials in Senegal and France on river blindness.<ref name=nobelprizeorg/><ref name=Avril/> Taken orally, the drug paralyses and sterilises the parasitic worm that causes the illness.<ref name=NYT1987/> Merck went on to study the treatment of elephantiasis.
