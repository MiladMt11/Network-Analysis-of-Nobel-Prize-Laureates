'''Edward Adelbert Doisy''' (November 13, 1893 – October 23, 1986)<ref name=Doisy>{{cite web|title=Edward A. Doisy - Biographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1943/doisy-bio.html|publisher=Nobel Foundation|access-date=1 December 2017}}</ref> was an [[United States|American]] [[biochemist]]. He received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1943 with [[Henrik Dam]] for their  discovery of [[vitamin K]] (K from "Koagulations-Vitamin" in German) and its [[chemical structure]].

Doisy was born in [[Hume, Illinois]], on November 13, 1893. He completed his A.B. degree in 1914 and his M.S. degree in 1916 from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. He completed his Ph.D. in 1920 from [[Harvard University]].<ref name=Doisy/>

In 1919 he accepted a faculty appointment in the Department of Biochemistry at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], where he rose in rank to associate professor. In 1923, he moved to [[St. Louis University]] as professor and chairman of the new Department of Biochemistry. He served as professor and chairman of that department until he retired in 1965. [[St. Louis University]] renamed the department the E.A. Doisy Department of Biochemistry, in his honor.<ref name=Doisy/> More recently, the department has again been renamed. It is now known as the E.A. Doisy Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

In 1940, he was a lecturer in medicine at the [[University of Chicago]] [[University of Chicago Medical Center|School of Medicine]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Nobel Laureates|url=http://www.uchospitals.edu/about/awards/nobel.html|publisher=University of Chicago Medical Center|access-date=1 December 2017}}</ref>

He also competed with [[Adolf Butenandt]] in the discovery of [[estrone]] in 1930. They discovered the substance independently,<ref name=Doisy/> but only Butenandt was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1939.
