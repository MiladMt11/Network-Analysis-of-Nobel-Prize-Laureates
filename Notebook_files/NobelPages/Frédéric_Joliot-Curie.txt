'''Jean Frédéric Joliot-Curie''' ({{IPA-fr|fʁedeʁik ʒɔljo kyʁi|lang}}; né '''Joliot'''; 19 March 1900 – 14 August 1958) was a French [[physicist]] and husband of [[Irène Joliot-Curie]], with whom he was jointly awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1935 for their discovery of [[artificial radioactivity]].<ref name=formemrs>{{cite journal|last1=Blackett|first1=P.

== Biography ==

=== Early years ===
Born in Paris, France, Frédéric Joliot was a graduate of [[ESPCI Paris]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espci.org/fr/anciens/eleves/39/|title=Les ingénieurs de la 39e promotion de l'ESPCI|work=espci.org}}</ref> In 1925 he became an assistant to [[Marie Curie]], at the [[Curie Institute (Paris)|Radium Institute]]. He fell in love with her daughter [[Irène Joliot-Curie|Irène Curie]], and soon after their marriage in 1926 they both changed their surnames to Joliot-Curie.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1935/joliot-curie-bio.html|title=Irène Joliot-Curie – Biographical|publisher=Nobel Foundation|access-date=5 December 2017}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Rayner-Canham, Marelene F.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/191818978|title=A Devotion to Their Science: Pioneer Women of Radioactivity|date=1997|publisher=Chemical Heritage Foundation|isbn=978-0-7735-6658-3|location=Philadelphia, Pa.|oclc=191818978}}</ref> At the insistence of Marie, Joliot-Curie obtained a second [[baccalauréat]], a bachelor's degree, and a doctorate in science, doing his thesis on the electrochemistry of radio-elements.

=== Career ===
While a lecturer at the Paris Faculty of Science, he collaborated with his wife on research on the structure of the [[atom]], in particular on the projection, or recoil, of nuclei that had been struck by other particles, which was an essential step in the discovery of the [[neutron]] by Chadwick in 1932. In 1935 they were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for their discovery of "artificial radioactivity", resulting from the creation of short-lived [[radioisotope]]s by [[nuclear transmutation]] from the bombardment of stable [[nuclide]]s such as boron, magnesium, and aluminium with [[alpha particle]]s.

In 1937 he left the Radium Institute to become a professor at the [[Collège de France]]. In January 1939 he wrote a letter to his Soviet colleague [[Abram Ioffe]], alerting him to the fact that German physicists had recently discovered nuclear fission of uranium bombarded by [[neutron]]s, releasing large amounts of energy.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rSgfbK0hi2UC&q=ioffe|title=Dark Sun: The Making Of The Hydrogen Bomb|last=Rhodes|first=Richard|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2012|pages=27|language=en|isbn=9781439126479}}</ref> He went on to work on [[nuclear chain reaction]]s and the requirements for the successful construction of a [[nuclear reactor]] that uses controlled nuclear fission to generate energy. Joliot-Curie was mentioned in [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[Einstein–Szilárd letter|1939 letter]] to [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] as one of the leading scientists on the course to nuclear chain reactions. The [[Second World War]], however, largely stalled Joliot's research, as did his subsequent post-war administrative duties.

At the time of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] [[Battle of France|invasion in 1940]], Joliot-Curie managed to smuggle his working documents and materials to England with [[Hans von Halban]], [[Moshé Feldenkrais|Moshe Feldenkrais]] and [[Lew Kowarski]]. During the French occupation he took an active part in the [[French Resistance]] as a member of the [[National Front (French Resistance)|National Front]]. Collins and LaPierre in their book ''Is Paris Burning?'' note that during the [[Liberation of Paris|Paris uprising]] in August 1944 he served in the Prefecture of Police, manufacturing [[Molotov cocktail]]s for his fellow insurgents, the Resistance's principal weapon against German tanks. The Prefecture was the scene of some of the most intense fighting during the uprising.<ref name="Paris uprising">{{cite book|last1=Lapierre|first1=Dominique|last2=Collins|first2=Larry|title=Is Paris Burning?|date=1965|publisher=Warner Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0-446-39225-9|pages=107, 120}}<!--|access-date=20 April 2015--></ref>

A team of scientists and intelligence officers from the allied [[Alsos Mission]] later found Curie at the [[Collège de France]].  He was sent to England to be interviewed and gave important information about the names and activities of German scientists.

=== Post-war ===
He served as director of the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]], and appointed by [[Charles de Gaulle|Charles De Gaulle]] in 1945, he became France's first [[Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique|High Commissioner for Atomic Energy]]. In 1948 he oversaw the construction of the first [[Zoé (reactor)|French atomic reactor]]. He and Irène visited Moscow for the two hundred and twentieth anniversary of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Russian Academy of Science]] and returned sympathizing with "hard-working Russians".<ref name=":0" /> His affiliation with the Communist party caused Irène to be detained on [[Ellis Island]] during her third trip to the US, coming to speak in support of Spanish refugees, at the [[Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee|Joint Antifascist Refugee Committee's]] invitation. A devoted [[Communism|communist]], he was purged in 1950 and relieved of most of his duties, but retained his professorship at the [[Collège de France]]. Joliot-Curie was one of the eleven signatories to the [[Russell–Einstein Manifesto]] in 1955. On the death of his wife in 1956, he took over her position as Chair of Nuclear Physics at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]].

== Honours and awards ==
Joliot-Curie was a member of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] and of the Academy of Medicine and named a Commander of the [[Légion d'honneur|Legion of Honour]].

He was the recipient of the first [[Stalin Peace Prize]], given in 1951 for his work as president of the [[World Council of Peace]].

The crater [[Joliot (crater)|Joliot]] on the [[Moon]] is named after him. He was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1946|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1946]].<ref name="formemrs" /> He was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00001118 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200918200834/https://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00001118 |title=J.F. Joliot (1900 - 1958) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |archive-date=18 September 2020}}</ref>

A street in [[Sofia]], Bulgaria, and the nearby [[Joliot-Curie Metro Station]] are named after Frédéric Joliot-Curie. Other streets bearing his name can be found in the Rivière-des-Prairies borough of north [[Montreal]], Canada; in [[Bucharest]], [[Târgu-Mureș]], and [[Cluj-Napoca]], Romania; in [[Warsaw]] and [[Wrocław]], Poland; and in [[Poprad]], Slovakia.

Joliot-Curie appeared as himself in ''Kampen om tungtvannet'' (''La bataille de l'eau lourde'' in French; 1948), a French–Norwegian semi-documentary film about sabotage of the [[Vemork]] heavy water plant in Norway during World War II. His assistants Hans Halban and [[Lew Kowarski|Lev Kovarski]] also appear. Joliot-Curie is shown lecturing about nuclear fission and chain reaction at the Collège de France.<ref>{{IMDb title|id=0040504|title=Kampen om tungtvannet}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
[[File:Frederic and Irene Joliot-Curie.jpg|thumb|The Joliot-Curies in the 1940s]]
Frédéric and Irène hyphenated their surnames to Joliot-Curie after they married on 4 October 1926 in Paris, France, although their daughter has said, "Many people used to name my parents Joliot-Curie, but they signed their scientific papers Irène Curie and Frédéric Joliot."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/features/doe/2003-07/djna-mp071103.php|title=Marie & Pierre Curie's granddaughter, Hélène Langevin-Joliot, visits the United States|access-date=17 January 2007|publisher=Eurekalert.org}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

Joliot-Curie's daughter, [[Hélène Langevin-Joliot]], was born in 1927. She is a nuclear physicist and professor at the [[University of Paris]]. Her brother, [[Pierre Joliot]], was born in 1932. He is a biochemist at the [[Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique]].

Frédéric Joliot-Curie devoted the last years of his life to the creation of the [[Paris-Saclay Faculty of Sciences|Orsay Faculty of Sciences]] and a centre for [[nuclear physics]] at [[Orsay]],<ref name=":1" /> now part of [[Paris-Saclay University]], where his children were educated.
