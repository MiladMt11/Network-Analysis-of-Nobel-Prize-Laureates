==Early life==
Frans Eemil Sillanpää was born into a [[peasant]] farming family in [[Hämeenkyrö]]. Although his parents were poor, they managed to send him to school in [[Tampere]]. At school Sillanpää was a good student and with aid from his benefactor Henrik Liljeroos he entered the [[University of Helsinki]] in 1908 to study medicine.<ref name="AC" /><ref name="bio" /> Here his acquaintances included the painters [[Eero Järnefelt]] and [[Pekka Halonen]], composer [[Jean Sibelius]] and author [[Juhani Aho]].<ref name="AC">{{cite web |url= http://authorscalendar.info/fesillan.htm |title=Frans Emil Sillanpää (1888-1964)  |last1= Liukkonen |first1= Petri |date=2008 |website= Authors Calendar |access-date=2016-04-29}}</ref>

==Career==
Five years later, in 1913 Sillanpää moved from Helsinki to his old home village and devoted himself to writing.<ref>[http://global.britannica.com/biography/Frans-Eemil-Sillanpaa Frans Eemil Sillanpää] Encyclopædia Britannica</ref> In 1914 Sillanpää wrote articles for the newspaper ''[[Uusi Suometar]]''.<ref name="AC"/>  In 1916 Sillanpää married Sigrid Maria Salomäki, whom he had met in 1914.<ref name="AC" />

By principle, Sillanpää was against all forms of violence and believed in scientific optimism.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.saunalahti.fi/panu/kirj1.htm | title = Frans Emil Sillanpään sotavuodet | author = Rajala, Panu | access-date = 2017-11-11}}</ref> In his work he portrayed rural people as living united with the land.<ref name="AC"/>

The novel ''Hurskas kurjuus'' (Meek Heritage) (1919) depicted the reasons for [[Finnish Civil War]], and despite its objectivity, was controversial at the time.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2017/01/03/frans-emil-sillanpaa-hurskas-kurjuus-miksi-paadyimme-sisallissotaan | title = Frans Emil Sillanpää: Hurskas kurjuus – Miksi päädyimme sisällissotaan? | website = Yle | date = 2017-01-03 | access-date = 2017-11-11}}</ref>

Sillanpää won international fame for his novel ''Nuorena nukkunut'' (translated to English as ''The Maid Silja'') in 1931.

In 1939, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] "for his deep understanding of his country's peasantry and the exquisite art with which he has portrayed their way of life and their relationship with Nature."<ref name="NP">{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1939/sillanpaa-bio.html |title=Frans Eemil Sillanpää – Biographical |date= 2014 |website=Nobelprize.org |publisher=Nobel Media AB |access-date=2016-04-29 }}</ref> A few days after he received the prize, talks between Finland and Soviet Union broke down and the [[Winter War]] began.<ref name="bio" /><ref name="fes" /> Sillanpää donated the golden medal to be melted for funds to aid the war effort.<ref name="fes">{{cite web | url = http://www.fesillanpaanseura.org/nobel-palkinto | title = Nobel palkinto | website = fesillanpaanseura.org | access-date = 2017-11-11}}</ref>

Before the [[Winter War]], Sillanpää wrote the lyrics for what is known as ''[[Sillanpään marssilaulu]]'' to lift his spirits when his eldest son Esko was partaking in military practices at [[Karelian Isthmus]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tunturisusi.com/sotilasmarssit/sillanpaanmarssilaulu.htm | title= Sota-ajan musiikkia – Maailman Matista Sillanpään Marssilauluun | access-date=2017-11-10}}</ref>

In 1939 his wife Sigrid died of [[pneumonia]] leaving eight children with Sillanpää.<ref name="bio">{{cite web | url = https://kansallisbiografia.fi/kansallisbiografia/henkilo/700 | title = Sillanpää, Frans Emil (1888–1964) | website = Biografiakeskus | access-date = 2017-11-11}}</ref> Some time after, Sillanpää married his secretary Anna von Hertzen (1900–1983) and traveled to Stockholm to receive the Nobel prize.<ref name="bio" />

In 1941 Sillanpää divorced his wife Anna. His alcoholism and other ailments needed hospital treatment. In 1943 he returned to public life as a bearded old 'Grandpa Sillanpää'. His radio appearances, especially his tradition of talking on Christmas Eve from 1945 to 1963 became very popular.<ref name="KB">{{cite web |url=http://www.kansallisbiografia.fi/english/?id=700 |title=Sillanpää, Frans Emil (1888–1964) |website=The National Biography of Finland |publisher=SKS |access-date=2016-04-29 }}</ref>
