Borlaug was awarded multiple honors for his work, including the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] and the [[Congressional Gold Medal]].

Borlaug received his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in [[forestry]] in 1937 and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[plant pathology]] and [[genetics]] from the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1942. He took up an agricultural research position with [[CIMMYT]] in Mexico, where he developed semi-dwarf, high-[[crop yield|yield]], [[Phytopathology|disease]]-resistant [[wheat]] [[variety (biology)|varieties]].<ref name=natureobituary/><ref name=frs/> During the mid-20th century, Borlaug led the introduction of these high-yielding varieties combined with modern agricultural production techniques to Mexico, [[Pakistan]], and [[India]].

==Early life, education and family==
[[File:Wrestling - Norman Borlaug.jpg|thumb|Norman Borlaug wrestling at the [[University of Minnesota]]]]
Borlaug was the great-grandchild of [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] immigrants to the United States. Ole Olson Dybevig and Solveig Thomasdatter Rinde, of [[Feios]], a small village in [[Vik|Vik kommune]], [[Sogn og Fjordane]], Norway, emigrated to [[Dane County, Wisconsin|Dane County]], [[Wisconsin]], in 1854.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The family eventually moved to the small [[Norwegian-American]] community of Saude, near [[Cresco, Iowa|Cresco]], [[Iowa]]. There they were members of Saude Lutheran Church, where Norman was both baptized and confirmed.

Borlaug was born to Henry Oliver (1889–1971) and Clara (Vaala) Borlaug (1888–1972) on his grandparents' farm in Saude in 1914, the first of four children. His three sisters were Palma Lillian (Behrens; 1916–2004), Charlotte (Culbert; b. 1919) and Helen (b. 1921). From age seven to nineteen, he worked on the {{convert|106|acre|ha|abbr=on|adj=on}} family farm west of [[Protivin, Iowa|Protivin]], [[Iowa]], fishing, hunting, and raising corn, oats, [[timothy-grass]], cattle, pigs and chickens. He attended the one-teacher, [[one-room school|one-room]] New Oregon #8 rural school in [[Howard County, Iowa|Howard County]], through eighth grade.

Today, the school building, built in 1865, is owned by the Norman Borlaug Heritage Foundation as part of "Project Borlaug Legacy".<ref name=iowa>State Historical Society of Iowa. 2002. FY03 HRDP/REAP Grant Application Approval</ref> Borlaug was a member of the football, baseball and wrestling teams at Cresco High School, where his wrestling coach, Dave Barthelma, continually encouraged him to "give 105%".<ref>{{cite web|title=Father of the Green Revolution&nbsp;– He Helped Feed the World!|url=http://www.scienceheroes.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=68&Itemid=116}}</ref>

Borlaug attributed his decision to leave the farm and pursue further education to his grandfather's urgent encouragement to learn:  Nels Olson Borlaug (1859–1935) once told him, "you're wiser to fill your head now if you want to fill your belly later on."<ref>{{cite web|title=Iowa Rep. Tom Latham Pays Tribute to Dr. Borlaug |url=http://www.worldfoodprize.org/Press_room/2008/march/latham_borlaug.htm|publisher=The World Food Prize |access-date=18 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703155602/http://www.worldfoodprize.org/press_room/2008/march/latham_borlaug.htm |archive-date=3 July 2008 |date=20 March 2008}}</ref> When Borlaug applied for admission to the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1933, he failed its entrance exam, but was accepted at the school's newly created two-year General College. After two quarters, he transferred to the College of Agriculture's [[forestry]] program. As a member of University of Minnesota's varsity wrestling team, Borlaug reached the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] semifinals, and promoted the sport to Minnesota high schools in [[exhibition game|exhibition matches]] all around the state.

<blockquote>Wrestling taught me some valuable lessons &nbsp;... I always figured I could hold my own against the best in the world. It made me tough. Many times, I drew on that strength. It's an inappropriate crutch perhaps, but that's the way I'm made.<ref name=uom>University of Minnesota. 2005.{{cite web|url=http://www.coafes.umn.edu/Borlaug_and_the_University_of_Minnesota.html |title=Borlaug and the University of Minnesota |access-date=2005-06-18 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310043736/http://www.coafes.umn.edu/Borlaug_and_the_University_of_Minnesota.html |archive-date=2005-03-10 }}</ref></blockquote>

To finance his studies, Borlaug put his education on hold periodically to earn some income, as he did in 1935 as a leader in the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]], working with the unemployed on [[federal government of the United States|Federal]] projects. Many of the people who worked for him were starving. He later recalled, "I saw how food changed them&nbsp;... All of this left scars on me".<ref name=greengiant>[http://www.dallasobserver.com/2002-12-05/news/green-giant/ "Green Giant"]. Stuertz, Mark. ''Dallas Observer''. 5 December 2002.</ref> From 1935 to 1938, before and after receiving his [[Bachelor of Science]] in forestry in 1937, Borlaug worked for the [[United States Forest Service]] at stations in [[Massachusetts]] and [[Idaho]]. He spent one summer in the middle fork of Idaho's [[Salmon River (Idaho)|Salmon River]], the most isolated piece of wilderness in [[continental United States|the nation at that time]].<ref name=greengiant />

In the last months of his undergraduate education, Borlaug attended a [[Sigma Xi]] lecture by [[Elvin Charles Stakman]], a professor and soon-to-be head of the [[plant pathology]] group at the University of Minnesota. The event was a pivot for Borlaug's future. Stakman, in his speech entitled "These Shifty Little Enemies that Destroy our Food Crops", discussed the manifestation of the plant disease [[rust (fungus)|rust]], a [[parasitic]] [[fungus]] that feeds on [[phytochemical|phytonutrients]] in wheat, oats, and barley crops. He had discovered that special [[plant breeding]] methods produced plants resistant to rust. His research greatly interested Borlaug, and when Borlaug's job at the Forest Service was eliminated because of [[budget]] cuts, he asked Stakman if he should go into forest [[pathology]]. Stakman advised him to focus on plant pathology instead.<ref name=uom /> He subsequently enrolled at the university to study plant pathology under Stakman. Borlaug earned a [[Master of Science]] degree in 1940, and a Ph.D. in plant pathology and [[genetics]] in 1942.

Borlaug was a member of the [[Alpha Gamma Rho]] fraternity. While in college, he met his future wife, Margaret Gibson, as he waited tables at a coffee shop in the university's  [[Dinkytown#History|Dinkytown]], where the two of them worked. They were married in 1937 and had three children, Norma Jean "Jeanie" Laube, Scotty (who died from [[spina bifida]] soon after birth), and William; five grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren. On March 8, 2007, Margaret Borlaug died at the age of ninety-five, following a fall.<ref>{{cite web|title=Norman Borlaug's Wife Dies at 95 |url=https://www.kcrg.com/news/local/6373547.html |publisher=Associated Press |access-date=18 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923092556/http://www.kcrg.com/news/local/6373547.html |archive-date=23 September 2013 |date=8 March 2007 |quote=An assistant to the family says she fell recently and never recovered. |url-status=dead }}</ref> They had been married for sixty nine years. Borlaug resided in northern [[Dallas]] the last years of his life, although his global humanitarian efforts left him with only a few weeks of the year to spend there.<ref name=greengiant/>

==Career==
From 1942 to 1944, Borlaug was employed as a [[microbiologist]] at [[DuPont]] in [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]], [[Delaware]]. It was planned that he would lead research on industrial and agricultural [[bacteriocide]]s, [[fungicide]]s, and [[preservative]]s. However, following the December 7, 1941, [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] Borlaug tried to enlist in the military, but was rejected under wartime labor regulations; his lab was converted to conduct research for the [[United States armed forces]]. One of his first projects was to develop glue that could withstand the warm [[Seawater|salt water]] of the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]]. The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] had gained control of the island of [[Guadalcanal]], and patrolled the sky and sea by day. The only way for U.S. forces to supply the troops stranded on the island was to approach at night by speedboat, and jettison boxes of canned food and other supplies into the surf to wash ashore. The problem was that the glue holding these containers together disintegrated in saltwater. Within weeks, Borlaug and his colleagues had developed an adhesive that resisted corrosion, allowing food and supplies to reach the stranded Marines. Other tasks included work with [[camouflage]]; [[canteen (bottle)|canteen]] disinfectants; [[DDT]] to control malaria; and insulation for small electronics.<ref name=greengiant />

In 1940, the [[Manuel Ávila Camacho|Avila Camacho]] administration took office in [[Mexico]]. The administration's primary goal for Mexican agriculture was augmenting the nation's [[industrialization]] and economic growth. U.S. Vice President-Elect [[Henry A. Wallace|Henry Wallace]], who was instrumental in persuading the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] to work with the [[Mexican government]] in agricultural development, saw Avila Camacho's ambitions as beneficial to U.S. economic and military interests.<ref name=wright>Wright, Angus 2005. The Death of Ramón González.</ref> The Rockefeller Foundation contacted E.C. Stakman and two other leading agronomists. They developed a proposal for a new organization, the Office of Special Studies, as part of the Mexican Government, but directed by the Rockefeller Foundation. It was to be staffed with both Mexican and US scientists, focusing on soil development, maize and wheat production, and [[plant pathology]].

Stakman chose Dr. Jacob George "Dutch" Harrar as project leader. Harrar immediately set out to hire Borlaug as head of the newly established Cooperative Wheat Research and Production Program in Mexico; Borlaug declined, choosing to finish his war service at DuPont.<ref name=davidson>Davidson, M.G. 1997. [http://www.agbioworld.org/biotech-info/topics/borlaug/abundant.html An Abundant Harvest: Interview with Norman Borlaug, Recipient, Nobel Peace Prize, 1970], Common Ground, August 12</ref> In July 1944, after rejecting [[DuPont]]'s offer to double his salary, and temporarily leaving behind his pregnant wife and 14-month-old daughter, he flew to Mexico City to head the new program as a [[geneticist]] and [[Phytopathology|plant pathologist]].<ref name=greengiant />

In 1964, he was made the director of the International Wheat Improvement Program at El Batán, [[Texcoco, México|Texcoco]], on the eastern fringes of [[Mexico City]], as part of the newly established [[Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research]]'s [[International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center]] ''(Centro Internacional de Mejoramiento de Maíz y Trigo,'' or CIMMYT). Funding for this autonomous international research training institute developed from the Cooperative Wheat Research Production Program was undertaken jointly by the [[Ford Foundation|Ford]] and Rockefeller [[Foundation (charity)|Foundations]] and the [[Federal government of the United Mexican States|Mexican government]].

Besides his work in genetic resistance against crop loss, he felt that [[pesticide]]s including [[DDT]] had more benefits than drawbacks for humanity and advocated publicly for their continued use. He continued to support pesticide use despite the severe public criticism he received for it.<ref name="Borlaug-1974">{{cite journal | last=Borlaug | first=Norman E. | author-link=Norman Borlaug | date=1974 | title=In defence of DDT and other pesticides | journal=Pesticides | location=[[Bombay]] | volume=8 | number=5 | pages=14–19 | s2cid=53000872}} [[AGRIS]] id [http://agris.fao.org/agris-search/search.do?recordID=US201303170850 US201303170850].</ref><ref name="Rajaram-2011">{{cite journal | last=Rajaram | first=Sanjaya | author-link=Sanjaya Rajaram | title=Norman Borlaug: The Man I Worked With and Knew | journal=[[Annual Review of Phytopathology]] | publisher=[[Annual Reviews (publisher)|Annual Reviews]] | volume=49 | issue=1 | date=2011-09-08 | issn=0066-4286 | doi=10.1146/annurev-phyto-072910-095308 | pages=17–30 | s2cid=34962814}}</ref>

Borlaug retired officially from the position in 1979, but remained a CIMMYT senior [[consultant]]. In addition to taking up [[charitable organization|charitable]] and educational roles, he continued to be involved in plant research at CIMMYT with wheat, [[triticale]], [[barley]], [[maize]], and high-altitude [[sorghum]].

In 1981, Borlaug became a founding member of the [[World Cultural Council]].<ref>{{cite web | title = About Us | publisher = [[World Cultural Council]] | url = http://www.consejoculturalmundial.org/about-us/ | access-date = November 8, 2016}}</ref>

In 1984, Borlaug began teaching and conducting research at [[Texas A&M University]]. Eventually he was given the title Distinguished Professor of International Agriculture at the university and the holder of the Eugene Butler Endowed Chair in Agricultural [[Biotechnology]].

He advocated for agricultural [[biotechnology]] as he had for pesticides in earlier decades: Publicly, knowledgeably, and always despite heavy criticism.<ref name="Borlaug-2000">{{cite journal | last=Borlaug | first=Norman E. | author-link=Norman Borlaug | title=Ending World Hunger.

Borlaug remained at A&M until his death in September 2009.

==Wheat research in Mexico==
The Cooperative Wheat Research Production Program, a joint venture by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and the Mexican Ministry of Agriculture, involved research in [[genetics]], [[plant breeding]], plant pathology, [[entomology]], [[agronomy]], [[soil science]], and [[cereal]] technology. The goal of the project was to boost wheat production in Mexico, which at the time was importing a large portion of its grain. Plant pathologist George Harrar recruited and assembled the wheat research team in late 1944. The four other members were soil scientist William Colwell; maize breeder Edward Wellhausen; potato breeder [[John Niederhauser]]; and Norman Borlaug, all from the United States.<ref name=science1970>Brown, L. R. 1970. Nobel Peace Prize: developer of high-yield wheat receives award (Norman Ernest Borlaug). ''Science'', 30 October 1970;170(957):518–19.</ref> During the sixteen years Borlaug remained with the project, he bred a series of remarkably successful high-yield, disease-resistant, semi-dwarf [[wheat]].

[[File:Wheat field.jpg|thumb|[[Wheat]] is the third most-produced [[cereal]] crop.]]

Borlaug said that his first few years in Mexico were difficult. He lacked trained scientists and equipment. Local farmers were hostile towards the wheat program because of serious crop losses from 1939 to 1941 due to [[stem rust]]. "It often appeared to me that I had made a dreadful mistake in accepting the position in Mexico," he wrote in the epilogue to his book, ''Norman Borlaug on World Hunger''.<ref name=greengiant /> He spent the first ten years breeding wheat cultivars resistant to disease, including [[rust (fungus)|rust]]. In that time, his group made 6,000 individual crossings of wheat.<ref name=uommexico>University of Minnesota. 2005.{{cite web|url=http://www.coafes.umn.edu/Borlaug_s_Work_in_Mexico.html |title=Borlaug's Work in Mexico |access-date=2005-06-19 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041226212713/http://www.coafes.umn.edu/Borlaug_s_Work_in_Mexico.html |archive-date=2004-12-26 }}</ref>

===Double harvest season===
Initially, Borlaug's work had been concentrated in the central highlands, in the village of [[Chapingo]] near [[Texcoco, México|Texcoco]], where the problems with rust and poor soil were most [[prevalent]]. The village never met their aims. He realized that he could speed up breeding by taking advantage of the country's two growing seasons. In the summer he would breed wheat in the central highlands as usual, then immediately take the seeds north to the [[Yaqui Valley]] research station near [[Ciudad Obregón]], [[Sonora]]. The difference in altitudes and temperatures would allow more crops to be grown each year.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Borlaug's boss, George Harrar, was against this expansion. Besides the extra costs of doubling the work, Borlaug's plan went against a then-held principle of [[agronomy]] that has since been disproved. It was believed that to store energy for germination before being planted, seeds needed a rest period after harvesting. When Harrar vetoed his plan, Borlaug resigned. Elvin Stakman, who was visiting the project, calmed the situation, talking Borlaug into withdrawing his resignation and Harrar into allowing the double wheat season. As of 1945, wheat would then be bred at locations 700&nbsp;miles (1000&nbsp;km) apart, 10 degrees apart in latitude, and 8500&nbsp;feet (2600&nbsp;m) apart in altitude. This was called "shuttle breeding".<ref>{{cite news |last=Miller |first=Henry I. |title=Norman Borlaug: The Genius Behind The Green Revolution |date=January 2012 |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/henrymiller/2012/01/18/norman-borlaug-the-genius-behind-the-green-revolution |work=Forbes}}</ref>

[[File:Borlaug Mexico locations.png|thumb|300px|Locations of Borlaug's research stations in the Yaqui Valley and Chapingo]]

As an unexpected benefit of the double wheat season, the new breeds did not have problems with [[photoperiodism]]. Normally, wheat varieties cannot adapt to new environments, due to the changing periods of sunlight. Borlaug later recalled, "As it worked out, in the north, we were planting when the days were getting shorter, at low elevation and high temperature. Then we'd take the seed from the best plants south and plant it at high elevation, when days were getting longer and there was lots of rain. Soon we had varieties that fit the whole range of conditions. That wasn't supposed to happen by the books".<ref name=uommexico /> This meant that the project would not need to start separate breeding programs for each geographic region of the planet.

===Disease resistance through varieties of wheat===
Because [[purebred]] ([[genotype|genotypically]] identical) plant varieties often only have one or a few major [[genes]] for [[disease resistance]], and plant diseases such as [[Rust (fungus)|rust]] are continuously producing new races that can overcome a pure line's resistance, multiple linear lines varieties were developed.  Multiline varieties are mixtures of several [[phenotype|phenotypically]] similar pure lines which each have different genes for disease resistance.  By having similar heights, flowering and maturity dates, seed colors, and agronomic characteristics, they remain compatible with each other, and do not reduce yields when grown together on the field.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

In 1953, Borlaug extended this technique by suggesting that several pure lines with different resistance genes should be developed through backcross methods using one recurrent parent.<ref name=borlaug1953>{{cite journal | last1 = Borlaug | first1 = N.E. | year = 1953 | title = New approach to the breeding of wheat varieties resistant to ''Puccinia graminis tritici'' | journal = Phytopathology | volume = 43 | page = 467|id={{NAID|10018742476}} }}</ref> [[Backcrossing]] involves crossing a hybrid and subsequent generations with a recurrent parent. As a result, the genotype of the backcrossed progeny becomes increasingly similar to that of the recurrent parent. Borlaug's method would allow the various different disease-resistant genes from several donor parents to be transferred into a single recurrent parent. To make sure each line has different resistant genes, each donor parent is used in a separate backcross program. Between five and ten of these lines may then be mixed depending upon the races of pathogen present in the region. As this process is repeated, some lines will become susceptible to the [[pathogen]]. These lines can easily be replaced with new resistant lines.

As new sources of resistance become available, new lines are developed. In this way, the loss of crops is kept to a minimum, because only one or a few lines become susceptible to a pathogen within a given season, and all other crops are unaffected by the disease. Because the disease would spread more slowly than if the entire population were susceptible, this also reduces the damage to susceptible lines. There is still the possibility that a new race of pathogen will develop to which all lines are susceptible, however.<ref name=tnau>"AGB 301: Principles and Methods of Plant Breeding". Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.</ref>

===Dwarfing===
Dwarfing is an important agronomic quality for wheat; dwarf plants produce thick stems. The [[cultivars]] Borlaug worked with had tall, thin stalks. Taller wheat grasses better compete for sunlight, but tend to collapse under the weight of the extra grain—a trait called lodging—from the rapid growth spurts induced by [[nitrogen]] [[fertilizer]] Borlaug used in the poor soil. To prevent this, he bred wheat to favor shorter, stronger stalks that could better support larger seed heads. In 1953, he acquired a Japanese dwarf variety of wheat called [[Norin 10 wheat|Norin 10]] developed by the agronomist Gonjiro Inazuka in [[Iwate Prefecture]], including ones which had been crossed with a high-yielding American cultivar called Brevor 14 by [[Orville Vogel]].<ref name=reitz1970>{{cite journal | last1 = Retiz | first1 = L.P. | year = 1970 | title = New wheats and social progress | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 169 | issue = 3949| pages = 952–55 | doi=10.1126/science.169.3949.952| pmid = 5432698 | bibcode = 1970Sci...169..952R | s2cid = 21443218 }}</ref> Norin 10/Brevor 14 is semi-dwarf (one-half to two-thirds the height of standard varieties) and produces more stalks and thus more heads of grain per plant. Also, larger amounts of [[assimilation (biology)|assimilate]] were partitioned into the actual grains, further increasing the yield. Borlaug crossbred the semi-dwarf Norin 10/Brevor 14 cultivar with his disease-resistant cultivars to produce wheat varieties that were adapted to tropical and sub-tropical climates.<ref name=hedden>{{cite journal | last1 = Hedden | first1 = P | year = 2003 | title = The genes of the Green Revolution | journal = Trends in Genetics | volume = 19 | issue = 1| pages = 5–9 | pmid = 12493241 | doi=10.1016/s0168-9525(02)00009-4}}</ref>

Borlaug's new semi-dwarf, disease-resistant varieties, called Pitic 62 and Penjamo 62, changed the potential yield of spring wheat dramatically. By 1963, 95% of Mexico's wheat crops used the semi-dwarf varieties developed by Borlaug. That year, the harvest was six times larger than in 1944, the year Borlaug arrived in Mexico. Mexico had become fully self-sufficient in wheat production, and a net exporter of wheat.<ref name=uomgreenrev>University of Minnesota. 2005.{{cite web|url=http://www.coafes.umn.edu/The_Beginning_of_the_Green_Revolution.html |title=The Beginning of the Green Revolution |access-date=2005-06-22 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041227090100/http://www.coafes.umn.edu/The_Beginning_of_the_Green_Revolution.html |archive-date=2004-12-27 }}</ref> Four other high-yield varieties were also released, in 1964: Lerma Rojo 64, Siete Cerros, Sonora 64, and Super X.

In 1961 to 1962, Borlaug's dwarf spring wheat strains were sent for multilocation testing in the International Wheat Rust Nursery, organized by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]]. In March 1962, a few of these strains were grown in the fields of the [[Indian Agricultural Research Institute]] in Pusa, New Delhi, India. In May 1962, [[M. S. Swaminathan]], a member of IARI's wheat program, requested of Dr B. P. Pal, director of IARI, to arrange for the visit of Borlaug to India and to obtain a wide range of dwarf wheat seed possessing the Norin 10 dwarfing genes.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The letter was forwarded to the Indian Ministry of Agriculture headed by Shri [[C. Subramaniam]], which arranged with the Rockefeller Foundation for Borlaug's visit.

In March 1963, the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and the Mexican government sent Borlaug and Dr Robert Glenn Anderson to India to continue his work. He supplied 100&nbsp;kg (220&nbsp;lb) of seed from each of the four most promising strains and 630 promising selections in advanced generations to the IARI in October 1963, and test plots were subsequently planted at [[Delhi]], [[Ludhiana]], [[Pant Nagar]], [[Kanpur]], [[Pune]] and [[Indore]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Anderson stayed as head of the Rockefeller Foundation Wheat Program in New Delhi until 1975.

During the mid-1960s the [[Indian subcontinent]] was at war and experienced [[Famine in India#Bihar famine|minor famine and starvation]], which was limited partially by the U.S. shipping a fifth of its wheat production to India in 1966 & 1967.<ref name=science1970 /> The Indian and [[Pakistan]]i bureaucracies and the region's cultural opposition to new agricultural techniques initially prevented Borlaug from fulfilling his desire to immediately plant the new wheat strains there. In 1965, as a response to food shortages, Borlaug imported 550 tons of seeds for the government.<ref name=greengiant />

Biologist [[Paul R. Ehrlich]] wrote in his 1968 bestseller ''[[The Population Bomb]]'', "The battle to feed all of humanity is over&nbsp;... In the 1970s and 1980s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now." Ehrlich said, "I have yet to meet anyone familiar with the situation who thinks India will be self-sufficient in food by 1971," and "India couldn't possibly feed two hundred million more people by 1980."<ref>Erlich, Paul: The Population Bomb. 1968.</ref>

{{anchor|watts}} In 1965, after extensive testing, Borlaug's team, under Anderson, began its effort by importing about 450&nbsp;tons of Lerma Rojo and Sonora 64 semi-dwarf seed varieties: 250&nbsp;tons went to Pakistan and 200 to India. They encountered many obstacles. Their first shipment of wheat was held up in Mexican customs and so it could not be shipped from the port at [[Guaymas]] in time for proper planting.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Instead, it was sent via a 30-truck convoy from Mexico to the U.S. port in Los Angeles, encountering delays at the [[Mexico–United States border]]. Once the convoy entered the U.S., it had to take a detour, as the [[National Guard of the United States|U.S. National Guard]] had closed the freeway due to the [[Watts riots]] in Los Angeles. When the seeds reached Los Angeles, a Mexican bank refused to honor Pakistan treasury's payment of [[United States dollar|US$]]100,000, because the check contained three misspelled words. Still, the seed was loaded onto a freighter destined for [[Mumbai|Bombay]], India, and [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]]. Twelve hours into the freighter's voyage, war broke out between India and Pakistan over the [[Kashmir]] region. Borlaug received a [[telegram]] from the Pakistani minister of agriculture, [[Malik Khuda Bakhsh Bucha]]: "I'm sorry to hear you are having trouble with my check, but I've got troubles, too. Bombs are falling on my front lawn. Be patient, the money is in the bank&nbsp;..."<ref name=greengiant />

These delays prevented Borlaug's group from conducting the germination tests needed to determine seed quality and proper seeding levels. They started planting immediately and often worked in sight of [[artillery]] flashes. A week later, Borlaug discovered that his seeds were germinating at less than half the normal rate.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} It later turned out that the seeds had been damaged in a Mexican warehouse by over-fumigation with a pesticide. He immediately ordered all locations to double their seeding rates.<ref>{{cite web|title= Norman E. Borlaug, Ph.D. Biography and Interview |website=achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url= https://www.achievement.org/achiever/norman-e-borlaug/#interview}}</ref>

The initial yields of Borlaug's crops were higher than any ever harvested in [[South Asia]]. The countries subsequently committed to importing large quantities of both the Lerma Rojo 64 and Sonora 64 varieties. In 1966, India imported 18,000&nbsp;tons—the largest purchase and import of any seed in the world at that time. In 1967, Pakistan imported 42,000&nbsp;tons, and Turkey 21,000&nbsp;tons. Pakistan's import, planted on 1.5 million acres (6,100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), produced enough wheat to seed the entire nation's wheatland the following year.<ref name=science1970 /> By 1968, when Ehrlich's book was released, William Gaud of the [[United States Agency for International Development]] was calling Borlaug's work a "Green Revolution". High yields led to a shortage of various utilities—labor to harvest the crops, bullock carts to haul it to the threshing floor, [[jute]] bags, trucks, rail cars, and grain storage facilities. Some local governments were forced to close school buildings temporarily to use them for grain storage.<ref name=greengiant />

[[File:Wheat yields in Least Developed Countries.svg|thumb|300px|Wheat yields in [[least developed countries]] since 1961]]

In Pakistan, wheat yields nearly doubled, from 4.6 million [[metric ton|tons]] in 1965 to 7.3 million tons in 1970; Pakistan was self-sufficient in wheat production by 1968.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} Yields were over 21 million tons by 2000. In India, yields increased from 12.3 million tons in 1965 to 20.1 million tons in 1970. By 1974, India was self-sufficient in the production of all cereals. By 2000, India was harvesting a record 76.4 million tons (2.81 billion [[bushel]]s) of wheat. Since the 1960s, food production in both nations has increased faster than the rate of population growth.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} India's use of high-yield farming has prevented an estimated 100 million acres (400,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of virgin land from being converted into farmland—an area about the size of [[California]], or 13.6% of the total area of India.<ref name=cfgfi>Easterbrook, G. 1997. [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/01/forgotten-benefactor-of-humanity/306101/ ''Forgotten Benefactor of Humanity'']. The Atlantic Monthly.</ref> The use of these wheat varieties has also had a substantial effect on production in six [[Latin America]]n countries, six countries in the [[Near East|Near]] and [[Middle East]], and several others in Africa.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Borlaug's work with wheat contributed to the development of high-yield semi-dwarf ''indica'' and ''japonica'' [[rice]] cultivars at the [[International Rice Research Institute]] and China's Hunan Rice Research Institute. Borlaug's colleagues at the [[Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research]] also developed and introduced a high-yield variety of rice throughout most of Asia. Land devoted to the semi-dwarf wheat and rice varieties in Asia expanded from 200&nbsp;acres (0.8&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) in 1965 to over 40 million acres (160,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) in 1970. In 1970, this land accounted for over 10% of the more productive cereal land in Asia.<ref name="science1970" />

===Nobel Peace Prize===
For his contributions to the world food supply, Borlaug was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1970. Norwegian officials notified his wife in Mexico City at 4:00&nbsp;am, but Borlaug had already left for the test fields in the [[Toluca]] valley, about 40&nbsp;miles (65&nbsp;km) west of Mexico City. A chauffeur took her to the fields to inform her husband. According to his daughter, Jeanie Laube, "My mom said, 'You won the Nobel Peace Prize,' and he said, 'No, I haven't',&nbsp;... It took some convincing&nbsp;... He thought the whole thing was a hoax".<ref> {{Dead link|date=October 2021}} </ref> He was awarded the prize on December 10.

In his Nobel Lecture the following day, he speculated on his award: "When the Nobel Peace Prize Committee designated me the recipient of the 1970 award for my contribution to the 'green revolution', they were in effect, I believe, selecting an individual to symbolize the vital role of agriculture and food production in a world that is hungry, both for bread and for peace".<ref name=nobel>Borlaug, N. E. 1972. [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1970/borlaug-lecture.html Nobel Lecture, December 11, 1970]. From ''Nobel Lectures, Peace 1951–1970'', Frederick W. Haberman Ed., Elsevier Publishing Company, Amsterdam</ref> His speech repeatedly presented improvements in food production within a sober understanding of the context of [[World population|population]].  "The green revolution has won a temporary success in man's war against hunger and deprivation; it has given man a breathing space. If fully implemented, the revolution can provide sufficient food for sustenance during the next three decades. But the frightening power of human reproduction must also be curbed; otherwise the success of the green revolution will be ephemeral only.

"Most people still fail to comprehend the magnitude and menace of the "Population Monster"...Since man is potentially a rational being, however, I am confident that within the next two decades he will recognize the self-destructive course he steers along the road of irresponsible population growth..."<ref>{{cite web|title=Nobel Lecture&nbsp;– The Nobel Peace Prize 1970 Norman Borlaug|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1970/borlaug-lecture.html|website=nobelprize.org}}</ref>

===Borlaug hypothesis===
Borlaug continually advocated increasing crop yields as a means to curb deforestation. The large role he played in both increasing crop yields and promoting this view has led to this methodology being called by agricultural economists the "Borlaug hypothesis", namely that ''increasing the productivity of agriculture on the best farmland can help control deforestation by reducing the demand for new farmland''. According to this view, assuming that global food demand is on the rise, restricting crop usage to traditional low-yield methods would also require at least one of the following: the world population to decrease, either voluntarily or as a result of mass starvations; or the conversion of forest land into crop land. It is thus argued that high-yield techniques are ultimately saving [[ecosystem]]s from destruction. On a global scale, this view holds strictly true ''[[ceteris paribus]]'', if deforestation only occurs to increase land for agriculture. But other land uses exist, such as urban areas, pasture, or fallow, so further research is necessary to ascertain what land has been converted for what purposes, to determine how true this view remains. {{According to whom|date=March 2020}}

Increased profits from high-yield production may also induce cropland expansion in any case, although as world food needs decrease, this expansion may decrease as well.<ref name=cabi>Angelsen, A., and D. Kaimowitz. 2001.

CABI Publishing, New York</ref>

Borlaug expressed the idea now known as the "Borlaug hypothesis" in a speech given in Oslo, Norway, in 2000, upon the occasion of the 30th anniversary of his acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize: "Had the global cereal yields of 1950 still prevailed in 1999, we would have needed nearly 1.8 billion ha of additional land of the same quality – instead of the 600 million that was used – to equal the current global harvest".<ref>Borlaug, N. E. 2002. "The green revolution revisited and the road ahead". Stockholm, Sweden. Nobelprize.org. https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/borlaug-lecture.pdf</ref>

===Criticisms and his view of critics===
Borlaug's name is nearly synonymous with the [[Green Revolution]], against which many [[Green Revolution#Criticism|criticisms]] have been mounted over the decades by environmentalists and some nutritionists{{who|date=May 2019}}. Throughout his years of research, Borlaug's programs often faced opposition by nonscientists who consider genetic crossbreeding to be unnatural or to have negative effects.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Borlaug | first1=Norman |last2=Garrett |first2=Peter |author2-link=Peter Garrett |title=Between the Tynes / Chronicles of the Future&nbsp;– Program 6 Earth, wind & fire |newspaper=The Weekend Australian |date=December 18, 1999 }}</ref> Borlaug's work has been criticized for bringing large-scale [[monoculture]], [[intensive farming|input-intensive farming]] techniques to countries that had previously relied on [[subsistence farming]] to support smaller populations.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Leonard |first=Andrew |title=Show organic farmers the money |newspaper=Salon.com |date=July 16, 2007 |url=http://www.salon.com/2007/07/16/organic_farming_2/ }}</ref>{{failed verification|date=May 2019}} These farming techniques, in addition to increasing yields, often reaped large profits for U.S. [[agribusiness]] and [[agrochemical]] corporations and were criticized by one author in 2003 as widening social inequality in the countries owing to uneven food distribution while forcing a capitalist agenda of U.S. corporations onto countries that had undergone [[land reform]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Cockburn |first=Alexander |title=Corporate Interests Keep World's Poor Hungry |newspaper=[[Sunday Business Post]] |date=June 29, 2003 |url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2003/06/29/story909701237.asp |access-date=27 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112093059/http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2003/06/29/story909701237.asp |archive-date=January 12, 2010 }}</ref>{{synthesis inline|date=May 2019}}

Other concerns of his critics and critics of [[biotechnology]] in general include: that the construction of roads in populated third-world areas could lead to the destruction of wilderness; the crossing of genetic barriers; the inability of a single crop to fulfill all nutritional requirements; the decreased biodiversity from planting a small number of varieties; the environmental and economic effects of inorganic fertilizer and pesticides; and the side effects of large amounts of herbicides sprayed on fields of herbicide-resistant crops.<ref name=reason>[http://www.reason.com/news/show/27665.html "Billions served"]. Interview with ''[[Reason Magazine]]''. April 2000</ref>

Borlaug refuted or dismissed most claims of his critics, but did take certain concerns seriously. He stated that his work has been "a change in the right direction, but it has not transformed the world into a Utopia".<ref name=hoover>Herbert Hoover Presidential Library and Museum. 2002.{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/hoover.archives.gov/programs/4Iowans/Hurt.html |date=* |title=Four Iowans Who Fed The World, Norman Borlaug: Geneticist }}</ref> Of environmental lobbyists opposing crop yield improvements, he stated, "some of the environmental lobbyists of the [[Western world|Western]] nations are the salt of the earth, but many of them are [[elitist]]s. They've never experienced the physical sensation of hunger. They do their lobbying from comfortable office suites in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] or [[Brussels]]. If they lived just one month amid the misery of the developing world, as I have for fifty years, they'd be crying out for tractors and fertilizer and irrigation canals and be outraged that fashionable elitists back home were trying to deny them these things".<ref>{{cite news |last=Tierney |first=John |url=http://tierneylab.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/05/19/greens-and-hunger/?pagemode=print |title=Greens and Hunger |work=TierneyLab&nbsp;– Putting Ideas in Science to the Test |publisher=The New York Times |access-date=2009-02-13 |date=May 19, 2008}}</ref>

==Later roles==
Following his retirement, Borlaug continued to participate in teaching, research and activism. He spent much of the year based at CIMMYT in Mexico, conducting research, and four months of the year serving at [[Texas A&M University]], where he had been a distinguished professor of international agriculture since 1984. From 1994 to 2003, Borlaug served on the [[International Fertilizer Development Center]] board of directors. In 1999, the university's Board of Regents named its US$16 million Center for Southern Crop Improvement in honor of Borlaug. He worked in the building's Heep Center, and taught one semester each year.<ref name=greengiant />

===Production in Africa===
In the early 1980s, environmental groups that were opposed to Borlaug's methods campaigned against his planned expansion of efforts into Africa. They prompted the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations and the [[World Bank]] to stop funding most of his African agriculture projects. Western European governments were persuaded to stop supplying fertilizer to Africa. According to David Seckler, former Director General of the [[International Water Management Institute]], "the environmental community in the 1980s went crazy pressuring the donor countries and the big foundations not to support ideas like inorganic fertilizers for Africa."<ref name=cfgfi />

In 1984, during the [[Ethiopia]]n famine, [[Ryoichi Sasakawa]], the chairman of the Japan Shipbuilding Industry Foundation (now the [[Nippon Foundation]]), contacted the semi-retired Borlaug, wondering why the methods used in Asia were not extended to Africa, and hoping Borlaug could help. He managed to convince Borlaug to help with this new effort,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Press |first=Robert |title=Borlaug: sowing 'Green Revolution' among African leaders |journal=Christian Science Monitor |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/1994/0629/29091.html |access-date=2009-09-06|date=1994-06-29 }}</ref> and subsequently founded the Sasakawa Africa Association (SAA) to coordinate the project.

[[File:BorlaugUSEmbassy.jpg|left|thumb|Nigerian exchange students meet Norman Borlaug (third from right) at the World Food seminar, 2003.]]

The SAA is a research and [[Agricultural extension|extension]] organization that aims to increase food production in African countries that are struggling with food shortages. "I assumed we'd do a few years of research first," Borlaug later recalled, "but after I saw the terrible circumstances there, I said, 'Let's just start growing'."<ref name=cfgfi /> Soon, Borlaug and the SAA had projects in seven countries. Yields of maize in developed African countries tripled. Yields of wheat, [[sorghum]], [[cassava]], and [[cowpea]]s also increased in these countries.<ref name=cfgfi /> At present (more than ten years after Borlaug's death in 2009), program activities are under way in [[Benin]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Mali]], [[Malawi]], [[Mozambique]], [[Nigeria]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Uganda]], all of which suffered from repeated famines in previous decades.

From 1986 to 2009, Borlaug was the President of the SAA. That year, a joint venture between [[Carter Center|The Carter Center]] and SAA was launched called Sasakawa-Global 2000 (SG 2000).<ref name=SG2000>{{Cite web|author=The Carter Center |title=Norman Borlaug, Senior Consultant in Agriculture |url=http://www.cartercenter.org/health/agriculture/program_staff.html |access-date=2008-07-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821140453/http://cartercenter.org/health/agriculture/program_staff.html |archive-date=2008-08-21 }}</ref> The program focuses on food, population and agricultural policy.<ref name=CCAG>{{Cite web |author=The Carter Center |title=The Carter Center Agriculture Program |url=http://www.cartercenter.org/health/agriculture/index.html |access-date=2008-07-17 }}</ref> Since then, more than 8 million small-scale farmers in 15 African countries have been trained in SAA farming techniques, which have helped them to double or triple grain production.<ref name=CC25>{{Cite web | author=The Carter Center |title=Exhibit to Highlight Progress For Peace, Health, Human Rights |date=2007-05-02 |url=http://www.cartercenter.org/news/pr/anniversary_exhibit.html |access-date=2008-07-17 }}</ref> Those elements that allowed Borlaug's projects to succeed in India and Pakistan, such as well-organized market economies, transportation, and irrigation systems, are severely lacking throughout much of Africa, posing additional obstacles to increasing yields and reducing the ongoing threat of food shortages. Because of these challenges, Borlaug's initial projects were restricted to relatively developed regions of the continent.

Despite these setbacks, Borlaug found encouragement. Visiting [[Ethiopia]] in 1994 after a major famine, [[Jimmy Carter]] won Prime Minister [[Meles Zenawi]]'s support for a campaign seeking to aid farmers, using the fertilizer [[diammonium phosphate]] and Borlaug's methods. The following season, Ethiopia recorded the largest harvests of major crops in history, with a 32% increase in production, and a 15% increase in average yield over the previous season. For Borlaug, the rapid increase in yields suggested that there was still hope for higher food production throughout sub-Saharan Africa,<ref name=cfgfi /> despite lingering questions about population sustainability and the absence of long-term studies in Africa.

===World Food Prize===
The [[World Food Prize]] is an international award recognizing the achievements of individuals who have advanced human development by improving the quality, quantity or availability of food in the world. The prize was created in 1986 by Norman Borlaug, as a way to recognize personal accomplishments, and as a means of education by using the Prize to establish role models for others. The first prize was given to Borlaug's former colleague, [[M. S. Swaminathan]], in 1987, for his work in India. The next year, Swaminathan used the US$250,000 prize to start the [[MS Swaminathan Research Foundation]] for research on [[sustainable development]].

===Online education===
At the DuPont Agriculture & Nutrition Media Day held in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]], [[Iowa]], on September 25, 2000, Borlaug announced the launch of Norman Borlaug University, an Internet-based learning company for agriculture and food industry personnel. The university was unable to expand the necessary content or customer base, and since late 2001 has been defunct.

===Future of global farming and food supply===
The limited potential for land expansion for cultivation worried Borlaug, who, in March 2005, stated that, "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." With 85% of future growth in food production having to come from lands already in use, he recommends a multidisciplinary research focus to further increase yields, mainly through increased crop immunity to large-scale diseases, such as the rust fungus, which affects all cereals but rice. His dream was to "transfer rice immunity to cereals such as wheat, maize, sorghum and barley, and transfer bread-wheat proteins ([[gliadin]] and [[glutenin]]) to other cereals, especially rice and maize".<ref name=foodforthought>The Murugappa Group. 2005. [http://www.murugappa.com/news_events%5Cfeatures%5Cfood_for_thought.htm Food for Thought] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071227065949/http://www.murugappa.com/news_events/features/food_for_thought.htm |date=2007-12-27 }}</ref>

In 2005 in Kenya, Borlaug convened an international expert panel on the emerging threat of [[Ug99]] in east Africa, which eventually became the Global Rust Initiative. In 2008, the organization was named the [[Borlaug Global Rust Initiative]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Dr. Norman Borlaug|url=https://bgri.cornell.edu/dr-norman-borlaug/|access-date=2020-12-09|website=BGRI|language=en-US}}</ref>

Borlaug believed that [[GMO|genetically modified organisms]] (GMO) was the only way to increase food production as the world runs out of unused [[arable land]]. GMOs were not inherently dangerous "because we've been genetically modifying plants and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people were selecting the best breeds."<ref>[http://blogs.chron.com/sciguy/archives/2008/07/norman_borlaug_1.html Norman Borlaug: genetic modification can feed the world], Chron.com, July 13, 2008</ref>
In a review of Borlaug's 2000 publication entitled ''Ending world hunger: the promise of biotechnology and the threat of antiscience zealotry'',<ref>{{citation|last=Borlaug|first=N.E.|year=2000|title=Ending world hunger: the promise of biotechnology and the threat of antiscience zealotry|journal=Plant Physiology|volume=124|issue=2|pages=487–90|doi=10.1104/pp.124.2.487|pmid=11027697|pmc=1539278}}</ref> the authors argued that Borlaug's warnings were still true in 2010,<ref>{{citation|title=Global Food Security: The Role of Agricultural Biotechnology Commentary|url=http://www.plantphysiol.org/site/misc/pp160549.pdf|last1=Rozwadowski|first1=Kevin|first2=Sateesh|last2=Kagale|date=nd|institution=Saskatoon Research Centre, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada|location=Saskatoon, Saskatchewan|access-date=12 January 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924115318/http://www.plantphysiol.org/site/misc/pp160549.pdf|archive-date=24 September 2015}}</ref>

{{quote|GM crops are as natural and safe as today's bread wheat, opined Dr. Borlaug, who also reminded agricultural scientists of their
moral obligation to stand up to the antiscience crowd and warn policy makers that global food insecurity will not disappear without this new technology and ignoring this reality global food insecurity would make future solutions all the more difficult to achieve.|Rozwadowski and Kagale}}

According to Borlaug, "Africa, the former Soviet republics, and the [[cerrado]] are the last frontiers. After they are in use, the world will have no additional sizable blocks of arable land left to put into production, unless you are willing to level whole forests, which you should not do. So, future food-production increases will have to come from higher yields. And though I have no doubt yields will keep going up, whether they can go up enough to feed the population monster is another matter. Unless progress with agricultural yields remains very strong, the next century will experience sheer human misery that, on a numerical scale, will exceed the worst of everything that has come before".<ref name=cfgfi />

Besides increasing the worldwide food supply, early in his career Borlaug stated that taking steps to decrease the rate of [[population growth]] will also be necessary to prevent food shortages. In his Nobel Lecture of 1970, Borlaug stated, "Most people still fail to comprehend the magnitude and menace of the 'Population Monster'&nbsp;... If it continues to increase at the estimated present rate of two percent a year, the world population will reach 6.5 billion by the year 2000. Currently, with each second, or tick of the clock, about 2.2 additional people are added to the world population. The rhythm of increase will accelerate to 2.7, 3.3, and 4.0 for each tick of the clock by 1980, 1990, and 2000, respectively, unless man becomes more realistic and preoccupied about this impending doom. The tick-tock of the clock will continually grow louder and more menacing each decade. Where will it all end?"<ref name=nobel /> However, some observers have suggested that by the 1990s Borlaug had changed his position on population control. They point to a quote from the year 2000 in which he stated: "I now say that the world has the technology—either available or well advanced in the research pipeline—to feed on a sustainable basis a population of 10 billion people. The more pertinent question today is whether farmers and ranchers will be permitted to use this new technology? While the affluent nations can certainly afford to adopt ultra low-risk positions, and pay more for food produced by the so-called 'organic' methods, the one billion chronically undernourished people of the low income, food-deficit nations cannot."<ref name=population>Conko, Greg.

In 2006, the [[Government of India]] conferred on him its second highest civilian award: the [[Padma Vibhushan]].<ref>[http://ia.rediff.com/news/2006/aug/24borlaug.htm?q=np&file=.htm "Father of India's Green Revolution" given Padma Vibhushan] [[Rediff.com]], August 24, 2006.</ref> He was awarded the Danforth Award for Plant Science by the [[Donald Danforth Plant Science Center]], St Louis, [[Missouri]] in recognition of his lifelong commitment to increasing global agricultural production through plant science.

Several research institutions and buildings have been named in his honor, including: the Norman E. Borlaug Center for Farmer Training and Education, [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], [[Bolivia]], in 1983; Borlaug Hall, on the [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] Campus of the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1985; Borlaug Building at the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) headquarters in 1986; the Norman Borlaug Institute for Plant Science Research at [[De Montfort University]], [[Leicester]], United Kingdom in 1997; and the Norman E. Borlaug Center for Southern Crop Improvement, at Texas A&M University in 1999; and the Borlaug Institute for South Asia [https://bisa.org/ (BISA)] in 2011. In 2006, the Texas A&M University System created the Norman Borlaug Institute for International Agriculture{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} to be a premier institution for agricultural development and to continue the legacy of Dr. Borlaug.

The [[stained-glass]] ''World Peace Window'' at [[St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral (Minneapolis, Minnesota)|St. Mark's Episcopal Cathedral]] in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], depicts "peace makers" of the 20th century, including Norman Borlaug.<ref>Bjordal, J.

Retrieved 2009-09-06.</ref> Borlaug was also prominently mentioned in an episode ("[[In This White House]]") of the TV show ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]''. The president of a fictional African country describes the kind of "[[miracle]]" needed to save his country from the ravages of [[AIDS]] by referencing an American scientist who was able to save the world from hunger through the development of a new type of wheat. The U.S. president replies by providing Borlaug's name.

Borlaug was also featured in an episode of ''[[Penn & Teller: Bullshit!]]'', where he was referred to as the "Greatest Human Being That Ever Lived". In that episode, [[Penn & Teller]] play a card game where each card depicts a great person in history. Each player picks a few cards at random, and bets on whether one thinks one's card shows a greater person than the other players' cards based on a characterization such as humanitarianism or scientific achievement. Penn gets Norman Borlaug, and proceeds to bet all his chips, his house, his rings, his watch, and essentially everything he's ever owned. He wins because, as he says, "Norman is the greatest human being, and you've probably never heard of him." In the episode—the topic of which was genetically altered food—he is credited with saving the lives of over a billion people.<ref>{{cite episode |title=Eat This! |series=[[Penn & Teller: Bullshit!]] |airdate=April 4, 2003 |season=1 |number=11}}</ref>

In August 2006, Dr. Leon Hesser published ''The Man Who Fed the World: Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Norman Borlaug and His Battle to End World Hunger'', an account of Borlaug's life and work. On August 4, the book received the 2006 Print of Peace award, as part of International Read For Peace Week.

On September 27, 2006, the [[United States Senate]] by unanimous consent passed the Congressional Tribute to Dr. Norman E. Borlaug Act of 2006. The act authorizes that Borlaug be awarded America's highest civilian award, the [[Congressional Gold Medal]]. On December 6, 2006, the House of Representatives passed the measure by voice vote. President George Bush signed the bill into law on December 14, 2006, and it became Public Law Number 109–395.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ395.109|title=An Act To award a congressional gold medal to Dr. Norman E.
