'''Willis Eugene Lamb Jr.''' ({{IPAc-en|l|æ|m}}; July 12, 1913 – May 15, 2008) was an American [[physicist]] who won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1955 "for his discoveries concerning the fine structure of the hydrogen spectrum." The Nobel Committee that year awarded half the prize to Lamb and the other half to [[Polykarp Kusch]], who won "for his precision determination of the magnetic moment of the electron."  Lamb was able to determine precisely a surprising shift in [[electron]] energies in a hydrogen atom (see [[Lamb shift]]).  Lamb was a professor at the [[University of Arizona College of Optical Sciences]].

==Biography==
Lamb was born in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]], [[United States]] and attended [[Los Angeles High School]]. First admitted in 1930, he received a [[Bachelor of Science]] in Chemistry from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1934.  For theoretical work on scattering of neutrons by a crystal, guided by [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], he received the [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in physics in 1938.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://uanews.org/node/19760 | title=Willis E.

Lamb was a physics professor at [[Stanford]] from 1951 to 1956.<ref>[https://news.stanford.edu/news/2001/october3/nobel-other-103.html Stanford Report, "Other Nobel connections to the Farm," Oct. 3, 2001]</ref> Lamb was the [[Wykeham Professor]] of Physics at the [[University of Oxford]] from 1956 to 1962, and also taught at [[Yale]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]] and the [[University of Arizona]]. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1963.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter L|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterL.pdf|publisher=[[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]|access-date=22 April 2011}}</ref>

Lamb is remembered as a "rare theorist turned experimentalist" by D. Kaiser.<ref>D. Kaiser, ''Drawing Theories Apart: The Dispersion of Feynman Diagrams'' (University of Chicago, Chicago, 2005).</ref>

==Quantum physics==

In addition to his crucial and famous contribution to [[quantum electrodynamics]] via the [[Lamb shift]],  in the latter part of his career he paid increasing attention to the field of [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum measurements]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Fine Structure of the Hydrogen Atom by a Microwave Method|last=Lamb, Jr|first=W.

==Personal==
In 1939 Lamb married his first wife, [[Ursula Lamb|Ursula Schäfer]], a German student, who became a distinguished historian of Latin America (and assumed his last name).<ref>[[Andreas Daum]], Hartmut Lehmann, [[James J.

In 2008 he married Elsie Wattson.

Lamb died on May 15, 2008, at the age of 94,<ref name="Holley, Joe"/> due to complications of a gallstone disorder.
