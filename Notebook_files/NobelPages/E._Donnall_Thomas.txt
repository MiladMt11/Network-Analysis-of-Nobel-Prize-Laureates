==Biography==
Born in [[Mart, Texas|Mart]], [[Texas]], Thomas often shadowed his father who was a general practice doctor.
Later, he attended the [[University of Texas at Austin]] where he studied [[chemistry]] and [[chemical engineering]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1941 and an [[Master's degree|M. A.]] in 1943. While Thomas was an undergraduate he met his wife, [[Dottie Thomas|Dorothy (Dottie) Martin]] while she was training to be journalist. They had three children. Thomas entered [[Harvard Medical School]] in 1943, receiving an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] in 1946. Dottie became a lab technician during this time to support the family, and the pair worked closely thereafter. He did his residency at [[Peter Bent Brigham Hospital]] before joining the US Army. "In 1955, he was appointed physician in chief at the [[Mary Imogene Bassett Hospital]], now Bassett Medical Center, in Cooperstown, N.Y., an affiliate of [[Columbia University]]."<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/22/science/e-donnall-thomas-furthered-bone-marrow-transplants-dies.html?amp&_r=1& "E. Donnall Thomas, Who Advanced Bone Marrow Transplants, Dies at 92"]. ''The New York Times''. October 24, 2012.</ref>

At Mary Imogene Bassett, he began to study rodents that received lethal doses of radiation who were then saved by an infusion of marrow cells. At the time, patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation all died from infections or immune reactions that weren't seen in the [[animal testing on rodents|rodent studies]]. Thomas began to use dogs as a model system. In 1963, he moved his lab to the [[United States Public Health Service]] in Seattle.<ref name="Nature Obituary">{{Cite journal | last1 = Storb | first1 = R. | title = Edward Donnall Thomas (1920–2012) | doi = 10.1038/491334a | journal = Nature | volume = 491 | issue = 7424 | pages = 334 | year = 2012 | pmid =  23151572| bibcode = 2012Natur.491..334S | doi-access = free }}</ref>

Thomas also received [[National Medal of Science]] in 1990. In 2003 he was one of 22 Nobel laureates who signed the [[Humanism and Its Aspirations|Humanist Manifesto]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III/Notable_Signers | title=Notable Signers | publisher=American Humanist Association | work=Humanism and Its Aspirations | access-date=October 4, 2012}}</ref>
