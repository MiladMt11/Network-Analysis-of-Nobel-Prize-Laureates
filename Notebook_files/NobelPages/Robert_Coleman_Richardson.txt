Richardson was born in [[Washington D.C.]] He went to high school at [[Washington-Lee High School|Washington-Lee]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]]. He later described Washington-Lee's biology and physics courses as "very old-fashioned" for the time. "The idea of 'advanced placement' had not yet been invented," he wrote in his Nobel Prize autobiography. He took his first calculus course when he was a sophomore in college.<ref name="nytprint">{{cite news| last = Chang | first = Kenneth | date = 2013-02-22 | title = Robert C. Richardson, 75, Laureate in Physics, Dies | work = The New York Times | page = B14}}</ref>

Richardson attended [[Virginia Tech]] and received a B.S. in 1958 and a M.S. in 1960. He received his PhD from [[Duke University]] in 1965.
==Background==
At the time of his death, he was the Floyd Newman Professor of Physics at [[Cornell University]], although he no longer operated a laboratory. From 1998 to 2007 he served as Cornell's vice provost for research, and from 2007 to 2009 was senior science adviser to the president and provost. His past experimental work focused on using [[Nuclear Magnetic Resonance]] to study the quantum properties of liquids and solids at extremely low temperatures.

Richardson was an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]], and mentioned the Scouting activities of his youth in the biography he submitted to the Nobel Foundation at the time of his award.<ref name="NobelBio"/>

Richardson claimed that he did not believe in an [[Personal god|anthropomorphic God]], but it is unclear what specific beliefs he held.<ref>{{cite web | year =2011 | title = 50 Renowned Academics Speaking About God | volume = Part 1 | access-date = 2016-09-04 | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s47ArcQL-XQ  | quote = But, I do not believe in an anthropomorphic god... | editor =  Jonathan Pararajasingham}}</ref>
