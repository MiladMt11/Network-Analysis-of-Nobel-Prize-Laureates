==Life==

===Early years===
[[File:Landau1910.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Landau family in 1910]]
Landau was born on 22 January 1908 to [[Jew]]ish parents<ref name="frs"/><ref>[[Martin Gilbert]], ''The Jews in the Twentieth Century: An Illustrated History'', Schocken Books, 2001, {{ISBN|0805241906}} p. 284</ref><ref>''Frontiers of physics: proceedings of the Landau Memorial Conference'', Tel Aviv, Israel, 6–10 June 1988, (Pergamon Press, 1990) {{ISBN|0080369391}}, pp. 13–14</ref><ref>Edward Teller, ''Memoirs: A Twentieth Century Journey In Science And Politics'', Basic Books 2002, {{ISBN|0738207780}} p. 124</ref> in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]], in what was then the [[Russian Empire]]. Landau's father, David Lvovich Landau, was an engineer with the local oil industry, and his mother, Lyubov Veniaminovna Garkavi-Landau, was a doctor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://vestnikkavkaza.net/articles/Great-Baku-native-Lev-Landau.html|title=Great Baku native Lev Landau|website=Vestnik Kavkaza}}</ref> He learned  [[differential calculus]] at age 12 and [[integral calculus]] at age 13. Landau graduated in 1920 at age 13 from [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. His parents considered him too young to attend university, so for a year he attended the Baku Economical Technical School. In 1922, at age 14, he [[matriculation|matriculated]] at the [[Baku State University]], studying in two departments simultaneously: the Departments of Physics and Mathematics, and the Department of Chemistry. Subsequently, he ceased studying chemistry, but remained interested in the field throughout his life.

===Leningrad and Europe===
In 1924, he moved to the main centre of Soviet physics at the time: the Physics Department of [[Saint Petersburg State University|Leningrad State University]], where he dedicated himself to the study of theoretical physics, graduating in 1927. Landau subsequently enrolled for post-graduate studies at the [[Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute|Leningrad Physico-Technical Institute]] where he eventually received a doctorate in Physical and Mathematical Sciences in 1934.<ref>František Janouch, ''Lev Landau: A Portrait of a Theoretical Physicist, 1908–1988'', Research Institute for Physics, 1988, p. 17.</ref> Landau got his first chance to travel abroad during the period 1929–1931, on a Soviet government—[[People's Commissariat for Education]]—travelling fellowship supplemented by a [[Rockefeller Foundation]] fellowship. By that time he was fluent in German and French and could communicate in English.<ref>[[Yuriy Rumer|Rumer, Yuriy]]. [http://www.berkovich-zametki.com/AStarina/Nomer7/Rumer1.htm ЛАНДАУ]. berkovich-zametki.com</ref> He later improved his English and learned Danish.<ref name=bes>[[:ru:Бессараб, Майя Яковлевна|Bessarab, Maya]] (1971) [http://www.ega-math.narod.ru/Landau/Dau1971.htm Страницы жизни Ландау]. ''[[:ru:Московский рабочий|Московский рабочий]]''. Moscow</ref>

After brief stays in [[Göttingen]] and [[Leipzig]], he went to [[Copenhagen]] on 8 April 1930 to work at the [[Niels Bohr Institute|Niels Bohr's Institute for Theoretical Physics]]. He stayed there until 3 May of the same year. After the visit, Landau always considered himself a pupil of [[Niels Bohr]] and Landau's approach to physics was greatly influenced by Bohr. After his stay in Copenhagen, he visited [[Cambridge]] (mid-1930), where he worked with [[Paul Dirac]],<ref name="Mehra"/> Copenhagen (September to November 1930),<ref>During this period Landau visitied Copenhagen three times: 8 April to 3 May 1930, from 20 September to 22 November 1930, and from 25 February to 19 March 1931 (see [http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Landau_Lev.html Landau Lev biography – MacTutor History of Mathematics]).</ref> and [[Zurich]] (December 1930 to January 1931), where he worked with [[Wolfgang Pauli]].<ref name="Mehra">[[Jagdish Mehra|Mehra, Jagdish]] (2001) ''The Golden Age of Theoretical Physics'', Boxed Set of 2 Volumes, World Scientific, p. 952. {{ISBN|9810243421}}.</ref> From Zurich Landau went back to Copenhagen for the third time<ref>Sykes, J.

===National Scientific Center Kharkov Institute of Physics and Technology, Kharkov===
Between 1932 and 1937, Landau headed the Department of Theoretical Physics at the National Scientific Center [[Kharkov Institute of Physics and Technology]], and he lectured at the [[University of Kharkov]] and the [[Kharkov Polytechnical Institute]]. Apart from his theoretical accomplishments, Landau was the principal founder of a great tradition of theoretical physics in [[Kharkov]], [[Ukraine]], sometimes referred to as the "Landau school". In Kharkov, he and his friend and former student, [[Evgeny Lifshitz]], began writing the ''[[Course of Theoretical Physics]]'', ten volumes that together span the whole of the subject and are still widely used as [[Graduate school|graduate]]-level physics texts. During the [[Great Purge]], Landau was investigated within the [[UPTI Affair]] in Kharkiv, but he managed to leave for [[Moscow]] to take up a new post.<ref name=ScientificAmerican1997/>

Landau developed a famous comprehensive exam called the "Theoretical Minimum" which students were expected to pass before admission to the school. The exam covered all aspects of theoretical physics, and between 1934 and 1961 only 43 candidates passed, but those who did later became quite notable theoretical physicists.<ref>{{cite book|author=Blundell, Stephen J.|title=Superconductivity: A Very Short Introduction|year=2009|publisher=Oxford U.

In 1932, Landau computed the [[Chandrashekhar limit]];<ref>On the Theory of Stars, in ''Collected Papers of L. D.

===Institute for Physical Problems, Moscow===
[[File:1938-LandauL.jpg|thumb|left|Photo in prison, 1938-9|alt=]]
From 1937 until 1962, Landau was the head of the Theoretical Division at the [[Institute for Physical Problems]].<ref name=Dorozynsk/>

On 27 April 1938, Landau was arrested for a [[Korets-Landau leaflet|leaflet]] which compared Stalinism to [[German Nazism]] and [[Italian Fascism]].<ref name=ScientificAmerican1997>{{cite journal|title=The Top-Secret Life of Lev Landau|issue= 2 |pages= 72–77 |url= https://www.scientificamerican.com/magazine/sa/1997/08-01/ |url-access=subscription|last= Gorelik |first= Gennady |author-link= Gennady Gorelik|date= August 1997|journal= [[Scientific American]] |volume= 277 |access-date= 2018-06-18 |jstor= 24995874 |doi= 10.1038/scientificamerican0897-72 |bibcode= 1997SciAm.277b..72G }}</ref><ref>[http://www.kapitza.ras.ru/museum/history.htm Музей-кабинет Петра Леонидовича Капицы (Peter Kapitza Memorial Museum-Study)], ''Академик Капица: Биографический очерк (a biographical sketch of Academician Kapitza)''.</ref> He was held in the [[NKVD]]'s [[Lubyanka Building|Lubyanka prison]] until his release, on 29 April 1939, after [[Pyotr Kapitsa]], an [[experimental physics|experimental]] low-temperature physicist and the founder and head of the institute, wrote a letter to [[Joseph Stalin]] in which he personally vouched for Landau's behaviour and threatened to quit the institute if Landau were not released.<ref>[[Richard Rhodes]], [http://www.powells.com/biblio?show=TRADE%20PAPER:USED:9780684824147:9.50&page=excerpt ''Dark Sun: The Making of the Hydrogen Bomb''], pub Simon & Schuster, 1995, {{ISBN|0684824140}} p. 33.</ref>  After his release, Landau discovered how to explain Kapitsa's superfluidity using sound waves, or [[phonon]]s, and a new excitation called a [[roton]].<ref name=ScientificAmerican1997/>

Landau led a team of mathematicians supporting Soviet atomic and hydrogen bomb development. He calculated the dynamics of the first Soviet thermonuclear bomb, including predicting the [[Nuclear weapon yield|yield]]. For this work Landau received the [[State Stalin Prize|Stalin Prize]] in 1949 and 1953, and was awarded the title "[[Hero of Socialist Labour (USSR)|Hero of Socialist Labour]]" in 1954.<ref name=ScientificAmerican1997/>

Landau's students included [[Lev Pitaevskii]], [[Alexei Alexeyevich Abrikosov|Alexei Abrikosov]], [[Evgeny Lifshitz]], [[Lev Gor'kov]], [[Isaak Markovich Khalatnikov|Isaak Khalatnikov]], [[Roald Sagdeev]] and [[Isaak Pomeranchuk]].

===Scientific achievements===
Landau's accomplishments include the independent co-discovery of the density matrix method in quantum mechanics (alongside John von Neumann), the quantum mechanical theory of diamagnetism, the theory of superfluidity, the theory of second-order phase transitions, the Ginzburg–Landau theory of superconductivity, the theory of Fermi liquids, the explanation of Landau damping in plasma physics, the Landau pole in quantum electrodynamics, the two-component theory of neutrinos, the explanation of flame instability (the Darrieus-Landau instability), and Landau's equations for S matrix singularities.

Landau received the 1962 Nobel Prize in Physics for his development of a mathematical theory of superfluidity that accounts for the properties of liquid helium II at a temperature below 2.17 K (−270.98&nbsp;°C)."<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.2408530|title=Lev Davidovich Landau, Soviet physicist and Nobel laureate|journal=Physics Today|volume=57|issue=2|pages=62|year=2004|bibcode=2004PhT....57Q..62.}}</ref>

===Personal life and views===
In 1937, Landau married Kora T. Drobanzeva from Kharkiv.<ref name=y>[[Petr Leonidovich Kapitsa]], ''Experiment, Theory, Practice: Articles and Addresses'', Springer, 1980, {{ISBN|9027710619}}, p. 329.</ref> Their son Igor was born in 1946. Landau believed in "[[free love]]" rather than monogamy and encouraged his wife and his students to practise "free love". However, his wife was not enthusiastic.<ref name=ScientificAmerican1997/>

Landau was an atheist.<ref>{{cite book|title=Science and Christianity: Conflict Or Coherence?|year=2003|publisher=The Apollos Trust|isbn=9780974297507|author=Schaefer, Henry F. |page=9|quote=I present here two examples of notable atheists.

The Bukovsky Archives.</ref>

===Last years===
On 7 January 1962, Landau's car collided with an oncoming truck. He was severely injured and spent two months in a [[coma]]. Although Landau recovered in many ways, his scientific creativity was destroyed,<ref name=Dorozynsk>{{cite book |author=Dorozynsk, Alexander  |year=1965|title=The Man They Wouldn't Let Die}}</ref>  and he never returned fully to scientific work. His injuries prevented him from accepting the 1962 [[Nobel Prize for physics]] in person.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1962/press.html Nobel Presentation speech by Professor I. Waller, member of the Swedish Academy of Sciences]. Nobelprize.org. Retrieved on 28 January 2012.</ref>

Throughout his life Landau was known for his sharp humour, as illustrated by the following dialogue with a psychologist, [[Alexander Luria]], who tried to test for possible brain damage while Landau was recovering from the car crash:<ref name=bes>[[:ru:Бессараб, Майя Яковлевна|Bessarab, Maya]] (1971) [http://www.ega-math.narod.ru/Landau/Dau1971.htm Страницы жизни Ландау].

:Luria: "Please draw me a circle"
:Landau draws a cross
:Luria: "Hm, now draw me a cross"
:Landau draws a circle
:Luria: "Landau, why don't you do what I ask?"
:Landau: "If I did, you might come to think I've become mentally retarded".

In 1965 former students and co-workers of Landau founded the [[Landau Institute for Theoretical Physics]], located in the town of [[Chernogolovka]] near [[Moscow]], and led for the following three decades by [[Isaak Markovich Khalatnikov]].

In June 1965, Lev Landau and [[Evsei Liberman|Yevsei Liberman]] published a letter in the ''New York Times'', stating that as [[Soviet Jews]] they opposed U.S. intervention on behalf of the [[Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry]].<ref>Yaacov Ro'i, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vvfIq0aJ_1oC&pg=PA199 ''The Struggle for Soviet Jewish Emigration, 1948–1967''], Cambridge University Press 2003, {{ISBN|0521522447}} p. 199</ref>

===Death===
Landau died on 1 April 1968, aged 60, from complications of the injuries sustained in the car accident he was involved in six years earlier. He was buried at the [[Novodevichy cemetery]].<ref>[http://novodevichye.com/landau/ Obelisk at the Novodevichye Cemetery]. novodevichye.com (26 October 2008). Retrieved on 28 January 2012.</ref>

==Landau's ranking of physicists==

Landau kept a list of names of [[physicist]]s which he ranked on a logarithmic scale of productivity ranging from 0 to 5.<ref name="list"/> The highest ranking, 0, was assigned to [[Isaac Newton]]. [[Albert Einstein]] was ranked 0.5. A rank of 1 was awarded to the founding fathers of [[quantum mechanics]], [[Niels Bohr]], [[Werner Heisenberg]], [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], [[Paul Dirac]] and [[Erwin Schrödinger]], and others. Landau ranked himself as a 2.5 but later promoted himself to a 2. [[David Mermin]], writing about Landau, referred to the scale, and ranked himself in the fourth division, in the article "My Life with Landau: Homage of a 4.5 to a 2".<ref name="list">

==In popular culture==
* The Russian television film ''My Husband – the Genius'' (translation of the Russian title ''Мой муж – гений'') released in 2008 tells the biography of Landau (played by [[Daniil Spivakovsky]]), mostly focusing on his private life. It was generally panned by critics.  People who had personally met Landau, including famous Russian scientist [[Vitaly Ginzburg]], said that the film was not only terrible but also false in historical facts.
* Another film about Landau, ''[[DAU (project)|Dau]]'', is directed by [[Ilya Khrzhanovsky]] with non-professional actor [[Teodor Currentzis]] (an orchestra conductor) as Landau. Dau was a common nickname of Lev Landau.<ref name=dau>[http://orange.strf.ru/client/news.aspx?ob_no=7074 Дао Ландау] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007183002/http://orange.strf.ru/client/news.aspx?ob_no=7074 |date=7 October 2015 }}. strf.ru (25 January 2008)</ref>

A complete list of Landau's works appeared in 1998 in the Russian journal ''Physics-Uspekhi''.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Complete list of L D Landau's works |journal=Phys. Usp. |volume=41 |issue=6 |pages=621–623 |date=June 1998 |url=http://ufn.ru/en/articles/1998/6/k/references.html |doi=10.1070/PU1998v041n06ABEH000413|bibcode = 1998PhyU...41..621.}}</ref> Landau would allow himself to be listed as a co-author of a journal article on two conditions: 1) he brought up the idea of the work, partly or entirely, and 2) he performed at least some calculations presented in the article. Consequently, he removed his name from numerous publications of his students where his contribution was less significant.<ref name="dau"/>
