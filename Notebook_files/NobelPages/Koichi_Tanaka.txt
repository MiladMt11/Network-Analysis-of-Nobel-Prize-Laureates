{{nihongo|'''Koichi Tanaka'''|田中 耕一|Tanaka Kōichi|born August 3, 1959}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[electrical engineer]] who shared the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 2002 for developing a novel method for [[Mass spectrometry|mass spectrometric]] analyses of biological [[macromolecules]] with [[John Bennett Fenn]] and [[Kurt Wüthrich]] (the latter for work in NMR spectroscopy).<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Tanaka, K. |author2=Waki, H. |author3=Ido, Y. |author4=Akita, S. |author5=Yoshida, Y. |author6=Yoshida, T. |title=Protein and Polymer Analyses up to m/z 100 000 by Laser Ionization Time-of flight Mass Spectrometry |journal=[[Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry|Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom]] |volume=2 |issue=20 |pages=151–3 |year=1988|doi=10.1002/rcm.1290020802|bibcode=1988RCMS....2..151T }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jce.divched.org/JCEWWW/Features/eChemists/document.php?chemid=62 |title=Biographical Snapshots of Famous Women and Minority Chemists: Snapshot |access-date=2008-08-18 }}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Tanaka was born and raised in [[Toyama, Toyama|Toyama, Japan]], his biological mother died one month after he was born. Tanaka graduated from [[Tohoku University]] with a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering in 1983, afterward he joined [[Shimadzu Corp.|Shimadzu Corporation]], where he engaged in the development of mass spectrometers.<ref>{{cite book |author=Peter Badge |title=Nobel Faces |year=2008 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |isbn=978-3-527-40678-4 |page=[https://archive.org/details/nobelfacesgaller00badg/page/488 488] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/nobelfacesgaller00badg/page/488 }}</ref>

==Soft laser desorption==
[[File:Masatoshi Koshiba Junichiro Koizumi and Koichi Tanaka 20021011.jpg|thumb|left|200px|with [[Masatoshi Koshiba]] and [[Jun'ichirō Koizumi]] (at the [[Prime Minister's Official Residence]] on October 11, 2002)]]
For mass spectrometry analyses of a macromolecule, such as a [[protein]], the analyte must be ionized and vaporized by [[laser]] irradiation. The problem is that the direct irradiation of an intense laser pulse on a macromolecule causes cleavage of the analyte into tiny fragments and the loss of its structure. In February 1985, Tanaka found that by using a mixture of ultra fine metal powder in [[glycerol]] as a matrix, an analyte can be ionized without losing its structure. His work was filed as a patent application in 1985, and after the patent application was made public reported at the Annual Conference of the Mass Spectrometry Society of Japan held in [[Kyoto]], in May 1987 and became known as [[soft laser desorption]] (SLD).<ref>{{cite web | last =Markides | first =K |author2=Gräslund, A | title =Advanced information on the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2002 | url =http://nobelprize.org/chemistry/laureates/2002/chemadv02.pdf }}</ref>

However, there was some criticism about his winning the prize, saying that contribution by two German scientists, [[Franz Hillenkamp]] and [[Michael Karas]] was also big enough not to be dismissed, and therefore they should also be included as prize winners.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Nobel Prize controversy |journal=The Scientist |date=2002-12-11 |last=Spinney |first=Laura |url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/21791/title/Nobel-Prize-controversy/ |access-date=2014-06-04 |quote=Nobel Prize for Chemistry awarded amid protests that two of mass spectrometry's inventors overlooked }}</ref><ref name="GaultMcClenaghan2008">{{cite book|author1=Victor A.

</ref> Also Tanaka's SLD is not used currently for biomolecules analysis, meanwhile MALDI is widely used in mass spectrometry research laboratories. But while MALDI was developed prior to SLD, it was not used to ionize [[protein]]s until after Tanaka's report.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Karas M, Hillenkamp F |title=Laser desorption ionization of proteins with molecular masses exceeding 10,000 daltons |journal=Anal.
