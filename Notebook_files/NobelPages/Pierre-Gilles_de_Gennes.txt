==Education and early life==
He was born in [[Paris]], [[France]], and was [[homeschooling|home-schooled]] to the age of 12. By the age of 13, he had adopted adult reading habits and was visiting museums.<ref name="LifeinScience">{{Cite book| doi=10.1142/8182| title=Pierre-Gilles de Gennes: A Life in Science| publisher=World Scientific Publishing | isbn= 978-981-4355-25-4| year=2011| last1=Plévert| first1=Laurence}}</ref>
Later, de Gennes studied at the [[École Normale Supérieure]]. After leaving the ''École'' in 1955, he became a research engineer at the [[CEA Saclay|Saclay center]] of the [[Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique]], working mainly on [[neutron scattering]] and magnetism, with advice from [[Anatole Abragam]] and [[Jacques Friedel]]. He defended his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1957 at the [[University of Paris]].<ref>[http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/ins_dis/pierregilles_de_gennes.htm Selected bibliography on the College de France website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227073302/http://www.college-de-france.fr/default/EN/all/ins_dis/pierregilles_de_gennes.htm |date=2010-12-27 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.canalc2.tv/video.asp?idvideo=5667 Nature des Objets de mémoire : le cas de l'olfaction] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017142615/http://www.canalc2.tv/video.asp?idVideo=5667|date=2007-10-17}} conférence novembre 2006.{{in lang|fr}}</ref>

==Career and research==
In 1959, he was a [[postdoctoral research]] visitor with [[Charles Kittel]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and then spent 27 months in the [[French Navy]]. In 1961, he was assistant professor in [[Paris-Sud 11 University|Orsay]] and soon started the Orsay group on [[superconductors]]. In 1968, he switched to studying [[liquid crystal]]s.<ref>David Dunmur & Tim Sluckin (2011) ''Soap, Science, and Flat-screen TVs: a history of liquid crystals'', pp 183&ndash;8, [[Oxford University Press]] {{ISBN|978-0-19-954940-5}}</ref>

In 1971, he became professor at the [[Collège de France]], and participated in STRASACOL (a joint action of [[Strasbourg]], Saclay and ''Collège de France'') on polymer physics. From 1980 on, he became interested in interfacial problems: the dynamics of wetting and [[adhesion]].

He worked on [[granular material]]s and on the nature of memory objects in the brain.

==Awards and honours==
Awarded the [[Fernand Holweck Medal and Prize]] in 1968.

He was awarded the [[Harvey Prize]], [[Lorentz Medal]] and [[Wolf Prize]] in 1988 and 1990. In 1991, he received the [[Nobel Prize in physics]]. He was then director of the [[École Supérieure de Physique et de Chimie Industrielles de la Ville de Paris]] (ESPCI), a post he held from 1976 until his retirement in 2002.

P.G. de Gennes has also received the [[F. Albert Cotton#F.A. Cotton Medal for Excellence in Chemical Research|F.A. Cotton Medal for Excellence in Chemical Research]] of the [[American Chemical Society]] in 1997, the [[Holweck Prize]] from the joint French and British Physical Society; the Ampere Prize, French Academy of Science; the gold medal from the French CNRS; the Matteuci Medal, Italian Academy; the [[Harvey Prize]], Israel; and polymer awards from both APS and ACS.

He was awarded the above-mentioned Nobel Prize for discovering that "methods developed for studying order phenomena in simple systems can be generalized to more complex forms of matter, in particular to liquid crystals and polymers".

The [[Royal Society of Chemistry]] awards the [[De Gennes Prize]] biennially, in his honour.<ref name=RSC2014>{{cite web|title=de Gennes Prize|url=http://www.rsc.org/ScienceAndTechnology/Awards/deGennesPrize/Index.asp|website=Royal Society of Chemistry}}</ref> He was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1984|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1984]].<ref name=formemrs>{{cite web|title=Fellowship of the Royal Society 1660-2015|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RVVZY00MZNrK2YCTTzVrbTFH2t3RxoAZah128gQR-NM/pubhtml|publisher=[[Royal Society]]|location=London|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6a2i9QICV?url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RVVZY00MZNrK2YCTTzVrbTFH2t3RxoAZah128gQR-NM/pubhtml|archive-date=2015-07-15|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Joanny|first1=Jean-François|last2=Cates|first2=Michael|date=2019|title=Pierre-Gilles de Gennes. 24 October 1932—18 May 2007|journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society|volume=66|pages=143–158|doi=10.1098/rsbm.2018.0033|s2cid=127231807|doi-access=free}}</ref> He was awarded [[A.

Professors [[John Goodby]] and [[George William Gray|George Gray]] noted in an obituary:<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/jun/04/guardianobituaries.obituaries|title=Obituary: Pierre-Gilles de Gennes|last1=Goodby|first1=John|date=2007-06-04|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-08-08|last2=Gray|first2=George|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> "Pierre was a man of great charm and humour, capable of making others believe they, too, were wise. We will remember him as an inspirational lecturer and teacher, an authority on Shakespeare, an expert skier who attended conference lectures appropriately attired with skis to hand, and, robed in red, at the Bordeaux liquid crystal conference in 1978, took great delight in being inaugurated as a Vignoble de St Émilion."

In 2003 he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the [[Humanism and Its Aspirations|Humanist Manifesto]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III/Notable_Signers | title=Notable Signers | publisher=American Humanist Association | website=Humanism and Its Aspirations | access-date=October 1, 2012}}</ref>

On 22 May 2007, his death was made public as official messages and tributes poured in.<ref name=LifeinScience/>

On nuclear fusion he was quoted as saying, "We say that we will put the Sun into a box. The idea is pretty. The problem is, we don't know how to make the box."
