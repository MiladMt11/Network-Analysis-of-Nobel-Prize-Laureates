'''Martin Rodbell''' (December 1, 1925<ref name="nobelprize">{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1994/rodbell-autobio.html|title=Martin Rodbell - Biographical|publisher=nobelprize.org|access-date=2015-05-15}}</ref> – December 7, 1998) was an American [[biochemist]] and [[molecular]] [[endocrinologist]] who is best known for his discovery of [[G-protein]]s. He shared the 1994 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] with [[Alfred G. Gilman]] for "their discovery of G-proteins and the role of these proteins in signal transduction in cells."

==Biography==
Rodbell was born in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], the son of Shirley (née Abrams) and Milton Rodbell, a grocer.<ref name="google">{{cite book|title=American National Biography: Supplement 2|author1=Betz, P.R.|author2=Carnes, M.C.|author3=American Council of Learned Societies|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=9780195222029|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wZczV8ZxgL4C|page=478|access-date=2015-05-15}}</ref> His family was Jewish.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washington.edu/alumni/columns/june96/rodbell2.html|title=The 'G' Man - From Grocery Delivery Boy to the U-Dub|website=www.washington.edu|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref> After graduating from the [[Baltimore City College]] high school, he entered [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1943, with interests in [[biology]] and [[existentialism|French existential literature]]. In 1944, his studies were interrupted by his military service as a [[U.S. Navy]] [[radio]] operator during [[World War II]]. He returned to Hopkins in 1946 and received his B.S. in biology in 1949. In 1950, he married [[People associated with Anne Frank#Friends and extended family|Barbara Charlotte Ledermann]], a former friend of the legendary diarist [[Anne Frank]], with whom he had four children. Rodbell received his Ph.D. in [[biochemistry]] at the [[University of Washington]] in 1954. He did post-doctoral work at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] from 1954 to 1956. In 1956, Rodbell accepted a position as a research biochemist at the National Heart Institute, part of the [[National Institutes of Health]], in [[Bethesda, Maryland]]. In 1985, Rodbell became Scientific Director of the NIH's National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences in [[Research Triangle Park, North Carolina]] where he worked until his retirement in 1994. He was also Adjunct Professor of Cell Biology at [[Duke University]] (from 1991 to 1998)<ref>''Bulletins of Duke University'' (from 1991 to 1998), published by [[Duke University]]</ref> and Adjunct Professor of Pharmacology at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Nobel Laureate Martin Rodbell Dies|journal=[[Environmental Health Perspectives]]|date=January 1999|volume=107|issue=1|page=A9|pmc=1566302|doi=10.1289/ehp.99107a9|pmid=9872722}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Barnes|first1=Bart|title=Nobel Winner Martin Rodbell Dies|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/local/1998/12/11/nobel-winner-martin-rodbell-dies/9f0cd772-0112-4b59-b57d-964100fcfda9/|access-date=31 December 2015|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=December 11, 1998}}</ref> He died in Chapel Hill of multiple organ failure after an extended illness.

===Research===
Reflecting the increasingly common analogies between [[computer science]] and [[biology]] in the 1960s, Rodbell believed that the fundamental information processing systems of both computers and biological [[organism]]s were similar. He asserted that individual cells were analogous to cybernetic systems made up of three distinct molecular components: discriminators, [[transducer]]s, and [[amplifier]]s (otherwise known as effectors). The discriminator, or cell [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]], receives information from outside the cell; a cell [[transduction (physiology)|transducer]] processes this information across the [[cell membrane]]; and the amplifier intensifies these signals to initiate reactions within the cell or to transmit information to other cells.

In December 1969 and early January 1970, Rodbell was working with a laboratory team that studied the effect of the hormone [[glucagon]] on a rat [[liver]] membrane receptor—the cellular discriminator that receives outside signals. Rodbell discovered that ATP ([[adenosine triphosphate]]) could reverse the binding action of glucagon to the cell receptor and thus dissociate the glucagon from the cell altogether. He then noted that traces of GTP ([[guanosine triphosphate]]) could reverse the binding process almost one thousand times faster than ATP. Rodbell deduced that GTP was probably the active biological factor in dissociating glucagon from the cell's receptor, and that GTP had been present as an impurity in his earlier experiments with ATP. This GTP, he found, stimulated the activity in the guanine nucleotide protein (later called the G-protein), which, in turn, produced profound metabolic effects in the cell. This activation of the G-protein, Rodbell postulated, was the "[[second messenger]]" process that [[Earl W. Sutherland]] had theorized. In the language of signal transduction, the G-protein, activated by GTP, was the principal component of the transducer, which was the crucial link between the discriminator and the amplifier. Later, Rodbell postulated, and then provided evidence for, additional G-proteins at the cell receptor that could inhibit and activate transduction, often at the same time. In other words, cellular receptors were sophisticated enough to have several different processes going on simultaneously.

===Rodbell's personal philosophy of science===

He concluded his formal written Nobel Lecture with this poem:<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/rodbell-lecture.pdf Nobel Lecture, December 8, 1994, by Martin Rodbell]</ref><blockquote>To my Friends:Thoughts from “On High”

Life on a roller coaster, oscillating from hither to yon,
no respite for the iconoclast, wandering from dusk to dawn.
Conjuring strange thoughts foreign and twice forbidden,
like Prometheus unbound, this Nobelist climbs in vain
to Andean peaks, seeking what most would proclaim insane.
Why, he ponders, are there no answers to protean questions
when others thinking cleanly and simply with Occam’s sharp razor
proclaim what seems obvious given the beam of their unerring laser.
Nature, happily unfettered with philosophy, or with cunning, or with intent
moves relentlessly onward or even backward with energy unspent
while we mortals test and probe with twinkling machines blinking precisely
at each movement, striving to unravel its irresolute randomness, its fathomless,
unlimited, meaningless rush into spiraling chaos,
oblivious of its multitudinous trials & errors which we pontifically believe
must be unerring truth & resolution.

The laugh is on those who, burdened with pretensions of truth, believe they
can fathom within 15 minutes of human existence what has transpired over
eons of space and time in this Universe .
So, I extol the intuitions encapsulated in the folds of my mind
from whence occasionally they hurtle to the forebrain and in a twinkling of
a proton’s discharge bring to fruition a thought, an idea borne on the feathery
appendages of teeming neurons wedded in a seamless synergy. Those
fleeting moments are cherished as are those precious impulses imparted by
the innumerable individuals who nurtured and instilled unknowingly their
encrypted thoughts in mine.

So, with these fanciful thoughts in mind I give praise to you - my friends, my colleagues, my soul-mates, my loved ones - for letting my soul and thoughts meander hither and yonder in this attempt at philosophy and poetry. We now belong to the Gods on high who praise us for our frailties and our achievements.</blockquote>
