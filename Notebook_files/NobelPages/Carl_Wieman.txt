Wieman currently holds a joint appointment as Professor of Physics and Professor in the [[Stanford Graduate School of Education]], as well as the DRC Professor in the [[Stanford University School of Engineering]]. In 2020, Wieman was awarded the Yidan Prize in Education Research for "his contribution in developing new techniques and tools in STEM education."

He was awarded the [[Lorentz Medal]] in 1998. In 2001, he won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], along with [[Eric Allin Cornell]] and [[Wolfgang Ketterle]], for fundamental studies of the Bose-Einstein condensate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2001/public.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-06-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611044641/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2001/public.html |archive-date=2011-06-11 }}</ref> In 2004, he was named United States Professor of the Year among all doctoral and research universities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.usprofessorsoftheyear.org/Winners/Previous_Natl_Winners/2004_National_Winners.html|title=U.S Professor of the Year Awards - 2004 National Winners|website=www.usprofessorsoftheyear.org|access-date=2018-10-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181005195054/http://www.usprofessorsoftheyear.org/Winners/Previous_Natl_Winners/2004_National_Winners.html|archive-date=2018-10-05|url-status=dead}}</ref> 

In a 2020 interview given to [[Federal University of Pará]] in Brazil, Wieman recalls his youth and his journey as a physicist; the influence of other people, like teachers and his parents, on his trajectory; his path through science education and the foundation of the open educational resource [[PhET Interactive Simulations]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Interview with Carl E.

Wieman joined the [[University of British Columbia]] on 1 January 2007 and headed a well-endowed science education initiative there; he retained a twenty percent appointment at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]] to head the science education project he founded in Colorado.<ref>{{cite press release | title=CU-Boulder Nobel Laureate Carl Wieman Announces Move To British Columbia, Will Remain Linked To CU-Boulder | url=http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2006/109.html | publisher=University of Colorado Boulder | date=2006-03-20 | access-date=2007-10-09 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906175831/http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2006/109.html | archive-date=2008-09-06 }}</ref> On 1 September 2013, Wieman joined [[Stanford University]] with a joint appointment in the physics department and the Graduate School of Education.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://news.sciencemag.org/education/2013/08/carl-wieman-takes-physics-education-jobs-stanford |title = Carl Wieman Takes Physics, Education Jobs at Stanford|date = 2013-08-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | url=https://chronicle.com/article/Nobelist-Carl-Wieman-Moves-to/141269/ |title = Nobelist Carl Wieman Moves to Stanford to Focus on Better Science Teaching|journal = The Chronicle of Higher Education|date = 2013-08-27}}</ref>

In the past several years, Wieman has been particularly involved with efforts at improving [[science education]] and has conducted educational research on science instruction. Wieman served as Chair of the [[Board on Science Education]] of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] from 2005 to 2009. He has used and promotes [[Eric Mazur]]'s [[peer instruction]], a pedagogical system where teachers repeatedly ask [[Multiple choice|multiple-choice]] concept questions during class, and students reply on the spot with little wireless "clicker" devices. If a large proportion of the class chooses a wrong answer, students discuss among themselves and reply again.<ref>{{cite news | author=David Epstein | title=Trading Research for Teaching | url=http://insidehighered.com/news/2006/04/07/wieman | work=Inside Higher Ed | date=2006-04-07 | access-date=2007-10-09}}</ref> In 2007, Wieman was awarded the [[Oersted Medal]], which recognizes notable contributions to the teaching of physics, by the [[American Association of Physics Teachers]] (AAPT).

Wieman is the founder and chairman of [[PhET]], a web-based directive of [[University of Colorado Boulder]] which provides an extensive suite of simulations to improve the way that physics, chemistry, biology, earth science and math are taught and learned.<ref>{{Cite book | doi=10.1142/9789812813787_0097| chapter=PhET: Interactive Simulations for Teaching and Learning Physics| title=Collected Papers of Carl Wieman| pages=702–709| year=2008| last1=Perkins| first1=Katherine| last2=Adams| first2=Wendy| last3=Dubson| first3=Michael| last4=Finkelstein| first4=Noah| last5=Reid| first5=Sam| last6=Wieman| first6=Carl| last7=Lemaster| first7=Ron| isbn=978-981-270-415-3}}</ref>  [https://web.archive.org/web/20100405121036/http://phet.colorado.edu/index.php Link]

His hearing in front of the Commerce committee occurred on May 20, 2010 and he was passed by unanimous consent.  On September 16, 2010 Dr. Wieman was confirmed by unanimous consent. He left that post in June 2012 to battle [[multiple myeloma]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://news.sciencemag.org/education/2013/08/carl-wieman-takes-physics-education-jobs-stanford |title = Carl Wieman Takes Physics, Education Jobs at Stanford|date = 2013-08-28}}</ref>
