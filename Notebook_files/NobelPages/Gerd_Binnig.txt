'''Gerd Binnig''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡɛʁt ˈbɪnɪç|-|De-Gerd Binnig.ogg}}; born 20 July 1947<ref name="nobelbio">{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1986/binnig-bio.html|title=Gerd Binnig - Biographical|publisher=Nobel Media AB|year=1986|access-date=2014-01-01}}</ref>) is a [[German people|German]] physicist. He is most famous for having won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] jointly with [[Heinrich Rohrer]] in 1986 for the invention of the [[scanning tunneling microscope]].<ref name="nobelPR">{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1986/press.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1986 - Press Release|publisher=Nobel Media AB|date=1986-10-15|access-date=2014-01-01}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Binnig was born in [[Frankfurt am Main]] and played in the ruins of the city during his childhood. His family lived partly in [[Frankfurt]] and partly in [[Offenbach am Main]], and he attended school in both cities. At the age of 10, he decided to become a physicist, but he soon wondered whether he had made the right choice. He concentrated more on music, playing in a band. He also started playing the violin at 15 and played in his school orchestra.<ref name="nobelbio" />

Binnig studied physics at the [[Goethe University Frankfurt|J.W. Goethe University]] in Frankfurt, gaining a bachelor's degree in 1973 and remaining there to do a PhD with in Werner Martienssen's group, supervised by Eckhardt Hoenig.<ref name="DefiniensBiog">{{cite web|url=http://www.definiens.com/about-definiens/our-company/management-team.html|title=Definiens Management Team - Gerd Binnig, PhD|access-date=2014-01-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102195823/http://www.definiens.com/about-definiens/our-company/management-team.html|archive-date=2014-01-02|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Career==
In 1978, Binnig accepted an offer from [[IBM]] to join their [[Zürich]] research group, where he worked with [[Heinrich Rohrer]], [[Christoph Gerber]] and [[Edmund Weibel]]. There they developed the [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM), an instrument for imaging surfaces at the atomic level.<ref name="Binnig1982">
{{cite journal|last1=Binnig|first1= G. |title=Surface Studies by Scanning Tunneling Microscopy|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=49 |issue=1 |page=57|year=1982|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.49.57|last2=Rohrer|first2=H.|last3=Gerbe |first3=Ch |last4=Weibe |first4=E. |bibcode = 1982PhRvL..49...57B |doi-access=free}}</ref>
The Nobel committee described the effect that the invention of the STM had on science, saying that "entirely new fields are opening up for the study of the structure of matter."<ref name="nobelPR" />  The physical principles on which the STM was based were already known before the IBM team developed the STM, but Binnig and his colleagues were the first to solve the significant experimental challenges involved in putting it into effect.<ref name="nobelPR" />

The IBM Zürich team were soon recognized with a number of prizes: the German Physics Prize, the Otto Klung Prize, the Hewlett Packard Prize and the King Faisal Prize.<ref name="nobelbio" /> 
In 1986, Binnig and Rohrer shared half of the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], the other half of the Prize was awarded to [[Ernst Ruska]].

From 1985-1988, he worked in California. He was at IBM in [[Almaden Valley, San Jose, California|Almaden Valley]], and was visiting professor at [[Stanford University]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Gerd Binnig|url=http://www.kavliprize.org/prizes-and-laureates/laureates/gerd-binnig|website=kavliprize.org|access-date=30 May 2017|date=2016-06-02}}</ref>

In 1985, Binnig invented the [[Atomic force microscopy|atomic force microscope]] (AFM)<ref>G. Binnig, "Atomic force microscope and method for imaging surfaces with atomic resolution", US Patent US4724318 (priority date Nov 25 1985)</ref> and Binnig, [[Christoph Gerber]] and [[Calvin Quate]] went on to develop a working version of this new microscope for insulating surfaces.<ref name="BinnigQuate1986">{{cite journal|last1=Binnig|first1=G.|last2=Quate|first2=C. F.|title=Atomic Force Microscope|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=56|issue=9|year=1986|pages=930–933|issn=0031-9007|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.56.930|pmid=10033323|bibcode = 1986PhRvL..56..930B |doi-access=free}}</ref>

In 1987 Binnig was appointed [[IBM Fellow]]. In the same year, he started the IBM Physics group Munich, working on creativity.<ref>G. Binnig, "Aus dem Nichts. Über die Kreativität von Natur und Mensch", Piper (1990).</ref> and atomic force microscopy.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Giessibl | first1=F.

In 1994 Professor Gerd Binnig founded [[Cognition Network Technology#Definiens|Definiens]] which turned in the year 2000 into a commercial enterprise. The company developed [[Cognition Network Technology]] to analyze images just like the human eye and brain are capable of doing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.definiens.com/company/team|title=Team {{!}} Definiens|last=Health|first=Audacity|website=www.definiens.com|access-date=2016-06-06}}</ref>

in 2016, Binnig won the [[Kavli Prize|Kavli Prize in Nanoscience]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.kavliprize.org/prizes-and-laureates/prizes/2016-kavli-prize-nanoscience|title=2016 Kavli Prize in Nanoscience {{!}} www.kavliprize.org|website=www.kavliprize.org|access-date=2016-06-06|date=2016-06-02}}</ref> He became a fellow of the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.dnva.no/c40134/artikkel/vis.html?tid=40149|title=Group 2: Astronomy, Physics and Geophysics|publisher=[[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]]|access-date=22 December 2017|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6vtdJKwDo?url=http://english.dnva.no/c40134/artikkel/vis.html?tid=40149|archive-date=22 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The [[Binnig and Rohrer Nanotechnology Center]], an IBM-owned research facility in [[Rüschlikon]], Zürich is named after Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer.

==Personal life==
In 1969, Binnig married Lore Wagler, a psychologist, and they have a daughter born in [[Switzerland]] and a son born in [[California]].<ref name="nobelbio" /> His hobbies include reading, swimming, and golf.
