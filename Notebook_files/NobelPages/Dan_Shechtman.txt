==Biography==
Dan Shechtman was born in 1941 in [[Tel Aviv]], in what was then [[Mandatory Palestine]]; the city became part of the new state of Israel in 1948. He grew up in [[Petah Tikva]] and [[Ramat Gan]]. His grandparents had immigrated to Palestine during the  Second [[Aliyah]] (1904–1914) and founded a printing house. As a child Shechtman was fascinated by Jules Verne's [[The Mysterious Island]] (1874), which he read many times. His childhood dream was to become an engineer like the main protagonist, Cyrus Smith.

''I thought that was the best thing a person could do. The engineer in the book knows mechanics and physics, and he creates a whole way of life on the island out of nothing. I wanted to be like that.''<ref name="Haaretz">{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/clear-as-crystal-1.353504|title=Clear as crystal|publisher=Haaretz|date=April 1, 2011|access-date=October 6, 2011}}</ref>

Shechtman is married to Prof. Tzipora Shechtman, Head of the Department of Counseling and Human Development at [[Haifa University]], and author of two books on psychotherapy.<ref>[http://edu.haifa.ac.il/en/couns-ed/ Professor Zipora Shechtman] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401192225/http://edu.haifa.ac.il/en/couns-ed/ |date=April 1, 2012 }}.

==Academic career==
[[File:Dan Shechtman in 1985.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Meeting at NIST in 1985 where Shechtman (left) explains the atomic structure of quasicrystals]]
After receiving his Ph.D. in [[Materials Engineering]] from the [[Technion]] in 1972, where he also obtained his B.Sc. in [[Mechanical Engineering]] in 1966 and M.Sc. in Materials Engineering in 1968,<ref name=oldcv /> Prof. Shechtman was an [[United States National Research Council|NRC]] fellow at the [[Air Force Research Laboratory|Aerospace Research Laboratories]] at [[Wright Patterson Air Force Base|Wright Patterson AFB]], Ohio, where he studied for three years the microstructure and physical [[metallurgy]] of [[titanium]] aluminides. In 1975, he joined the department of materials engineering at Technion. In 1981–1983 he was on sabbatical at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where he studied rapidly solidified [[aluminum]] transition metal alloys, in a joint program with [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NBS]]. During this study he discovered the [[icosahedral phase]] which opened the new field of [[Quasicrystal|quasiperiodic crystals]].

In 1992–1994 he was on sabbatical at [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST), where he studied the effect of the defect structure of [[Chemical vapor deposition of diamond|CVD diamond]] on its growth and properties. Shechtman's Technion research is conducted in the Louis Edelstein Center, and in the Wolfson Centre which is headed by him. He served on several Technion Senate Committees and headed one of them.

Shechtman joined the Iowa State faculty in 2004. He currently spends about five months a year in [[Ames, Iowa|Ames]] on a part-time appointment.<ref name="newswise1"/><ref>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/breaking/chi-iowa-state-prof-wins-nobel-in-chemistry-20111005,0,6056569.story Iowa State prof wins Nobel in chemistry] ([[Chicago Tribune]], October 5, 2011)</ref>

Since 2014 he has been the head of the International Scientific Council of [[Tomsk Polytechnic University]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://news.tpu.ru/news/2014/04/04/21422-inter-union.html |title=В ТПУ впервые прошло заседание Международного научного совета |access-date=September 1, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903100623/http://news.tpu.ru/news/2014/04/04/21422-inter-union.html |archive-date=September 3, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Work on quasicrystals==
[[File:Quasicrystal1.jpg|thumb|Shechtman's Nobel Prize–winning work was in the area of [[quasicrystal]]s, ordered crystalline materials lacking repeating structures, such as this Al-Pd-Mn alloy.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Ünal|first=B |author2=V.

[[File:Nobel Dan Shechtman 2011-12-08.ogv|thumb|Interview with Dan Shechtman after his Nobel lecture]]
From the day Shechtman published his findings on quasicrystals in 1984 to the day [[Linus Pauling]] died (1994), Shechtman experienced hostility from him toward the non-periodic interpretation. "For a long time it was me against the world," he said. "I was a subject of ridicule and lectures about the basics of crystallography. The leader of the opposition to my findings was the two-time Nobel Laureate Linus Pauling, the idol of the American Chemical Society and one of the most famous scientists in the world. For years, 'til his last day, he fought against quasi-periodicity in crystals. He was wrong, and after a while, I enjoyed every moment of this scientific battle, knowing that he was wrong."<ref>{{cite press release |title=Iowa State, Ames Laboratory, Technion scientist wins Nobel Prize in Chemistry |url=https://www.news.iastate.edu/news/2011/oct/dannynobel |publisher=Iowa State University |location=Ames, Iowa |date=October 5, 2011}}</ref>

[[Linus Pauling]] is noted saying "There is no such thing as quasicrystals, only quasi-scientists."<ref name=reuters20111005>

Maki which had pointed out the possibility of a non-periodic [[Icosahedral Phase]] in [[quasicrystal]]s<ref>{{cite journal | title = Lattice Textures in Cholesteric Liquid Crystals | author = Kleinert H., Maki K. | journal = Fortschritte der Physik | volume = 29 | issue = 5 | pages = 219–259 | year = 1981 | doi = 10.1002/prop.19810290503 | url = http://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/~kleinert/75/75.pdf|bibcode = 1981ForPh..29..219K }}</ref> (see the

The Nobel Committee at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said that "his discovery was extremely controversial," but that his work "eventually forced scientists to reconsider their conception of the very nature of matter."<ref name="reuters20111005"/>
Through Shechtman's discovery, several other groups were able to form similar quasicrystals,{{when|date=October 2011}} finding these materials to have low thermal and [[electrical conductivity]], while possessing high structural stability.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} Quasicrystals have also been found naturally.

A [[quasiperiodic]] crystal, or, in short, [[quasicrystal]], is a [[structure]] that is [[Order and disorder (physics)|ordered]] but not [[Bravais lattice|periodic]]. A quasicrystalline pattern can continuously fill all available space, but it lacks [[translational symmetry]].<ref name=janot1997>
{{cite book |last=Janot|first=Christian |title=Quasicrystals – a primer, 2nd ed. |year=1997 |publisher=Oxford University Publishing }}</ref> "Aperiodic mosaics, such as those found in the medieval Islamic mosaics of the [[Alhambra palace]] in [[Spain]] and the [[Darb-e Imam|Darb-i Imam shrine]] in [[Iran]], have helped scientists understand what quasicrystals look like at the atomic level. In those mosaics, as in quasicrystals, the patterns are regular – they follow mathematical rules – but they never repeat themselves."<ref name=reuters20111005/>"An intriguing feature of such patterns, [which are] also found in Arab mosaics, is that the mathematical constant known as the Greek letter {{sic|tau|expected=phi}}, or the "[[golden ratio]]", occurs over and over again. Underlying it is a sequence worked out by [[Fibonacci]] in the 13th century, where each number is the sum of the preceding two."<ref name=reuters20111005/>

The Nobel prize was 10 million [[Swedish krona]] (approximately {{USD|1.5 million}}).<ref name="reuters20111005" />

==Presidential bid==
On January 17, 2014, in an interview with Israel's [[Channel 1 (Israel)|Channel One]], Shechtman announced his candidacy for [[President of Israel]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.jpost.com/National-News/Nobel-Prize-winning-professor-announces-run-for-President-of-Israel-338551 | title=Nobel Prize winning professor announces run for president of Israel}}</ref> Shechtman received the endorsement of the ten Members of Knesset required to run. In the [[2014 Israeli presidential election|elections]], held on June 10, 2014, he was awarded only one vote. This led Israeli press and Israeli humorists to qualify Shechtman as "quasi-president" in reference to the "quasi-scientist" quote.
