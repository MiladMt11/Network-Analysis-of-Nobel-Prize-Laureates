{{nihongo|'''Toshihide Maskawa''' (or '''Masukawa''')|益川 敏英|MASUKAWA Toshihide|7 February 1940 – 23 July 2021}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[theoretical physicist]] known for his work on [[CP-violation]] who was awarded one quarter of the 2008 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] "for the discovery of the origin of the [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|broken symmetry]] which predicts the existence of at least three families of [[quark]]s in nature."<ref name="nobelcitation">

==Early life and education==
Maskawa was born in [[Nagoya]], Japan. After [[World War II]] ended, the Maskawa family operated as a sugar wholesaler. A native of [[Aichi Prefecture]], Toshihide Maskawa graduated from [[Nagoya University]] in 1962 and received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in particle physics from the same university in 1967. His doctoral advisor was the physicist [[Shoichi Sakata]].<ref name="Nobel Biographical">

From early life Maskawa liked [[trivia]], also studied [[mathematics]], [[chemistry]], [[linguistics]] and various books. In high school, he loved [[novel]]s, especially detective and mystery stories and novels by [[Ryūnosuke Akutagawa]].<ref name="Nobel Biographical"/>

==Career==
At [[Kyoto University]] in the early 1970s, he collaborated with [[Makoto Kobayashi (physicist)|Makoto Kobayashi]] on explaining broken symmetry (the [[CP violation]]) within the [[Standard Model]] of particle physics.  Maskawa and Kobayashi's theory required that there be at least [[generation (physics)|three generations]] of quarks, a prediction that was confirmed experimentally four years later by the discovery of the [[bottom quark]].

Kobayashi and Maskawa were jointly awarded half of the 2008 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for this work, with the other half going to [[Yoichiro Nambu]].<ref name="nobelcitation" />

Maskawa was director of the [[Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics]] from 1997 to 2003.<ref>

==Nobel Lecture==
On 8 December 2008, after Maskawa told the audience "Sorry, I cannot speak English", he delivered his Nobel lecture on “What Did CP Violation Tell Us?” in Japanese language, at [[Stockholm University]]. The audience followed the subtitles on the screen behind him.<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2008/maskawa-lecture.html Toshihide Maskawa - Nobel Lecture: What Does CP Violation Tell Us?]</ref>
