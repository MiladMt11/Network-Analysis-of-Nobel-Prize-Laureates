'''David Morris Lee''' (born January 20, 1931) is an American physicist who shared the 1996 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] with [[Robert Coleman Richardson|Robert C. Richardson]] and [[Douglas D. Osheroff|Douglas Osheroff]] "for their discovery of [[superfluidity]] in [[helium-3]]."<ref>{{cite web | title = The Nobel Prize in Physics 1996 | publisher = Nobel Foundation | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1996/index.html| access-date = 2009-10-04}}</ref> Lee is professor emeritus of physics at [[Cornell University]] and distinguished professor of physics at [[Texas A&M University]].<ref>https://physics.cornell.edu/david-lee</ref> <ref>https://physics.tamu.edu/directory/david-lee/</ref>

==Personal life==
Lee was born and raised in [[Rye (town), New York|Rye]], [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref name="NobelBio">{{Nobelprize}} including the Nobel Lecture, December 7, 1996 ''The Extraordinary Phases of Liquid <sup>3</sup>He''</ref> His parents, Annette (Franks), a teacher, and Marvin Lee, an electrical engineer, were children of [[Jewish]] immigrants from [[England]] and [[Lithuania]]. He graduated from [[Harvard University]] in 1952 and then joined the [[U.S. Army]] for 22 months. After being discharged from the army, he obtained a master's degree from the [[University of Connecticut]].  In 1955 Lee entered the Ph.D. program at [[Yale University]] where he worked under [[Henry A. Fairbank]] in the low-temperature physics group, doing experimental research on liquid <sup>3</sup>He.

After graduating from Yale in 1959, Lee took a job at [[Cornell University]], where he was responsible for setting up the new [[Laboratory of Atomic and Solid State Physics]].  Shortly after arriving at Cornell he met his future wife, Dana, then a PhD student in another department; the couple went on to have two sons.

Lee moved his laboratory from Cornell to [[Texas A&M University]] on November 16, 2009.<ref name="TAMUMove1">http://media.www.thebatt.com/media/storage/paper657/news/2009/10/01/News/Nobel.Prize.Winner.Joins.Am.Faculty-3788924.shtml{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref name="TAMUMove2">{{Cite web | url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/hotstories/6643911.html |title = A&M lures Nobel Prize winner: Researcher of cold|date = 2009-09-29}}</ref><ref name="TAMUMove3">{{Cite web |url=http://www.science.tamu.edu/articles/684/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-10-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307181030/http://www.science.tamu.edu/articles/684 |archive-date=2010-03-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In the summer of 2016, Lee lost his wife, Dana, due to un-diagnosed health issues.

==Work==
The work that led to Lee's Nobel Prize was performed in the early 1970s.  Lee, together with [[Robert Coleman Richardson|Robert C. Richardson]] and graduate student, [[Douglas D. Osheroff|Doug Osheroff]] used a [[Pomeranchuk cooler|Pomeranchuk cell]] to investigate the behaviour of [[Helium-3|<sup>3</sup>He]] at temperatures within a few thousandths of a degree of absolute zero.  They discovered unexpected effects in their measurements, which they eventually explained as phase transitions to a superfluid phase of <sup>3</sup>He.<ref>{{cite journal

Lee's research also covered a number of other topics in low-temperature physics, particularly relating to liquid, solid and superfluid helium (<sup>4</sup>He, <sup>3</sup>He and mixtures of the two).  Particular discoveries include the antiferromagnetic ordering in solid helium-3, [[nuclear spin]] waves in spin polarized atomic hydrogen gas with [[Jack H. Freed]], and the tri-critical point on the phase separation curve of liquid <sup>4</sup>He-<sup>3</sup>He, in collaboration with his Cornell colleague [[John Reppy]]. His  former research group at Cornell currently studies impurity-helium solids.

As well as the Nobel Prize, other prizes won by Lee include the 1976 Sir [[Francis Simon]] Memorial Prize of the British [[Institute of Physics]] and the 1981 [[Oliver Buckley Prize]] of the [[American Physical Society]] along with Doug Osheroff and Robert Richardson for their superfluid <sup>3</sup>He work. In 1997, Lee received the Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Golden Plate Awardees of the American Academy of Achievement |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://achievement.org/our-history/golden-plate-awards/#science-exploration}}</ref>

Lee is a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

Lee is currently teaching physics at [[Texas A&M University]] and continuing his (formerly Cornell-based) research program there as well.

Lee is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President [[George W. Bush]] in May of 2008, urging him to "reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill" by requesting additional emergency funding for the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]’s [[Office of Science]], the [[National Science Foundation]], and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=A Letter from America's Physics Nobel Laureates|url=https://fire.pppl.gov/nobel_bush_fy08_050808.pdf}}</ref>
