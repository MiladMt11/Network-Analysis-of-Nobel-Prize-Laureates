== Life and career ==
[[File:Tasuku Honjo EM1B5529 (46157227432).jpg|thumb|left|200px|At Nobel press conference in Stockholm, December 2018]]
Honjo was born in Kyoto in 1942. He completed his [[Medical degree|M.D.]] degree in 1966 from the Faculty of Medicine, [[Kyoto University]], where in 1975 he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in Medical Chemistry under the supervision of [[Yasutomi Nishizuka]] and [[Osamu Hayaishi]].<ref name="JBIO">"{{cite web|url=http://www.brh.co.jp/s_library/j_site/scientistweb/no37/|title=免疫のしくみに魅せられて－何ごとにも主体的に挑む|language=ja}}</ref>

Honjo was a visiting fellow at the Department of Embryology, [[Carnegie Institution for Science|Carnegie Institution of Washington]], from 1971 to 1973.  He then moved to the U.S. [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) in Bethesda, Maryland, where he studied the genetic basis for the immune response at the [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] as a fellow between 1973 and 1977, followed by many years as an NIH Fogarty Scholar in Residence starting in 1992.  During part of this time, Honjo also was an assistant professor at the [[Tokyo Medical University|Faculty of Medicine, University of Tokyo]], between 1974 and 1979; a professor in the Department of Genetics, [[Osaka University|Osaka University School of Medicine]], between 1979 and 1984; and professor in the Department of Medical Chemistry, Kyoto University Faculty of Medicine, from 1984 to 2005.  Since 2005 Honjo has been a professor in Department of Immunology and Genomic Medicine, Kyoto University Faculty of Medicine.<ref name="JBIO"/> He was the President of [[University of Shizuoka|Shizuoka Prefecture Public University Corporation]] from 2012 to 2017.

He is a member of the Japanese Society for Immunology and served as its president between 1999 and 2000.  Honjo is also an honorary member of [[American Association of Immunologists]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aai.org/About/Allison-Honjo-Awarded-2018-Nobel-Prize|title=AAI Members Awarded the 2018 Nobel Prizein Physiology or Medicine|publisher=The American Association of Immunologists|access-date=October 4, 2018}}</ref>  In 2017 he became Deputy Director-General and Distinguished Professor of Kyoto University Institute for Advanced Study (KUIAS).<ref name="KP" />

===COVID-19 pandemic===
During the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], a false claim that Honjo believed that the novel coronavirus had been "manufactured" by a laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan was widely disseminated on the internet in many languages.<ref name="BBC News 2 May 2020">{{cite web | title= Coronavirus: Trump is selling coronavirus coins and other claims fact-checked: Fake Nobel Prize winner quote |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/52487960| author1= Jack Goodman| author2= Flora Carmichael| date= 2 May 2020| website= [[BBC News Online]] | access-date= 7 May 2020}}</ref> The BBC Reality Check team reported that, "In a statement published on the website of Kyoto University, he said he was 'greatly saddened' that his name had been used to spread 'false accusations and misinformation'.<ref name="BBC News 2 May 2020"/>

In 1992, Honjo first identified [[Programmed cell death protein 1|PD-1]] as an inducible gene on activated T-lymphocytes, and this discovery significantly contributed to the establishment of [[cancer immunotherapy]] principle by PD-1 blockade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ms-fund.keio.ac.jp/prize/winner/prize2016.html |title=The Keio Medical Science Prize Laureates 2016 |publisher=Ms-fund.keio.ac.jp |access-date=2018-10-01}}</ref>
