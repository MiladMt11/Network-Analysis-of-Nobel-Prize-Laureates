Beadle and Tatum's key experiments involved exposing the bread [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] ''[[Neurospora crassa]]'' to [[x-ray]]s, causing [[mutation]]s.  In a series of experiments, they showed that these mutations caused changes in specific [[enzyme]]s involved in [[metabolic pathway]]s.  These experiments led them to propose a direct link between genes and enzymatic reactions, known as the [[One gene-one enzyme hypothesis]].<ref name="onegeneonenz">{{Cite journal | last1 = Beadle | first1 = G.

==Education and early life==
George Wells Beadle was born in [[Wahoo, Nebraska]]. He was the son of Chauncey Elmer Beadle and Hattie Albro, who owned and operated a {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} farm nearby.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Beadle | first1 = G. W. | title = Recollections | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.43.070174.000245 | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 43 | pages = 1–13 | year = 1974 | pmid =  4605017| doi-access = free }}</ref> George was educated at the Wahoo High School and might himself have become a farmer if one of his teachers at school had not directed his mind towards science and persuaded him to go to the College of Agriculture in Lincoln, Nebraska. In 1926 he took his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree at the [[University of Nebraska]] and subsequently worked for a year with Professor [[Franklin David Keim|F.D. Keim]], who was studying hybrid wheat. In 1927 he took his [[Master of Science]] degree, and Professor Keim secured for him a post as Teaching Assistant at [[Cornell University]], where he worked, until 1931, with Professors [[Rollins A. Emerson|R.A. Emerson]] and [[Lester W. Sharp|L.W. Sharp]] on Mendelian asynapsis in ''[[Zea mays]]''.<ref name="phd"/> For this work he obtained, in 1931, his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree.<ref name="phd">{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=George Wells|last=Beadle |title=Genetical and Cytological Studies of Mendelian Asynapsis in Zea mays  |publisher=Cornell University |date=1930 |url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/301772751/|author-link=George Wells Beadle}}</ref>

==Career and research==
In 1931 Beadle was awarded a National Research Council Fellowship at the [[California Institute of Technology]] at Pasadena, where he remained from 1931 until 1936. During this period he continued his work on Indian corn and began, in collaboration with Professors [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]], S. Emerson, and [[Alfred Sturtevant]], work on crossing-over in the fruit fly, ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In 1935 Beadle visited [[Paris]] for six months to work with Professor [[Boris Ephrussi]] at the Institut de Biologie physico-chimique. Together they began the study of the development of eye pigment in Drosophila which later led to the work on the biochemistry of the genetics of the fungus Neurospora for which Beadle and Edward Lawrie Tatum were together awarded the 1958 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.

In 1936 Beadle left the California Institute of Technology to become Assistant Professor of Genetics at [[Harvard University]]. A year later he was appointed Professor of Biology (Genetics) at [[Stanford University]] and there he remained for nine years, working for most of this period in collaboration with Tatum.  This work of Beadle and Tatum led to an important generalization. This was that most mutants unable to grow on minimal medium, but able to grow on “complete” medium, each require addition of only one particular supplement for growth on minimal medium. If the synthesis of a particular nutrient (such as an [[amino acid]] or [[vitamin]]) was disrupted by [[mutation]], that mutant strain could be grown by adding the necessary nutrient to the minimal medium.<ref>Beadle, G. W. (1966) "Biochemical genetics: some recollections", pp. 23-32 in Phage and the Origins of Molecular Biology, edited by J. Cairns, G. S. Stent and J. D. Watson. Cold Spring Harbor Symposia, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory of Quantitative Biology, NY. ASIN: B005F08IQ8</ref>  This finding suggested that most mutations affected only a single [[metabolic pathway]]. Further evidence obtained soon after the initial findings tended to show that generally only a single step in the pathway is blocked. Following their first report of three such [[auxotrophy|auxotroph]] mutants in 1941, Beadle and Tatum used this method to create series of related mutants and determined the order in which amino acids and some other [[metabolite]]s were synthesized in several metabolic pathways.  The obvious inference from these experiments was that each gene mutation affects the activity of a single enzyme. This led directly to the [[one gene-one enzyme hypothesis]], which, with certain qualifications and refinements, has remained essentially valid to the present day. As recalled by Horowitz,<ref>Horowitz NH (May, 1996).  "The sixtieth anniversary of biochemical genetics".  Genetics. 143 (1): 1-4. doi:10.1093/genetics/143.1.1.PMC 1207243. PMID 8722756</ref>  the work of Beadle and Tatum also demonstrated that [[gene]]s have an essential role in [[biosynthesis]]. At the time of the experiments (1941), non-geneticists still generally believed that genes governed only trivial biological traits, such as eye color, and bristle arrangement in fruit flies, while basic biochemistry was determined in the cytoplasm by unknown processes. Also, many respected geneticists thought that gene action was far too complicated to be resolved by any simple experiment. Thus Beadle and Tatum brought about a fundamental revolution in our understanding of genetics.

In 1946 Beadle returned to the California Institute of Technology as Professor of Biology and Chairman of the Division of Biology. Here he remained until January 1961 when he was elected Chancellor of the University of Chicago and, in the autumn of the same year, President of this University.

After retiring, Beadle undertook a remarkable experiment in [[maize]] genetics.  In several laboratories he grew a series of [[Teosinte]]/Maize crosses.  Then he crossed these progeny with each other.  He looked for the rate of appearance of parent phenotypes among this second generation.  The vast majority of these plants were intermediate between maize and Teosinte in their features, but about 1 in 500 of the plants were identical to either the parent maize or the parent teosinte.  Using the mathematics of Mendelian genetics, he calculated that this showed a difference between maize and teosinte of about 5 or 6 genetic loci.  This demonstration was so compelling that most scientists now agree that Teosinte is the wild progenitor of maize.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Beadle | first1 = G.

During his career, Beadle has received many honors. These include the Honorary [[Doctor of Science]] of the following Universities: Yale (1947), Nebraska (1949), Northwestern University (1952), Rutgers University (1954), Kenyon College (1955), Wesleyan University (1956), the [[University of Birmingham]] and the [[University of Oxford]], England (1959), Pomona College (1961), and Lake Forest College (1962). In 1962 he was also given the honorary degree of LL.D. by the University of California, Los Angeles. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1946.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=May 28, 2011}}</ref> He also received the Lasker Award of the American Public Health Association (1950), the Dyer Award (1951), the Emil Christian Hansen Prize of Denmark (1953), the Albert Einstein Commemorative Award in Science (1958), the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1958 with Edward Tatum and [[Joshua Lederberg]], the National Award of the American Cancer Society (1959), and the Kimber Genetics Award of the National Academy of Sciences (1960).

The [[George W. Beadle Award]] of the [[Genetics Society of America]] is named in his honor. George Beadle Middle School in [[Millard, Nebraska]] (Part of the [[Millard Public Schools]] district) was named after him. It opened in 2001. The Beadle Center, which houses the Department of Biochemistry at the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln|University of Nebraska-Lincoln]], is also named after George Beadle.

==Personal life==
Beadle was married twice. By his first wife he had a son, David, who now lives at The Hague, the Netherlands.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} His second wife, Muriel McClure (1915-1994), a well-known writer, was born in California. Beadle's chief hobbies were rockclimbing, skiing, and gardening. He was a member of [[FarmHouse]] [[fraternity]] while at the University of Nebraska.{{fact|date=April 2019}}

Beadle died on June 9, 1989. He was an atheist.<ref>George Beadle, An Uncommon Farmer: The Emergence of Genetics in the 20th Century. CSHL Press. 2003. p. 273. {{ISBN|9780879696887}}. Beadle's views on this occasion were somewhat more tempered than David's characterization of him as a "vehement atheist," and from his earliest days "intolerant of religion and other forms of superstition."</ref>
