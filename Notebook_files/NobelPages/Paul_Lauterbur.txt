'''Paul Christian Lauterbur''' (May 6, 1929 – March 27, 2007) was an [[United States|American]] [[chemist]] who shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 2003 with [[Peter Mansfield]] for his work which made the development of [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) possible.<ref name=Filler2009b>Filler, AG: The history, development, and impact of computed imaging in neurological diagnosis and neurosurgery: CT, MRI, DTI: [http://precedings.nature.com/documents/3267/version/4 Nature Precedings ] {{doi|10.1038/npre.2009.3267.4}}.</ref>

Lauterbur was a professor at [[Stony Brook University]] from 1963 until 1985, where he conducted his research for the development of the [[MRI]].<ref>{{Cite journal |author=P. C.

He never stopped working with undergraduates on research, and he served as a professor of chemistry, with appointments in bioengineering, biophysics, the College of Medicine at Urbana-Champaign and computational biology at the Center for Advanced Study.<ref name="pittsburghgazette">{{cite news | title = Nobel Prize for MRI began with a burger in New Kensington| author = Spice, Byron | date = October 7, 2003 | url = http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/03280/228666.stm | newspaper = Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | access-date = August 5, 2007 }}</ref>

==Early life==
Lauterbur was of [[Luxembourgers|Luxembourgish]] ancestry. Born and raised in [[Sidney, Ohio]], Lauterbur graduated from [[Sidney High School (Ohio)|Sidney High School]], where a new Chemistry, Physics, and Biology wing was dedicated in his honor. As a [[teenager]], he built his own [[laboratory]] in the basement of his parents' house.<ref name="economist">{{cite news | title =  Paul Lauterbur |  date = April 7, 2007 | url = http://www.economist.com/obituary/displaystory.cfm?story_id=8954439 | newspaper = The Economist | access-date = August 4, 2007 }}</ref>  His [[chemistry]] teacher at school understood that he enjoyed experimenting on his own, so the teacher allowed him to do his own experiments at the back of class.<ref name="economist"/>

When he was drafted into the [[United States Army]] in the 1953s,{{why|date=April 2020}} and was assigned to the Army Chemical Center in Edgewood, Maryland. His superiors allowed him to spend his time working on an early [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR) machine; he had published four scientific papers by the time he left the Army.<ref name="economist"/> Paul became an [[atheist]] later on.<ref>Dawson, M. Joan. Paul Lauterbur and the Invention of MRI. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT, 2013. Print. "Paul became an atheist, revering intellectual honesty and the quest for truth."</ref>

==Education and career==
Lauterbur received a BS in chemistry from the Case Institute of Technology, now part of [[Case Western Reserve University]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] where he became a Brother of the Alpha Delta chapter of [[Phi Kappa Tau]] fraternity. He then went to work at the Mellon Institute laboratories of the [[Dow Corning]] Corporation, with a 2-year break to serve at the Army Chemical Center in [[Edgewood, Maryland]]. While working at Mellon Institute he pursued graduate studies in chemistry at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. Earning his PhD in 1962, the following year Lauterbur accepted a position as associate professor at [[Stony Brook University]]. As a visiting faculty in chemistry at [[Stanford University]] during the 1969–1970 academic year, he undertook NMR-related research with the help of local businesses [[Syntex]] and [[Varian Associates]]. Lauterbur returned to Stony Brook, continuing there until 1985 when he moved to the [[University of Illinois]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2003/lauterbur-autobio.html?print=1|title=Autobiography|last=Lauterbur|first=Paul C.|year=2003|work=Nobel Prize official website|access-date=October 11, 2012}}</ref>

==The development of the MRI==
Lauterbur credits the idea of the MRI to a brainstorm one day at a suburban [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] [[Eat'n Park]] [[Big Boy Restaurants|Big Boy Restaurant]], with the MRI's first model scribbled on a table napkin while he was a student and researcher at both the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and the [[Mellon Institute of Industrial Research]].<ref name="economist"/><ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.pittmag.pitt.edu/fall2004/feature1.html | first=Cindy | last=Gill | title=Magnetic Personality | date=Fall 2004 | journal=Pitt Magazine | publisher=University of Pittsburgh | location=Pittsburgh, PA | access-date=June 19, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9VsEAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA17|title=Imperial Technoscience: Transnational Histories of MRI in the United States, Britain, and India|last=Prasad|first=Amit|date=March 14, 2014|publisher=MIT Press|page=17|isbn=9780262026956|language=en}}</ref>  <!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:PaulLauterbursGroup1976.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Paul Lauterbur's Lab circa 1976]]  -->The further research that led to the Nobel Prize was performed at [[Stony Brook University]]<ref>[http://commcgi.cc.stonybrook.edu/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=5&num=755 Nobel Prize Awardee Paul Lauterbur Returns To SBU Where His Winning Research Was Conducted In The '70s]</ref> in the 1970s.

The [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1952, which went to [[Felix Bloch]] and [[Edward Mills Purcell|Edward Purcell]], was for the development of [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] (NMR), the scientific principle behind MRI. However, for decades magnetic resonance was used mainly for studying the [[chemical structure]] of substances. It wasn't until the 1970s with Lauterbur's and Mansfield's developments that NMR could be used to produce images of the body.

Lauterbur used the idea of [[Robert Gabillard]] (developed in his doctoral thesis, 1952) of introducing gradients in the [[magnetic field]] which allows for determining the origin of the [[radio wave]]s emitted from the [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of the object of study. This spatial information allows two-dimensional pictures to be produced.<ref name="economist"/>

While Lauterbur conducted his work at Stony Brook, the best NMR machine on campus belonged to the chemistry department; he had to visit it at night to use it for experimentation and would carefully change the settings so that they would return to those of the chemists' as he left.<ref name="nytimesannounce">{{cite news | title =  American and Briton Win Nobel for Using Chemists' Test for M.R.I.'s | author = Wade, Nicholas | date = October 7, 2003 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9800EFDC103CF934A35753C1A9659C8B63 | newspaper = New York Times | access-date = August 4, 2007 }}</ref>   The original MRI machine is located at the Chemistry building on the campus of Stony Brook University in [[Stony Brook, New York]].

Some of the first images taken by Lauterbur included those of a 4-mm-diameter clam<ref>{{cite journal|author=Becker, Edwin D.|title=Obituary: Paul Christian Lauterbur|journal=Physics Today|date=July 2007|volume=60|issue=7|pages=77–78|doi=10.1063/1.2761815|bibcode = 2007PhT....60g..77B }}</ref> his daughter had collected on the beach at the [[Long Island Sound]], green peppers<ref name="economist"/> and two test tubes of heavy water within a beaker of ordinary water; no other imaging technique in existence at that time could distinguish between two different kinds of water.  This last achievement is particularly important as the human body consists mostly of water.<ref name="nytimesannounce"/>

When Lauterbur first submitted his paper with his discoveries to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', the paper was rejected by the editors of the journal. Lauterbur persisted and requested them to review it again, upon which time it was published and is now acknowledged as a classic ''Nature'' paper.<ref name="natureclassic">{{cite journal | title =  MRI — a new way of seeing |   url = http://www.nature.com/physics/looking-back/lauterbur/index.html | journal = Nature | access-date = August 4, 2007 }}</ref> The ''Nature'' editors pointed out that the pictures accompanying the paper were too fuzzy, although they were the first images to show the difference between heavy water and ordinary water.<ref name="economist"/> Lauterbur said of the initial rejection: "You could write the entire history of science in the last 50 years in terms of papers rejected by ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' or ''Nature''."<ref name="nytimesannounce"/>

Peter Mansfield of the [[University of Nottingham]] in the [[United Kingdom]] took Lauterbur's initial work another step further, replacing the slow (and prone to artefacts) projection-reconstruction method used by Lautebur's original technique with a method that used frequency and phase encoding by spatial gradients of magnetic field. Owing to [[Larmor precession]], a mathematical technique called a [[Fourier transformation]] could then be used to recover the desired image, greatly speeding up the imaging process.<ref name="nytimesannounce"/>

Lauterbur unsuccessfully attempted to file patents related to his work to commercialize the discovery.<ref name="ntyimespatent">{{cite news | title =  Patent Fights Aplenty for M.R.I. Pioneer|author=Deutsch, Claudia |  date = April 7, 2007 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906E0DF1F39F931A25754C0A961958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=print | newspaper = New York Times | access-date = August 4, 2007 }}</ref> The [[State University of New York]] chose not to pursue patents, with the rationale that the expense would not pay off in the end. "The company that was in charge of such applications decided that it would not repay the expense of getting a patent. That turned out not to be a spectacularly good decision," Lauterbur said in 2003. He attempted to get the federal government to pay for an early prototype of the MRI machine for years in the 1970s, and the process took a decade.<ref name="latimes">{{cite news | title =  Paul Lauterbur, 77; 'the father of MRI'|author=Maugh, Thomas |  date = April 7, 2007 | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-me-lauterbur28mar28,1,7609292.story?track=rss&ctrack=1&cset=true | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | access-date = August 4, 2007 }}</ref>  The University of Nottingham did file patents which later made Mansfield wealthy.<ref name="latimes"/>

==Nobel Prize==
Lauterbur was awarded the Nobel Prize along with Mansfield in the fall of 2003.  Controversy occurred when [[Raymond Damadian]] took out full-page ads in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' headlined "The Shameful Wrong That Must Be Righted" saying that the Nobel committee had not included him as a Prize winner alongside Lauterbur and Mansfield for his early work on the MRI. Damadian claimed that he discovered MRI and the two Nobel-winning scientists refined his technology.

''The New York Times'' published an editorial saying that while scientists credit Damadian for holding an early patent in MRI technology, Lauterbur and Mansfield expanded upon [[Herman Carr]]'s technique in order to produce first 2D and then 3D MR images. The editorial deems this to be worthy of a Nobel prize even though it states clearly in Alfred Nobel's will that prizes are not to be given out solely on the basis of improving an existing technology for commercial use.  The newspaper then points out a few cases in which precursor discoveries had been awarded with a Nobel, along with a few deserving cases in which it had not, such as [[Rosalind Franklin]], [[Oswald Avery]], {{interlanguage link|Robert Gabillard|fr}}.<ref name="nytimesnobel">{{cite news | title = No Nobel Prize for Whining | author = Judson, Horace | date = October 20, 2003 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/20/opinion/no-nobel-prize-for-whining.html | newspaper = New York Times | access-date = May 4, 2018 }}</ref><ref name="iht">{{cite news | title = Paul Lauterbur, MRI pioneer and Nobel Laureate, dies| author = Chang, Kenneth | date = March 28, 2007 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/28/world/americas/28iht-obits.4.5060418.html | publisher = International Herald Tribune (now New York Times International Edition) | access-date = May 4, 2018 }}</ref>

==Death==
Lauterbur died aged 77 in March 2007 of [[kidney disease]] at his home in [[Urbana, Illinois]].  University of Illinois Chancellor [[Richard Herman]] said, "Paul's influence is felt around the world every day, every time an MRI saves the life of a daughter or a son, a mother or a father."<ref name="iht"/>
