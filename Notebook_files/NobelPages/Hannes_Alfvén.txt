'''Hannes Olof Gösta Alfvén''' ({{IPA-sv|alˈveːn|lang}}; 30 May 1908 – 2 April 1995<ref>{{cite work|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/05/obituaries/hannes-alfven-86-founder-of-field-in-physics-is-dead.html|author=Walter Sullivan|title=Hannes Alfven, 86, Founder Of Field in Physics, Is Dead|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 5, 1995}}</ref>) was a Swedish [[electrical engineer]], [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] physicist and winner of the 1970 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his work on [[magnetohydrodynamics]] (MHD).  He described the class of MHD waves now known as [[Alfvén wave]]s. He was originally trained as an electrical power engineer and later moved to research and teaching in the fields of plasma physics and electrical engineering.  Alfvén made many contributions to plasma physics, including theories describing the behavior of [[aurora (astronomy)|aurora]]e, the [[Van Allen radiation belt]]s, the effect of [[Geomagnetic storm|magnetic storms]] on the [[Earth's magnetic field]], the terrestrial [[magnetosphere]], and the dynamics of plasmas in the [[Milky Way]] galaxy.

== Education ==

Alfvén received his PhD from the [[University of Uppsala]] in 1934.<ref name="Who Was Who">{{cite book|title=Who Was Who in America, 1993-1996, vol. 11|date=1996|publisher=Marquis Who's Who|location=New Providence, N.J.|isbn=978-0-8379-0225-8|page=4|chapter=Alfvén, Hannes Olof Gosta|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/whowaswhoinameri11marq}}</ref> His thesis was titled "Investigations of High-frequency Electromagnetic Waves."{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

== Early years ==

In 1934, Alfvén taught [[physics]] at both the [[University of Uppsala]] and the Nobel Institute for Physics (later renamed the [[Manne Siegbahn]] Institute of Physics<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.msl.se/MSL_files/history.htm |access-date=25 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427231243/http://www.msl.se/MSL_files/history.htm |archive-date=27 April 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>) in [[Stockholm]], Sweden.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} In 1940, he became professor of electromagnetic theory and electrical measurements at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in Stockholm.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} In 1945, he acquired the nonappointive position of Chair of Electronics. His title was changed to Chair of Plasma Physics in 1963.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} From 1954 to 1955, Alfvén was a Fulbright Scholar at the [[University of Maryland, College Park]]. In 1967, after leaving Sweden and spending time in the [[Soviet Union]], he moved to the United States.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} Alfvén worked in the departments of [[electrical engineering]] at both the [[University of California, San Diego]] and the [[University of Southern California]].{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

== Later years ==
In 1991, Alfvén retired as professor of electrical engineering at the [[University of California, San Diego]] and professor of [[plasma physics]] at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in Stockholm.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

Alfvén spent his later adult life alternating between [[California]] and Sweden.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} He died at the age of 86.

== Research ==
In 1937, Alfvén argued that if [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] pervaded the universe, it could then carry electric currents capable of generating a galactic magnetic field.<ref>Hannes Alfvén, 1937 "Cosmic Radiation as an Intra-galactic Phenomenon", ''Ark. f. mat., astr. o. fys.'' 25B, no. 29.</ref> After winning the Nobel Prize for his works in [[magnetohydrodynamics]], he emphasized that:

<blockquote>In order to understand the phenomena in a certain plasma region, it is necessary to map not only the magnetic but also the electric field and the electric currents. Space is filled with a network of currents which transfer energy and momentum over large or very large distances. The currents often pinch to filamentary or surface currents. The latter are likely to give space, as also interstellar and intergalactic space, a cellular structure.<ref>{{cite journal  | last = Hannes | first = A | url = http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1990ITPS...18....5A&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML&amp;format=&amp;high=42ca922c9c32555 | title = Cosmology in the Plasma Universe: An Introductory Exposition | date =1990 | journal = IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science | issn =  0093-3813 | volume = 18  | issue = 1 | pages = 5–10|bibcode = 1990ITPS...18....5P |doi = 10.1109/27.45495 }}</ref></blockquote>

His theoretical work on field-aligned electric currents in the aurora (based on earlier work by [[Kristian Birkeland]]) was confirmed in 1967,<ref>{{cite conference |title=3-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations of spiral galaxies |authors=Peratt, A. L., Peter, W., & Snell, C. M. |conference=Galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields |book-title=Proceedings of the 140th Symposium of IAU |location=Heidelberg, Federal Republic of Germany |date=June 19–23, 1989 |publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers |pages=143–150 |bibcode=1990IAUS..140..143P }}</ref> these currents now being known as [[Birkeland current]]s.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

Alfvén's work was disputed for many years by the senior scientist in space physics, the British [[mathematician]] and [[Geophysics|geophysicist]] [[Sydney Chapman (astronomer)|Sydney Chapman]].<ref>S. Chapman and J. Bartels, ''Geomagnetism," Vol. 1 and 2, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1940.</ref> Alfvén's disagreements with Chapman stemmed in large part from trouble with the [[peer review]] system. Alfvén rarely benefited from the acceptance generally afforded senior scientists in [[scientific journal]]s. He once submitted a paper on the theory of [[magnetic storm]]s and [[Auroral light|aurora]]s to the American journal ''[[Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity]]'' only to have his paper rejected on the ground that it did not agree with the theoretical calculations of conventional physics of the time.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hannes Alfvén (1908-1995) |url=http://public.lanl.gov/alp/plasma/people/alfven.html |access-date=22 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222214748/http://public.lanl.gov/alp/plasma/people/alfven.html |archive-date=22 December 2008 }}</ref> He was regarded as a person with [[Fringe science|unorthodox opinion]]s in the field by many physicists,<ref>{{cite book | last = Miller | first = DJ | author2 = Hersen M | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0471520683&id=sw9QeD–bvJgC&pg=PA10 10] | title = Research Fraud in the Behavioral and Biomedical Sciences | date = 1992 | isbn = 978-0471520689 | url = https://archive.org/details/researchfraudinb0000unse/page/ }}</ref> [[Roger H. Stuewer|R. H.

Alfvén recalled:

<blockquote>When I describe [plasma phenomena] according to this formalism most referees do not understand what I say and turn down my papers. With the referee system which rules US science today, this means that my papers are rarely accepted by the leading US journals.<ref>Hannes Alfvén, "Memoirs of a Dissident Scientist", ''American Scientist'', Volume 76, No 3, May–June 1988, pp. 249–251. Quoted in Joseph Paul Martino, ''[https://archive.org/details/sciencefundingpo0000mart/page/131 Science Funding: Politics and Porkbarrel]'' 1992, Transaction Publishers, {{ISBN|1-56000-033-3}}</ref></blockquote>

Alfvén played a central role in the development of:

* [[Plasma physics]]
* [[Charged particle beam]]s
* [[Interplanetary medium]]
* [[Magnetospheric physics]]
* [[Magnetohydrodynamics]]
* [[:Category:Solar phenomena|Solar phenomena]] investigation (such as the [[solar wind]])
* [[Aurora (astronomy)|Aurorae science]]

In 1939, Alfvén proposed the theory of [[geomagnetic storm|magnetic storm]]s and auroras and the theory of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma dynamics]] in the [[earth]]'s [[magnetosphere]].{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} This was the paper rejected by the U.S. journal ''Terrestrial Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity''.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

Applications of Alfvén's research in space science include:

* [[Van Allen radiation belt]] theory
* Reduction of the [[Earth's magnetic field]] during [[magnetic storm]]s
* [[Magnetosphere]] (protective plasma covering the Earth)
* Formation of [[comet]] tails
* Formation of the [[Solar System]]
* [[Astrophysical plasma|Dynamics of plasmas in the galaxy]]
* [[Physical cosmology]]

Alfvén's views followed those of the founder of magnetospheric physics, [[Kristian Birkeland]].{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} At the end of the nineteenth century, Birkeland proposed (backed by extensive data) that electric currents flowing down along the Earth's magnetic fields into the atmosphere caused the aurora and polar magnetic disturbances.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

Areas of technology benefiting from Alfvén's contributions include:

* [[Particle accelerator]]s
* Controlled [[thermonuclear fusion]]
* [[Hypersonic flight]]
* [[Rocket]] propulsion
* [[Atmospheric reentry|Reentry]] braking of [[space vehicle]]s

Contributions to astrophysics:

* Galactic magnetic field (1937)
* Identified nonthermal [[synchrotron radiation]] from astronomical sources (1950)

[[Alfvén wave]]s (low [[frequency]] hydromagnetic plasma [[oscillator|oscillations]]) are named in his honor, and propagate at the Alfvén speed.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} Many of his theories about the solar system were verified as late as the 1980s through external measurements of cometary and planetary magnetospheres.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}} But Alfvén himself noted that astrophysical textbooks poorly represented known plasma phenomena:

<blockquote>A study of how a number of the most used textbooks in astrophysics treat important concepts such as [[Double layer (plasma)|double layers]], [[critical ionization velocity|critical velocity]], [[pinch effect]]s, and circuits is made. It is found that students using these textbooks remain essentially ignorant of even the existence of these concepts, despite the fact that some of them have been well known for half a century (e.g, double layers, Langmuir, 1929; pinch effect, Bennet, 1934).<ref>Hannes Alfvén, "[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1986ITPS...14..779A&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML&amp;format=&amp;high=42ca922c9c02197 Double layers and circuits in astrophysics]" (1986) ''IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science'' (ISSN 0093-3813), vol. PS-14, Dec. 1986, p. 779-793.</ref></blockquote>

Alfvén reported that of 17 of the most used textbooks on astrophysics, none mention the pinch effect, none mentioned critical ionization velocity, only two mentioned circuits, and three mentioned double layers.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

Alfvén believed the problem with the [[Big Bang]] was that astrophysicists tried to extrapolate the origin of the universe from [[mathematical theory|mathematical theories]] developed on the blackboard, rather than starting from known observable phenomena. He also considered the Big Bang to be a [[mythology|myth]] devised to explain creation.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Hannes |last=Alfvén |title=Cosmology—Myth or Science? |journal= Journal of Astrophysics and Astronomy|volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=79–98 |year=1984 |doi=10.1007/BF02714974 |bibcode=1984JApA....5...79A |s2cid=122751100 }}</ref> Alfvén and colleagues proposed the [[Alfvén–Klein cosmology|Alfvén–Klein model]] as an alternative [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] theory to both the [[Big Bang]] and [[steady state theory]] cosmologies.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

== Personal life ==
Alfvén was married for 67 years to his wife Kerstin (1910–1992). They raised five children, one boy and four girls. Their son became a physician, while one daughter became a writer and another a lawyer in Sweden. The writer was [[Inger Alfvén]] and is well known for her work in Sweden. The composer [[Hugo Alfvén]] was Hannes Alfvén's uncle.

Alfvén studied the [[history of science]], [[oriental philosophy]], and [[religion]]. On his religious views, Alfven was [[irreligious]] and critical of religion.<ref>"Nuclear power is uniquely unforgiving: as Swedish Nobel physicist Hannes Alfvén said, "No acts of God can be permitted."" Amory Lovins, [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/insidenova/author/amory-lovins/ Inside NOVA - Nuclear After Japan: Amory Lovins], ''pbs.org''.</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Matter and Spirit in the Universe: Scientific and Religious Preludes to Modern Cosmology|date=2004|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=9781860944697|page=252|author=Helge Kragh|author-link=Helge Kragh|quote=Alfven dismissed in his address religion as a "myth," and passionately criticized the big-bang theory for being dogmatic and violating basic standards of science, to be no less mythical than religion.}}</ref> He spoke Swedish, English, German, French, and Russian, and some Spanish and Chinese. He expressed great concern about the difficulties of permanent [[high-level radioactive waste management]]."<ref name="radioactive1979">{{cite journal|author=Abbotts, John|date=October 1979|title=Radioactive waste: A technical solution?|journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists|volume=35|issue=8| pages=12–18|doi=10.1080/00963402.1979.11458649|bibcode=1979BuAtS..35h..12A}}</ref> Alfvén was also interested in problems in cosmology and all aspects of auroral physics, and used Schröder's well known book on aurora, ''Das Phänomen des Polarlichts''.<ref>Schröder, Wilfried . 2000.
