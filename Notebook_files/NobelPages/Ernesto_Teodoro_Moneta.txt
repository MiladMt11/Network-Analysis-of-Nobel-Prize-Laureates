'''Ernesto Teodoro Moneta''' (September 20, 1833 in [[Milan]], [[Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia]] &ndash; February 10, 1918) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] journalist, nationalist, revolutionary soldier and later a pacifist and Nobel Peace Prize Laureate. He adopted the motto ''In varietate unitas!'' which later inspired [[Motto of the European Union]].

At age 15, Moneta participated in the "[[Five Days of Milan]]" (1848 uprising against Austrian rule). He later attended the military academy in [[Ivrea]]. In 1859 he joined [[Garibaldi]]'s [[Expedition of the Thousand]], and also fought in the ranks of the Italian army [[Third Italian War of Independence|against the Austrians in 1866]]. 

Subsequently, he became an international [[peace movement|peace activist]], despite his strong Italian [[nationalism]]. 

Between 1867 and 1896 he was editor of the Milan democratic paper ''[[Il Secolo]]'', published by [[Edoardo Sonzogno]]. 

In 1887 he founded the Lombard  Association for Peace and Arbitration (Unione Lombarda per la Pace e l'Arbitrato), which called for disarmament and envisaged the creation of a [[League of Nations]] and [[Permanent Court of Arbitration]]. He won (with [[Louis Renault (jurist)|Louis Renault]]) the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1907.

In the last years of his life, however, Moneta's [[Italian nationalism]] reasserted itself and got the better of his pacifism. He expressed public support for both the [[Italian Conquest of Libya]] in 1912 and [[Italy in World War I|Italy's entry into the First World War]] in 1915.
