'''David Jonathan Gross''' ({{IPAc-en|g|r|oʊ|s}}; born February 19, 1941) is an American [[particle physics|theoretical physicist]] and [[string theory|string theorist]]. Along with [[Frank Wilczek]] and [[David Politzer]], he was awarded the 2004 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]]<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2004|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2004/gross/facts/|access-date=2021-01-20|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US}}</ref> for their discovery of [[asymptotic freedom]]. Gross is the Chancellor's Chair Professor of Theoretical Physics at the [[Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics]] (KITP) of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] (UCSB),<ref>{{Cite web|title=UC Santa Barbara, David Gross|url=https://www.kitp.ucsb.edu/gross|url-status=live|access-date=2021-04-30}}</ref> and was formerly the KITP director and holder of their [[Frederick Gluck|Frederick W.

==Early life and education==
Gross was born to a Jewish family in Washington, D.C., in February 1941. His parents were Nora (Faine) and [[Bertram Myron Gross]] (1912–1997). Gross received his bachelor's degree from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], Israel, in 1962.  He received his Ph.D. in physics from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1966, under the supervision of [[Geoffrey Chew]].
 
==Career==
He was a Junior Fellow at [[Harvard University]] (1966-69)<ref>{{Cite web|title=Harvard University. Department of Physics|url=https://history.aip.org/phn/21507004.html|access-date=2021-04-30|website=history.aip.org}}</ref> and a Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics at [[Princeton University]] until 1997, when he began serving as Princeton's Thomas Jones Professor of Mathematical Physics Emeritus.<ref>{{Cite web|title=David Gross {{!}} Department of Physics|url=https://phy.princeton.edu/people/david-gross|access-date=2021-01-12|website=phy.princeton.edu}}</ref>  He has received many honors, including a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship in 1987 and the Dirac Medal in 1988.

In 1973, Professor Gross, working with his first graduate student, Frank Wilczek, at Princeton University, discovered [[asymptotic freedom]]—the primary feature of non-Abelian gauge theories—led Gross and Wilczek to the formulation of [[quantum chromodynamics]] (QCD), the theory of the strong nuclear force. Asymptotic freedom is a phenomenon where the nuclear force weakens at short distances, which explains why experiments at very high energy can be understood as if nuclear particles are made of non-interacting quarks. The flip side of asymptotic freedom is that the force between quarks grows stronger as one tries to separate them. Therefore, the closer [[quarks]] are to each other, the less the [[strong interaction]] (or [[color charge]]) is between them; when quarks are in extreme proximity, the nuclear force between them is so weak that they behave almost as free particles. This is the reason why the nucleus of an atom can never be broken into its quark constituents.

QCD completed the [[Standard Model]], which details the three basic forces of particle physics—the electromagnetic force, the weak force, and the strong force. Gross was awarded the 2004 Nobel Prize in Physics, with Politzer and Wilczek, for this discovery.<ref name=":0" />

Gross, with [[Jeffrey A. Harvey]], [[Emil Martinec]], and [[Ryan Rohm]] also formulated the theory of the [[heterotic string]]. The four were whimsically nicknamed the "Princeton String Quartet."<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/07/science/07stri.html?_r=1&pagewanted=1&fta=y String Theory, at 20, Explains It All (or Not)]. NY Times (2004-12-07)</ref> He continues to do research in this field at the KITP.<ref>{{Cite web|last=ORCID|title=David Gross (0000-0002-1485-7107)|url=https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1485-7107|access-date=2021-07-28|website=orcid.org|language=en}}</ref> 

==Activism==
In 2003, Gross was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the [[Humanism and Its Aspirations|Humanist Manifesto]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Humanism and Its Aspirations: Notable Signers|url=https://americanhumanist.org/what-is-humanism/manifesto3/signers/|access-date=2021-04-30|website=American Humanist Association|language=en-US}}</ref>

Gross is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President George W. Bush in May 2008, urging him to "reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill" by requesting additional emergency funding for the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]’s [[Office of Science]], the [[National Science Foundation]], and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=A Letter from America's Physics Nobel Laureates|url=https://fire.pppl.gov/nobel_bush_fy08_050808.pdf}}</ref>

In 2015, Gross signed the ''[[Mainau Declaration|Mainau Declaration 2015 on Climate Change]]'' on the final day of the 65th [[Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings|Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting]]. The declaration was signed by a total of 76 Nobel Laureates and handed to then-President of the French Republic, François Hollande, as part of the successful [[Paris Climate Change Conference|COP21 climate summit]] in Paris.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mainaudeclaration.org/|title=Mainau Declaration|website=www.mainaudeclaration.org|access-date=2018-01-11}}</ref>

== Family ==
Gross' first wife was Shulamith (Toaff), and they had two children. He also has a stepdaughter by his second wife, Jacquelyn Savani.<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2004/gross-bio.html nobelprize.org]</ref> He has three brothers, including [[Samuel R. Gross]], professor of law, and [[Teddy Gross|Theodore (Teddy) Gross]], a playwright.
