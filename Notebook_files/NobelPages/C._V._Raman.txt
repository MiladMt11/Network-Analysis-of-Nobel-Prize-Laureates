S. Krishnan]] discovered that when light traverses a transparent material, the deflected light changes its [[wavelength]] and [[frequency]]. This phenomenon, a hitherto unknown type of scattering of light, which they called "modified scattering" was subsequently termed the Raman effect or [[Raman scattering]]. Raman received the 1930 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for the discovery and was the first Asian to receive a Nobel Prize in any branch of science.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Singh|first1=Rajinder|last2=Riess|first2=Falk|date=1998|title=Sir C. V. Raman and the story of the Nobel prize|journal=Current Science|volume=75|issue=9|pages=965–971|jstor=24101681}}</ref>

Born to [[Tamil Brahmin]] parents, Raman was a [[Child prodigy|precocious child]], completing his secondary and higher secondary education from [[St Aloysius' Anglo-Indian High School]] at the ages of 11 and 13, respectively. He topped the [[bachelor's degree]] examination of the [[University of Madras]] with honours in physics from [[Presidency College, Chennai|Presidency College]] at age 16. His first research paper, on [[diffraction of light]], was published in 1906 while he was still a graduate student. The next year he obtained a [[master's degree]]. He joined the [[Indian Audit and Accounts Service|Indian Finance Service]] in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]] as Assistant Accountant General at age 19. There he became acquainted with the [[Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science]] (IACS), the first research institute in India, which allowed him to do independent research and where he made his major contributions in [[acoustics]] and [[optics]].

In 1917, he was appointed as the first [[Palit Professor of Physics]] by [[Ashutosh Mukherjee]] at the [[Rajabazar Science College]] under the [[University of Calcutta]]. On his first trip to [[Europe]], seeing the [[Mediterranean Sea]] motivated him to identify the prevailing explanation for the [[Color of water|blue colour of the sea]] at the time, namely the reflected [[Rayleigh scattering|Rayleigh-scattered light]] from the sky, as being incorrect. He founded the ''[[Indian Journal of Physics]]'' in 1926. He moved to [[Bangalore]] in 1933 to become the first Indian director of the [[Indian Institute of Science]]. He founded the [[Indian Academy of Sciences]] the same year. He established the [[Raman Research Institute]] in 1948 where he worked to his last days.

The Raman effect was discovered on 28 February 1928. The day is celebrated annually by the [[Government of India]] as the [[National Science Day]]. In 1954, the Government of India honoured him with the first [[Bharat Ratna]], its highest civilian award. He later smashed the medallion in protest against Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]'s policies on scientific research.

In 1909, Raman was transferred to [[Yangon|Rangoon]], [[British Burma]] (now [[Myanmar]]), to take up the position of currency officer. After only a few months, he had to return to Madras as his father succumbed to fatal illness. The subsequent death of his father and funeral rituals compelled him to remain there for the rest of the year.<ref name=":7">{{Cite book|last=Basu|first=Tejan Kumar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FKOaDAAAQBAJ|title=The Life and Times of C.V.

Raman was chosen by the [[University of Calcutta]] to become the [[Palit Professor of Physics]], a position established after the benefactor [[Taraknath Palit|Sir Taraknath Palit]], in 1913. The university senate made the appointment on 30 January 1914, as recorded in the meeting minutes:<blockquote>

The following appointments to the Palit Professorships were made at the meeting of the Senate on 30 January 1914: Dr P C Ray and Mr C.V. Raman, MA... The appointment of each Professor shall be permanent. A Professor shall vacate his office upon completion of sixtieth year of his age.<ref name=":38" /></blockquote>Prior to 1914, Ashutosh Mukherjee had invited [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] to take up the position, but Bose declined.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Blanpied|first=William A.|date=1986|title=Pioneer Scientists in Pre‐Independence India|journal=Physics Today|language=en|volume=39|issue=5|pages=36–44|doi=10.1063/1.881025|bibcode=1986PhT....39e..36B}}</ref> As a second choice, Raman became the first Palit Professor of Physics but was delayed for taking up the position as [[World War I]] broke out. It was only in 1917 when he joined [[Rajabazar Science College]], a campus created by the University of Calcutta in 1914, that he became a full-fledged professor.<ref name=":38" /> He reluctantly resigned as a civil servant after a decade of service, which was described as "supreme sacrifice"<ref name=":4" /> since his salary as a professor would be roughly half of his salary at the time. But to his advantage, the terms and conditions as a professor were explicitly indicated in the report of his joining the university, which stated:<blockquote>Mr C.V. Raman’s acceptance of the Sir T N Palit Professorship on condition that he will not be required to go out of India... Reported that Mr C. V. Raman joined his appointment as Palit Professor of Physics from 2.7.17... Mr Raman informed that he will not be required to take any teaching work in MA and MSc classes, to the detriment of his own research or assisting advanced students in their researches.<ref name=":5" /></blockquote>Raman's appointment as the Palit Professor was strongly objected to by some members of the Senate of the University of Calcutta, especially foreign members, as he had no [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] and had never studied abroad. As a kind of rebuttal, Mukherjee arranged for an honorary [[DSc]] which the University of Calcutta conferred Raman in 1921.

=== Musical sound ===

One of Raman's interests was on the scientific basis of musical sounds. He was inspired by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]'s ''The Sensations of Tone'', the book he came across when he joined IACS.<ref name=":37" /> He published his findings prolifically between 1916 and 1921. He worked out the theory of [[:wikt:transverse|transverse]] vibration of [[bowed string instrument]]s based on [[Superposition principle|superposition]] of velocities.

As soon as the ''S.S. Narkunda'' docked in Bombay Harbour (now [[Mumbai Harbour]]), Raman finished an article "The colour of the sea" that was published in the November 1921 issue of ''Nature''. He noted that Rayleigh's explanation is "questionable by a simple mode of observation" (using Nicol prism).<ref name="Nature1921" /> As he thought:<blockquote>

Looking down into the water with a Nicol in front of the eye to cut off surface reflections, the track of the sun’s rays could be seen entering the water and appearing by virtue of perspective to converge to a point at a considerable depth inside it. The question is: What is it that diffracts the light and makes its passage visible? An interesting possibility that should be considered in this connection is that the diffracting particles may, at least in part, be the molecules of the water themselves.<ref name=":38" /></blockquote>

=== Raman effect ===

{{main|Raman scattering}}

==== Background ====

Raman's second important discovery on the scattering of light was a new type of radiation, an eponymous phenomenon called the Raman effect.<ref name=":28" /> After discovering the nature of light scattering that caused blue colour of water, he focused on the principle behind the phenomenon. His experiments in 1923 showed the possibility of other light rays formed in addition to [[incident ray]] when sunlight was filtered through a violet glass in certain liquids and solids. Ramanathan believed that this was a case of a "trace of [[fluorescence]]."<ref name=":38" /> In 1925, [[K. S. Krishnan]], a new Research Associate, noted the theoretical background for the existence of an additional scattering line beside the usual polarised elastic scattering when light scatters through liquid.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Krishnan|first=K.S.|date=1925|title=LXXV. On the molecular scattering of light in liquids|journal=The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science|language=en|volume=50|issue=298|pages=697–715|doi=10.1080/14786442508634789}}</ref> He referred to the phenomenon as "feeble fluorescence."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mallik|first=D.

The major impetus was the discovery of [[Compton scattering|Compton effect]]. [[Arthur Compton]] at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] had found evidence in 1923 that [[electromagnetic waves]] can also be described as particles.<ref name="Compton effect">{{cite journal|author=Compton, Arthur H.|date=May 1923|title=A Quantum Theory of the Scattering of X-Rays by Light Elements|journal=[[Physical Review]]|volume=21|issue=5|pages=483–502|bibcode=1923PhRv...21..483C|doi=10.1103/PhysRev.21.483|doi-access=free}}</ref> By 1927, the phenomenon was widely accepted by scientists, including Raman.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Raman|first=C.

But look here Krishnan. If this is true of X-Rays, it must be true of Light too. I have always thought so. There must be an Optical analogue to Compton Effect. We must pursue it and we are on the right lines. It must and shall be found. The Nobel Prize must be won."<ref name=":14">{{Cite journal|last=Ramdas|first=L. A.|date=1973|title=Dr. C. V.

As Compton later recollected "that it was probably the Toronto debate that led him to discover the Raman effect two years later."<ref name=":37" /> The Toronto debate was about the discussion on the existence of light quantum at the [[British Science Association|British Association for the Advancement of Science]] meeting held at Toronto in 1924. There Compton presented his experimental findings, which [[William Duane (physicist)|William Duane]] of [[Harvard University]] argued with his own with evidence that light was a wave.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Rajinder|date=2002|title=C.

Krishnan started the experiment in the beginning of January 1928.<ref name=":11" /> On 7 January, he discovered that no matter what kind of pure liquid he used, it always produced polarised fluorescence within the [[visible spectrum]] of light. As Raman saw the result, he was astonished why he never observed such phenomenon all those years.<ref name=":11" /> That night he and Krishnan named the new phenomenon as "modified scattering" with reference to the Compton effect as an unmodified scattering. On 16 February, they sent a manuscript to ''Nature'' titled "A new type of secondary radiation", which was published on 31 March.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Raman|first1=C. V.|last2=Krishnan|first2=K.

On 28 February 1928, they obtained spectra of the modified scattering separate from the [[incident light]]. Due to difficulty in measuring the wavelengths of light, they had been relying on visual observation of the colour produced from sunlight through prism. Raman had invented a type of [[spectrograph]] for detecting and measuring electromagnetic waves.<ref name=":10" /><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.businessinsider.in/science/news/how-is-c-v-raman-connected-with-the-national-science-day/articleshow/74371450.cms#:~:text=On%20February%2028%2C%201928%2C%20Raman,a%20couple%20of%20years%20later.|title=How is C.V Raman connected with The National Science Day|work=Business Insider|date=28 February 2020|access-date=26 February 2021|archive-date=15 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200415053333/https://www.businessinsider.in/science/news/how-is-c-v-raman-connected-with-the-national-science-day/articleshow/74371450.cms#:~:text=On%20February%2028%2C%201928%2C%20Raman,a%20couple%20of%20years%20later.|url-status=live}}</ref> Referring to the invention, Raman later remarked, "When I got my Nobel Prize, I had spent hardly 200 [[rupees]] on my equipment,"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Long|first=D.

The same day, Raman made the announcement before the press. The ''[[Associated Press of India]]'' reported it the next day, on 29 February, as "New theory of radiation: Prof. Raman's Discovery."<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Jagdish|first1=Mehra|author-link1=Jagdish Mehra |title=The Historical Development of Quantum Volume 6 Part 1|last2=Rechenberg|first2=Helmut| author-link2=Helmut Rechenberg |publisher=Springer|year=2001|isbn=978-0-387-95262-8|location=New York|pages=360|oclc=76255200}}</ref> It ran the story as:<blockquote>Prof. C. V. Raman, F.R.S., of the Calcutta University, has made a discovery which promises to be of fundamental significance to physics... The new phenomenon exhibits features even more startling than those discovered by Prof. Compton with X-rays. The principal feature observed is that when matter is excited by light of one colour, the atoms contained in it emit light of two colours, one of which is different from the exciting colour and is lower down the spectrum. The astonishing thing is that the altered colour is quite independent of the nature of the substance used.<ref name=":28">{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Rajinder|date=2018-03-01|title=The 90th Anniversary of the Raman Effect|url=http://insa.nic.in/writereaddata/UpLoadedFiles/IJHS/Vol53_1_2018__Art04.pdf|journal=Indian Journal of History of Science|volume=53|issue=1|pages=50–58|doi=10.16943/ijhs/2018/v53i1/49363|doi-access=free|access-date=17 March 2020|archive-date=25 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200825164824/https://insa.nic.in/writereaddata/UpLoadedFiles/IJHS/Vol53_1_2018__Art04.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>The news was reproduced by ''[[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]]'' on 1 March under the headline "Scattering of Light by Atoms – New Phenomenon – Calcutta Professor's Discovery."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Long|first=D.

==== Reception and outcome ====

Some physicists, particularly French and German physicists were initially sceptical of the authenticity of the discovery. [[Georg Joos]] at the [[Friedrich Schiller University of Jena]] asked [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] at the [[University of Munich]], "Do you think that Raman's work on the optical Compton effect in liquids is reliable?... The sharpness of the scattered lines in liquids seems doubtful to me". Sommerfeld then tried to reproduce the experiment, but failed.<ref name=":13">{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Rajinder|date=2008|title=80 Years Ago - the Discovery of the Raman Effect at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Kolkata, India|url=http://arxiv.iacs.res.in:8080/jspui/bitstream/10821/8110/1/80%20years%20ago%20-%20the%20Discovery%20of%20the%20Raman_By%20Rajinder%20Singh.pdf|url-status=dead|journal=Indian Journal of Physics|volume=82|pages=987–1001|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200606142247/http://arxiv.iacs.res.in:8080/jspui/bitstream/10821/8110/1/80%20years%20ago%20-%20the%20Discovery%20of%20the%20Raman_By%20Rajinder%20Singh.pdf|archive-date=6 June 2020|access-date=8 March 2020}}</ref> On 20 June 1928, Peter Pringsheim at the [[University of Berlin]] was able to reproduce Raman's results successfully.

In addition to being a new phenomenon itself, the Raman effect was one of the earliest proofs of the [[Light#Quantum theory|quantum nature of light]]. [[Robert W.

Raman was confident that he would win the Nobel Prize in Physics as well but was disappointed when the Nobel Prize went to [[Owen Richardson]] in 1928 and to [[Louis de Broglie]] in 1929. He was so confident of winning the prize in 1930 that he booked tickets in July, even though the awards were to be announced in November.

==Personal life==

Raman married Lokasundari Ammal (1892–1980) on 6 May 1907.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=35659|title=Raman, Sir (Chandrashekhara) Venkata|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|access-date=6 October 2013|archive-date=8 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308062316/http://www.oxforddnb.com/templates/article.jsp?articleid=35659|url-status=live}}</ref> It was a self-arranged marriage and his wife was 13 years old. His wife later jokingly recounted that their marriage was not so much about her musical prowess (she was playing ''[[veena]]'' when they first met) as "the extra allowance which the Finance Department gave to its married officers."<ref name=":24" /> The extra allowance refers to an additional INR 150 for married officers at the time.<ref name=":33" /> Soon after they moved to Calcutta in 1907, the couple were accused of converting to Christianity. It was because they frequently visited [[St. John's Church, Kolkata]] as Lokasundari was fascinated with the church music and Raman with the acoustics.<ref name=":24" />

They had two sons, Chandrasekhar Raman and [[Venkatraman Radhakrishnan]], a [[radio astronomer]]. Raman was the paternal uncle of [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]], recipient of the 1983 Nobel Prize in Physics.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/chandrasekhar-google-honours-171018135910958.html |title=S Chandrasekhar: Why Google honours him |work=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=19 October 2017 |access-date=18 October 2017 |archive-date=1 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180901044401/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/10/chandrasekhar-google-honours-171018135910958.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Throughout his life, Raman developed an extensive personal collection of stones, [[mineral]]s, and materials with interesting light-scattering properties, which he obtained from his world travels and as gifts.<ref>{{Citation|last=Periodic Videos|title=Diamonds, Pearls and Atomic Bomb Stones – Periodic Table of Videos|date=28 January 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdcjSuvU7z0&t=7s|access-date=12 November 2018|archive-date=12 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210812101622/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdcjSuvU7z0&t=7s|url-status=live}}</ref> He often carried a small, handheld [[Optical spectrometer|spectroscope]] to study specimens.<ref>{{Citation|last=Periodic Videos|title=Special Spectroscope – Periodic Table of Videos|date=28 January 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UET11Pt6Qw|access-date=12 November 2018|archive-date=11 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190211120545/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UET11Pt6Qw&t=0s&list=PLEUMnCfLypBCR1zpeT-mn-NtehwzlTady&index=13|url-status=live}}</ref> These, along with his spectrograph, are on display at IISc.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Poovaiah|first=D.

Lord Rutherford was instrumental in some of Raman's most pivotal moments in life. He nominated Raman for the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930, presented him the Hughes Medal as President of the Royal Society in 1930, and recommended him for the position of Director at IISc in 1932.<ref name=":6" />

Raman had a sense of obsession with the Nobel Prize. In a speech at the University of Calcutta, he said, "I'm not flattered by the honour [Fellowship to the Royal Society in 1924] done to me. This is a small achievement. If there is anything that I aspire for, it is the Nobel Prize.

=== Religious views ===

Although Raman hardly talked about religion, he was openly an [[agnostic]],<ref name=":24" /> but objected to being labelled atheist.<ref name=":32">{{Cite book|last=Jayaraman|first=Aiyasami|title=Op cit.|date=1989|pages=5|oclc=21675106}}</ref> His agnosticism was largely influenced by the philosophies of [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Charles Bradlaugh]], and [[Robert G.

Though it was not customary to wear turbans in South Indian culture, he explained his habit as, "Oh, if I did not wear one, my head will swell. You all praise me so much and I need a turban to contain my ego."<ref name=":37" /> He even attributed his turban for the recognition he received on his first visit to England, particular from J. J. Thomson and Lord Rutherford.<ref name=":24" /> In a public speech, he once said,<blockquote>There is no Heaven, no [[Svarga|Swarga]], no Hell, no rebirth, no [[reincarnation]] and no immortality. The only thing that is true is that a man is born, he lives and he dies. Therefore, he should live his life properly.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Rajinder|date=2010|title=Letters to the Editor: Indian scientists vs. science and religion|url=http://www.scienceandculture-isna.org/july-aug10/Letter%20to%20editors.pdf|journal=Science and Culture|volume=76|issue=7–8|pages=206|access-date=18 March 2020|archive-date=12 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200712042500/http://www.scienceandculture-isna.org/july-aug10/Letter%20to%20editors.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>In a friendly meeting with [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and Gilbert Rahm, a German zoologist, the conversation turned to religion. Raman spoke,<blockquote>I shall answer your [Rahm's] question. If there is a God we must look for him in the Universe. If he is not there, he is not worth looking for... The growing discoveries in the science of astronomy and physics seem to be further and further revelations of God.<ref name=":32" /></blockquote>

== Death ==

At the end of October 1970, Raman had a [[cardiac arrest]] and collapsed in his laboratory. He was moved to the hospital where doctors diagnosed his condition and declared that he would not survive another four hours.<ref name=":19">{{Cite web|url=http://bengaluru.citizenmatters.in/the-last-years-raman-s-meeting-with-nehru-and-more-7877|title=The last years: Raman's meeting with Nehru and more|last=Kulkarni|first=Pavan|date=20 November 2015|website=Citizen Matters|language=en-GB|access-date=15 March 2020|archive-date=19 February 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200219211923/http://bengaluru.citizenmatters.in/the-last-years-raman-s-meeting-with-nehru-and-more-7877|url-status=live}}</ref> He however survived a few days and requested to stay in the gardens of his institute surrounded by his followers.<ref name=":8">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/cvramanpictorial00bang|title=C.V.

Two days before Raman died, he told one of his former students, "Do not allow the journals of the Academy to die, for they are the sensitive indicators of the quality of science being done in the country and whether science is taking root in it or not."<ref name=":24" /> That evening, Raman met with the Board of Management of his institute in his bedroom and discussed with them the fate of the institute's management.<ref name=":8" /> He also willed his wife to perform a simple [[cremation]] without any rituals upon his death. He died from natural causes early the next morning on 21 November 1970 at the age of 82.<ref name=":19" />

On the news of Raman's death, Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]] publicly announced, saying,<blockquote>The country, the House [of Parliament], and everyone of us will mourn the death of Dr. C. V. Raman. He was the greatest scientist of modern India and one of the greatest intellects our country has produced in its long history. His mind was like the diamond, which he studied and explained.

== Controversies ==

===The Nobel Prize===

==== Independent discovery ====

In 1928, [[Grigory Landsberg]] and [[Leonid Mandelstam]] at the [[Moscow State University]] independently discovered the Raman effect. They published their findings in July issue of ''[[Naturwissenschaften]],''<ref name=":31">{{Cite journal|last1=Landsberg|first1=G.|last2=Mandelstam|first2=L.|date=1928|title=Eine neue Erscheinung bei der Lichtzerstreuung in Krystallen|journal=Die Naturwissenschaften|language=de|volume=16|issue=28|pages=557–558|doi=10.1007/BF01506807|bibcode=1928NW.....16..557.|s2cid=22492141}}</ref> and presented their findings at the Sixth Congress of the Russian Association of Physicists held at [[Saratov]] between 5 and 16 August.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Usanov|first1=D.

According to the Nobel Committee, however: (1) the Russians did not come to an independent interpretation of their discovery as they cited Raman's article; (2) they observed the effect only in crystals, whereas Raman and Krishnan observed it in solids, liquids and gases, and therefore proved the universal nature of the effect; (3) the problems concerning the intensity of Raman and infrared lines in the spectra had been explained during the previous year; (4) the Raman method had been applied with great success in different fields of molecular physics; and (5) the Raman effect had effectively helped to check the symmetry properties of molecules, and thus the problems concerning nuclear spin in atomic physics.<ref name=":15" />

=== The Raman–Born controversy ===

During October 1933 to March 1934, [[Max Born]] was employed by IISc as Reader in Theoretical Physics following the invitation by Raman early in 1933.<ref name=":20">{{Cite web|url=https://connect.iisc.ac.in/2019/12/when-raman-brought-born-to-bangalore/|title=When Raman Brought Born to Bangalore – Connect with IISc|last=Ramaswamy|first=Karthik|date=12 December 2019|website=Connect|language=en-GB|access-date=15 March 2020|archive-date=7 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201107174106/https://connect.iisc.ac.in/2019/12/when-raman-brought-born-to-bangalore/|url-status=live}}</ref> Born at the time was a refugee from [[Nazi Germany]] and temporarily employed at [[St John's College, Cambridge]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Born|first=Max|date=1965|title=Recollections of Max Born II.

=== Indian authorities ===

Raman had an aversion to the then [[Prime Minister of India]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and Nehru's policies on science. In one instance he smashed the bust of Nehru on the floor. In another he shattered his [[Bharat Ratna]] medallion to pieces with a hammer, as it was given to him by the Nehru government.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Parameswaran|first=Uma|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/772714846|title=Op. cit.|year=2011|pages=222|oclc=772714846|access-date=11 September 2020|archive-date=12 August 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210812101648/https://www.worldcat.org/title/cv-raman-a-biography/oclc/772714846|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":39">{{Cite web|last=Malhotra|first=Inder|date=2014|title=C.

On the same occasion Nehru, offered Raman financial assistance to his institute which Raman flatly refused by replying, "I certainly don't want this to become another government laboratory."<ref name=":19" /> Raman was particularly against the control of research programmes by the government such as in the establishment of the [[Bhabha Atomic Research Centre]] (BARC), [[Defense Research and Development Organization]] (DRDO), and the [[Council of Scientific and Industrial Research]] (CSIR).<ref name=":21" /><ref name=":23">{{Cite web|url=https://www.deccanchronicle.com/lifestyle/viral-and-trending/280217/no-raman-effect-how-his-dream-died-a-quiet-death.html|title=No Raman effect: How his dream died a quiet death|last=Srikanth|first=B.

The Government of Madras advised him to apply for funds from the central government. But Raman clearly foresaw, as he replied to [[C.

Raman described AICC authorities as "a big ''tamasha''" (drama or spectacle) that just kept on discussing issues without action. As to problems of food resources in India, his advice to the government was, "We must stop breeding like pigs and the matter will solve itself."<ref name=":18" />

==== Indian Academy of Sciences ====

The Indian Academy of Sciences was born out of conflicts during the procedures of proposal for a national scientific organisation in line with the Royal Society.<ref name=":27">{{Cite journal|last=Balaram|first=P.|date=2009|title=Anniversaries at the Academies|url=https://www.currentscience.ac.in/php/show_article.php?volume=096&issue=01&titleid=id_096_01_0005_0006_0&page=0005|journal=Current Science|volume=96|issue=1|pages=5–6}}</ref> In 1933, the Indian Science Congress Association (ISCA), at the time the largest scientific organisation, planned to establish a national science body, which would be authorised to advice the government on scientific matters.<ref name=":25">{{Cite book|last=Parameswaran|first=Uma|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lrx3wLz4itkC|title=Op. cit.|year=1999|isbn=978-81-317-2818-5|pages=145–147}}</ref> [[Sir Richard Gregory, 1st Baronet|Sir Richard Gregory]], then editor of ''Nature,'' on his visit to India had suggested Raman, as editor of ''Current Science'', to establish an Indian Academy of Sciences. Raman was of the opinion that it should be an exclusively Indian membership as opposed to the general consensus that British members should be included. He resolved that "How can India Science prosper under the tutelage of an academy which has its own council of 30, 15 of who are Britishers of whom only two or three are fit enough to be its Fellows." On 1 April 1933, he convened a separate meeting of the south Indian scientists. He and Subba Rao officially resigned from ISCA.<ref name=":26">{{Cite book|last=Govil|first=Girjesh|title=Science and Modern India: An Institutional History, c. 1784-1947|date=2010|publisher=Pearson|isbn=978-93-325-0294-9|editor-last=Dasgupta|editor-first=Uma|location=Delhi|pages=143–156|oclc=895913622}}</ref>

Raman registered the new organisation as Indian Academy of Sciences on 24 April to the Registrar of Societies.<ref name=":25" /> It was a provisional name to be changed to the Royal Society of India after approval from the [[Royal Charter]]. The Government of India did not recognise it as an official national scientific body, as such the ICSA created a separate organisation named the National Institute of Sciences of India on 7 January 1935 (but again changed to the [[Indian National Science Academy]] in 1970).<ref name=":26" /> INSA had been led by the foremost rivals of Raman including [[Meghnad Saha]], Bhabha, Bhatnagar, and Krishnan.<ref name=":27" />

==== Indian Institute of Science ====

Raman had a great fallout with the authorities at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc). He was accused of biased development in physics, while ignoring other fields.<ref name=":20" /> He lacked diplomatic personality on other colleagues, which [[S. Ramaseshan]], his nephew and later Director of IISc, reminisced, saying, "Raman went in there like a bull in a china shop."<ref name=":22">{{Cite journal|last=Ramaseshan|first=S.|date=1988|title=The portrais of a scientist – C. V. Raman|journal=Current Science|volume=57|issue=22|pages=1207–1220|jstor=24091067}}</ref> He wanted research in physics at the level of those of western institutes, but at the expense of other fields of science.<ref name=":20" /> [[Max Born]] observed, "Raman found a sleepy place where very little work was being done by a number of extremely well paid people."<ref name=":22" /> At the Council meeting, Kenneth Aston, professor in the Electrical Technology Department, harshly criticised Raman and Raman's recruitment of Born. Raman had every intention of giving full position of professor to Born.<ref name=":37"/> Aston even made personal attack on Born by referring to him as someone "who was rejected by his own country, a renegade and therefore a second-rate scientist unfit to be part of the faculty, much less to be the head of the department of physics."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jayaraman|first=K.

The Council of IISc constituted a review committee to oversee Raman's conduct in January 1936. The committee, chaired by [[James Irvine (chemist)|James Irvine]], Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the [[University of St Andrews]], reported in March that Raman had misused the funds and entirely shifted the "centre of gravity" towards research in physics, and also that the proposal of Born as Professor of Mathematical Physics (which was already approved by the Council in November 1935) was not financially feasible.<ref name=":20" /> The Council offered Raman two choices, either to resign from the institute with effect from 1 April or resign as the Director and continue as Professor of physics; if he did not make the choice, he was to be fired. Raman was inclined to take up the second choice.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Venkataraman|first=G.|date=24 October 2013|title=Some reflections on the life and science of Sir C. V.

=== The Royal Society ===

Raman never seemed to have thought highly of the Fellowship of the Royal Society.<ref name=":18" /> He tendered his resignation as a Fellow on 9 March 1968, which the Council of the Royal Society accepted on 4 April. However, the exact reason was not documented.<ref name=":35">{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Rajinder|date=2002|title=The story of C. V.

Particularly after the [[Independence of India]], the Royal Society had its own disputes on this matter.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Collins|first=Peter|title=The Royal Society and the Promotion of Science since 1960|year=2016|isbn=978-1-107-02926-2|location=Cambridge, United Kingdom|pages=235|oclc=912704183}}</ref>

According to Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar, ''[[The London Times]]'' had once made a list of the Fellows, in which Raman was omitted. Raman wrote to and demanded explanation from [[Patrick Blackett]], the then President of the society. He was dejected by Blackett's response that the society had no role in the newspaper.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Wali|first=Kameshwar C.|title=Op. cit.|date=1991|location=253|oclc=21297960}}</ref> According to Krishnan, another cause was a disapproving review Raman received on a manuscript he had submitted to the ''[[Proceedings of the Royal Society]]''. It could have been these cumulative factors as Raman wrote in his resignation letter, and said, "I have taken this decision after careful consideration of all the circumstances of the case. I would request that my resignation be accepted and my name removed from the list of the Fellows of the Society."<ref name=":35" />

*[[C. V. Raman Global University]] was established in 1997.
* In 1998, the [[American Chemical Society]] and [[Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science]] recognised Raman's discovery as an [[National Historic Chemical Landmarks|International Historic Chemical Landmark]] at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science in Jadavpur, Calcutta, India. The inscription on the commemoration plaque reads:<blockquote>At this institute, Sir C. V. Raman discovered in 1928 that when a beam of coloured light entered a liquid, a fraction of the light scattered by that liquid was of a different color. Raman showed that the nature of this scattered light was dependent on the type of sample present. Other scientists quickly understood the significance of this phenomenon as an analytical and research tool and called it the Raman Effect. This method became even more valuable with the advent of modern computers and lasers. Its current uses range from the non-destructive identification of minerals to the early detection of life-threatening diseases. For his discovery Raman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1930.<ref name=":10" /></blockquote>
