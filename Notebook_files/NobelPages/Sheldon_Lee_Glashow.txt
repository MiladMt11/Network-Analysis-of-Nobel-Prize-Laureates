'''Sheldon Lee Glashow''' ({{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|ɡ|l|æ|ʃ|oʊ}},<ref>{{Cite American Heritage Dictionary|Glashow|access-date=30 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/glashow|title=Glashow|work=[[Collins English Dictionary]]|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|access-date=30 July 2019}}</ref> {{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|ɡ|l|æ|ʃ|aʊ}};<ref>{{Cite Oxford Dictionaries|Glashow, Sheldon Lee|access-date=30 July 2019}}</ref> born December 5, 1932) is a [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel Prize]]-winning [[United States|American]] [[Theoretical physics|theoretical]] [[physicist]]. He is the [[Metcalf Center for Science and Engineering|Metcalf]] [[Professor]] of [[Mathematics]] and [[Physics]] at [[Boston University]] and Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics, Emeritus, at [[Harvard University]], and is a member of the Board of Sponsors for the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]''.

==Birth and education==
Sheldon Lee Glashow was born in [[New York City]], to [[Ashkenazi Jews|Jewish]] immigrants from [[Russian Empire|Russia]], Bella (née Rubin) and Lewis Gluchovsky, a plumber.<ref name="brittanica">[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9036986/Sheldon-Lee-Glashow Sheldon Lee Glashow – Britannica Encyclopedia]. Britannica.com. Retrieved on 2012-07-27.</ref> He graduated from [[Bronx High School of Science]] in 1950. Glashow was in the same graduating class as [[Steven Weinberg]], whose own research, independent of Glashow's, would result in Glashow,  Weinberg, and [[Abdus Salam]] sharing the 1979 Nobel Prize in Physics (see below).<ref name="nobel-bio">[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1979/glashow-autobio.html Glashow's autobiography]. Nobelprize.org. Retrieved on 2012-07-27.</ref>  Glashow received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Cornell University]] in 1954 and a Ph.D. degree in physics from [[Harvard University]] in 1959 under Nobel-laureate physicist [[Julian Schwinger]]. Afterwards, Glashow became a NSF fellow at [[NORDITA]] and joined the [[University of California, Berkeley]] where he was an associate professor from 1962 to 1966.<ref>[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/glashow.html Sheldon Glashow]. Jewishvirtuallibrary.org. Retrieved on 2012-07-27.</ref> He joined the Harvard physics department as a professor in 1966, and was named Eugene Higgins Professor of Physics in 1979; he became emeritus in 2000.  Glashow has been a visiting scientist at [[CERN]], and professor at [[Aix-Marseille University]], [[MIT]], [[Brookhaven Laboratory]], [[Texas A&M]], the [[University of Houston]], and [[Boston University]].<ref name="nobel-bio" />

==Research==
In 1961,<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Glashow|first=Sheldon L.|date=February 1961|title=Partial-symmetries of weak interactions|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0029558261904692|journal=Nuclear Physics|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=579–588|doi=10.1016/0029-5582(61)90469-2|bibcode=1961NucPh..22..579G}}</ref> Glashow extended [[electroweak unification]] models due to [[Julian Schwinger|Schwinger]] by including a short range [[neutral current]], the [[W and Z bosons#Z boson|Z<sup>0</sup>]]. The resulting symmetry structure that Glashow proposed, [[SU(2)]] × [[U(1)]], forms the basis of the accepted theory of the [[electroweak]] interactions. For this discovery, Glashow along with [[Steven Weinberg]] and [[Abdus Salam]], was awarded the 1979 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].

In collaboration with [[James Bjorken]], Glashow was the first to predict a fourth quark, the [[charm quark]], in 1964. This was at a time when 4 [[leptons]] had been discovered but only 3 quarks proposed. The development of their work in 1970, the [[GIM mechanism]] showed that the two quark pairs: (d.s), (u,c), would largely cancel out flavor changing neutral currents, which  had been observed experimentally at far lower levels than theoretically predicted on the basis of 3 quarks only. The prediction of the charm quark also removed a technical disaster for any quantum field theory with unequal numbers of quarks and leptons — an [[Anomaly (physics)|anomaly]] — where classical field theory symmetries fail to carry over into the quantum theory.

In 1973, Glashow and [[Howard Georgi]] proposed the first [[grand unified theory]]. They discovered how to fit the gauge forces in the [[standard model]] into an SU(5) group, and the quarks and leptons into two simple representations. Their theory qualitatively predicted the general pattern of [[coupling constant]] running, with plausible assumptions, it gave rough mass ratio values between third generation leptons and quarks, and it was the first indication that the law of [[Baryon number]] is inexact, that the [[proton]] is unstable. This work was the foundation for all future unifying work.

Glashow shared the 1977 [[J. Robert Oppenheimer Memorial Prize]] with [[Feza Gürsey]].<ref>{{cite book| title= Winners, the blue ribbon encyclopedia of awards | url= https://archive.org/details/winnersblueribbo0000walt | url-access= registration |last=Walter |first=Claire |year=1982 |page= [https://archive.org/details/winnersblueribbo0000walt/page/438 438]|publisher=Facts on File Inc.|isbn=9780871963864 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Gürsey and Glashow share Oppenheimer memorial |journal=Physics Today |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=95 |publisher=American Institute of Physics |date=May 1977 |doi=10.1063/1.3037556 }}</ref>

==Criticism of superstring theory==
Glashow is a skeptic of [[superstring]] theory due to its lack of experimentally testable predictions. He had campaigned to keep string theorists out of the [[Harvard]] physics department, though the campaign failed.<ref name="newyorker">Jim Holt (2006-10-02), [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/10/02/061002crat_atlarge "Unstrung"], The New Yorker. Retrieved on 2012-07-27.</ref> About ten minutes into "String's the Thing", the second episode of ''[[The Elegant Universe]]'' TV series, he describes superstring theory as a discipline distinct from physics, saying "...you may call it a tumor, if you will...".<ref>"[T]here ain't no experiment that could be done nor is there any observation that could be made that would say, `You guys are wrong.' The theory is safe, permanently safe." He also said, "Is this a theory of Physics or Philosophy? I ask you" [http://pbs.org/wgbh/nova/elegant/view-glashow.html NOVA interview]</ref>

==Personal life==
Glashow is married to Joan Shirley Alexander. They have four children.<ref name="nobel-bio" /> [[Lynn Margulis]] was Joan's sister, making [[Carl Sagan]] his former brother-in-law. [[Daniel Kleitman]], who was another doctoral student of [[Julian Schwinger]], is also his brother-in-law, through Joan's other sister, Sharon.

In 2003, he was one of 22 Nobel Laureates who signed the [[Humanism and Its Aspirations|Humanist Manifesto]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/Humanism/Humanist_Manifesto_III/Notable_Signers | title=Notable Signers | publisher=American Humanist Association | work=Humanism and Its Aspirations | access-date=October 2, 2012}}</ref> Glashow has described himself as a "practising [[atheist]]" and a Democrat.<ref>Sheldon Glashow, Nobel Prize in Physics for the Electroweak Theory . La Vanguardia, 20 June 2017, raed.academy/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Sheldon-Lee-Glashow-contraLVeng.pdf.</ref>

Glashow is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President [[George W. Bush]] in May 2008, urging him to "reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill" by requesting additional emergency funding for the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]’s [[Office of Science]], the [[National Science Foundation]], and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=A Letter from America's Physics Nobel Laureates|url=https://fire.pppl.gov/nobel_bush_fy08_050808.pdf}}</ref>
