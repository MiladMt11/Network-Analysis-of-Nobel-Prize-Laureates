'''Luis Walter Alvarez''' (June 13, 1911 – September 1, 1988) was an American [[experimental physicist]], [[inventor]], and [[professor]] who was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1968 for development of the [[Bubble chamber|hydrogen bubble chamber]] enabling discovery of resonance states in particle physics. The ''[[American Journal of Physics]]'' commented, "Luis Alvarez was one of the most brilliant and productive experimental physicists of the twentieth century."<ref name=AJP>{{cite journal | last=Wohl | first=C.

After receiving his [[PhD]] from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1936, Alvarez went to work for [[Ernest Lawrence]] at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Lab|Radiation Laboratory]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Alvarez devised a set of experiments to observe K-[[electron capture]] in [[radioactivity|radioactive nuclei]], predicted by the [[beta decay]] theory but never before observed. He produced [[tritium]] using the [[cyclotron]] and measured its lifetime. In collaboration with [[Felix Bloch]], he measured the [[Neutron magnetic moment|magnetic moment of the neutron]].

In 1940, Alvarez joined the [[MIT Radiation Laboratory]], where he contributed to a number of [[World War II]] [[radar]] projects, from early improvements to [[Identification friend or foe]] (IFF) radar beacons, now called [[transponder]]s, to a system known as VIXEN for preventing enemy submarines from realizing that they had been found by the new airborne [[microwave]] radars. Enemy submarines would wait until the radar signal was getting strong and then submerge, escaping attack. But VIXEN transmitted a radar signal whose strength was the cube of the distance to the submarine so that as they approached the sub, the signal—as measured by the sub—got progressively weaker, and the sub assumed the plane was getting farther away and didn't submerge.<ref>Alvarez, L.

Alvarez spent a few months at the [[University of Chicago]] working on [[nuclear reactor]]s for [[Enrico Fermi]] before coming to [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] to work for [[Robert Oppenheimer]] on the [[Manhattan project]]. Alvarez worked on the design of [[explosive lens]]es, and the development of [[exploding-bridgewire detonator]]s. As a member of [[Project Alberta]], he observed the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]] from a [[B-29 Superfortress]], and later the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|bombing of Hiroshima]] from the B-29 ''[[The Great Artiste]]''.

After the war Alvarez was involved in the design of a [[liquid hydrogen]] [[bubble chamber]] that allowed his team to take millions of photographs of particle interactions, develop complex computer systems to measure and analyze these interactions, and discover entire families of new particles and [[resonance (particle physics)|resonance states]]. This work resulted in his being awarded the Nobel Prize in 1968. He was involved in a project to [[x-ray]] the [[Egyptian pyramids]] to search for unknown chambers. With his son, geologist [[Walter Alvarez]], he developed the [[Alvarez hypothesis]] which proposes that the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|extinction event]] that wiped out the non-avian dinosaurs was the result of an asteroid impact.

Alvarez was a member of the [[JASON (advisory group)|JASON Defense Advisory Group]], the [[Bohemian Club]], and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].{{sfn|Trower|2009|p=13}}

== Early life ==
Luis Walter Alvarez was born in San Francisco on June 13, 1911, the second child and oldest son of [[Walter C. Alvarez]], a physician, and his wife Harriet née Smyth, and a grandson of [[Luis F. Álvarez]], a Spanish physician, born in Asturias, Spain, who lived in Cuba for a while and finally settled in the United States, who found a better method for diagnosing [[Leprosy#Classification|macular leprosy]]. He had an older sister, Gladys, a younger brother, Bob, and a younger sister, Bernice.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=9–10}} His aunt, [[Mabel Alvarez]], was a California artist specializing in [[oil painting]].<ref name="AAA">{{cite web | last=Fernandez | first=R.

He attended Madison School in San Francisco from 1918 to 1924, and then [[San Francisco Polytechnic High School]].{{sfn|Trower|1987 | p=259}} In 1926, his father became a researcher at the [[Mayo Clinic]], and the family moved to [[Rochester, Minnesota]], where Alvarez attended Rochester High School. He had always expected to attend the [[University of California, Berkeley]], but at the urging of his teachers at Rochester, he instead went to the [[University of Chicago]],{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=12–16}} where he received his bachelor's degree in 1932, his master's degree in 1934, and his [[PhD]] in 1936.<ref name=Nobel /> As an undergraduate, he belonged to the [[Phi Gamma Delta]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]]. As a postgraduate he moved to [[Gamma Alpha]].{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=23–24}}

In 1932, as a [[graduate student]] at Chicago, he discovered physics there and had the rare opportunity to use the equipment of legendary physicist [[Albert A. Michelson]].<ref name="Bortz2007">Alfred B. Bortz. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TKx7uAAACAAJ Physics: Decade by Decade]''. Facts On File, Incorporated; 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-8160-5532-6}}. p. 168.</ref> Alvarez also constructed an apparatus of [[Geiger counter]] tubes arranged as a [[Cosmic-ray observatory|cosmic ray telescope]], and under the aegis of his faculty advisor [[Arthur Compton]], conducted an experiment in Mexico City to measure the so-called [[Cosmic ray#Identification|East–West effect of cosmic rays]]. Observing more incoming radiation from the west, Alvarez concluded that primary cosmic rays were positively charged. Compton submitted the resulting paper to the ''[[Physical Review]]'', with Alvarez's name at the top.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=25–27}}

Alvarez was an agnostic.<ref>Alvarez: adventures of a physicist. Basic Books. 1987. p. 279. {{ISBN|9780465001156}}. "Physicists feel that the subject of religion is taboo. Almost all consider themselves agnostics. We talk about the big bang that started the present universe and wonder what caused it and what came before. To me the idea of a Supreme Being is attractive, but I'm sure that such a Being isn't the one described in any holy book. Since we learn about people by examining what they have done, I conclude that any Supreme Being must have been a great mathematician. The universe operates with precision according to mathematical laws of enormous complexity. I'm unable to identify its creator with the Jesus to whom my maternal grandparents, missionaries in China, devoted their lives."</ref>

== Early work ==
[[File:Alvarez and Compton.jpeg|thumb|Nobel Laureate Arthur Compton, left, with young graduate student Luis Alvarez at the University of Chicago in 1933]]
Alvarez's sister, Gladys, worked for [[Ernest Lawrence]] as a part-time secretary, and mentioned Alvarez to Lawrence. Lawrence then invited Alvarez to tour the [[Century of Progress]] exhibition in Chicago with him.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | p=31}} After he completed his [[oral exam]]s in 1936, Alvarez, now engaged to be married to Geraldine Smithwick, asked his sister to see if Lawrence had any jobs available at the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Lab|Radiation Laboratory]]. A telegram soon arrived from Gladys with a job offer from Lawrence. This started a long association with the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Alvarez and Smithwick were married in one of the chapels at the University of Chicago and then headed for California.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | p=38}} They had two children, [[Walter Alvarez|Walter]] and Jean.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | p=284}} They were divorced in 1957. On December 28, 1958, he married Janet L. Landis, and had two more children, Donald and Helen.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=205–207, 281}}

At the Radiation Laboratory he worked with Lawrence's experimental team, which was supported by a group of theoretical physicists headed by [[Robert Oppenheimer]].{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=46–48}} Alvarez devised a set of experiments to observe K-[[electron capture]] in [[radioactivity|radioactive nuclei]], predicted by the [[beta decay]] theory but never observed. Using [[magnet]]s to sweep aside the [[positron]]s and [[electron]]s emanating from his radioactive sources, he designed a special purpose Geiger counter to detect only the "soft" [[X-rays]] coming from K capture. He published his results in the ''[[Physical Review]]'' in 1937.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Alvarez | first=L. W. | year=1937 | title=Nuclear ''K'' Electron Capture | journal=[[Physical Review]] | volume=52 | issue=2 | pages=134–135 | bibcode=1937PhRv...52..134A | doi=10.1103/PhysRev.52.134}}</ref>{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=54–55}}

When [[deuterium]] (hydrogen-2) is bombarded with deuterium, the [[fusion reaction]] yields either [[tritium]] (hydrogen-3) plus a [[proton]] or [[helium-3]] plus a [[neutron]] ({{nowrap|{{SimpleNuclide|Hydrogen|2}} + {{SimpleNuclide|Hydrogen|2}} → {{SimpleNuclide|Hydrogen|3}} + p or {{SimpleNuclide|Helium|3}} + n}}). This is one of the most basic [[fusion reaction]]s, and the foundation of the [[thermonuclear weapon]] and the current research on [[controlled thermonuclear fusion|controlled nuclear fusion]]. At that time the stability of these two reaction products was unknown, but based on existing theories [[Hans Bethe]] thought that tritium would be stable and helium-3 unstable. Alvarez proved the reverse by using his knowledge of the details of the 60-inch [[cyclotron]] operation. He tuned the machine to accelerate doubly ionized helium-3 nuclei and was able to get a [[ion beam|beam of accelerated ions]], thus using the cyclotron as a kind of super [[mass spectrometer]]. As the accelerated helium came from deep [[gas well]]s where it had been for millions of years, the helium-3 component had to be stable. Afterwards Alvarez produced the radioactive tritium using the cyclotron and the {{nowrap|{{SimpleNuclide|Hydrogen|2}} + {{SimpleNuclide|Hydrogen|2}}}} reaction and measured its lifetime.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Alvarez | first1=L. W. | last2=Cornog |first2=R. | year=1939 | title=Helium and Hydrogen of Mass 3 | journal=[[Physical Review]] | volume=56 | issue=6 | pages=613 | bibcode=1939PhRv...56..613A | doi=10.1103/PhysRev.56.613}}</ref>{{sfn|Trower|2009 | p=6}}{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=67–71}}

In 1938, again using his knowledge of the cyclotron and inventing what are now known as [[time-of-flight]] techniques, Alvarez created a mono-energetic beam of [[thermal neutron]]s. With this he began a long series of experiments, collaborating with [[Felix Bloch]], to measure the [[Neutron magnetic moment|magnetic moment of the neutron]]. Their result of {{nowrap|μ<sub>0</sub> {{=}} {{val|1.93|0.02|u=[[Nuclear magneton|μ<sub>N</sub>]]}}}}, published in 1940, was a major advance over earlier work.<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Alvarez | first1=Luis W. | last2=Bloch |first2=F. | year=1940 | title=A Quantitative Determination of the Neutron Moment in Absolute Nuclear Magnetons | journal=[[Physical Review]] | volume=57 | issue=2 | pages=111–122 | bibcode=1940PhRv...57..111A | doi=10.1103/PhysRev.57.111}}</ref>

== World War II ==

=== Radiation Laboratory ===
The British [[Tizard Mission]] to the United States in 1940 demonstrated to leading American scientists the successful application of the [[cavity magnetron]] to produce short wavelength pulsed [[radar]]. The [[National Defense Research Committee]], established only months earlier by President [[Franklin Roosevelt]], created a central national laboratory at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) for the purpose of developing military applications of microwave radar. Lawrence immediately recruited his best "cyclotroneers", among them Alvarez, who joined this new laboratory, known as the [[Radiation Laboratory]], on November 11, 1940.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=78–85}} Alvarez contributed to a number of [[radar]] projects, from early improvements to [[Identification Friend or Foe]] (IFF) radar beacons, now called [[transponders]], to a system known as VIXEN for preventing enemy submarines from realizing that they had been found by the new airborne microwave radars.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=90–93}}

One of the first projects was to build equipment to transition from the British long-wave radar to the new microwave centimeter-band radar made possible by the [[cavity magnetron]]. In working on the [[Microwave Early Warning]] system (MEW), Alvarez invented a [[phased array|linear dipole array antenna]] that not only suppressed the unwanted [[side lobe]]s of the radiation field, but also could be electronically scanned without the need for mechanical scanning. This was the first microwave phased-array antenna, and Alvarez used it not only in MEW but in two additional radar systems. The antenna enabled the Eagle [[precision bombing]] radar to support precision bombing in bad weather or through clouds. It was completed rather late in the war; although a number of [[B-29]]s were equipped with Eagle and it worked well, it came too late to make much difference.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=101–103}}

[[File:Luis Alvarez with president Harry Truman.jpg|thumb|Receiving the [[Collier Trophy]] from President [[Harry Truman]], White House, 1946]]
The radar system for which Alvarez is best known and which has played a major role in aviation, most particularly in the post war [[Berlin airlift]], was [[Ground Controlled Approach]] (GCA). Using Alvarez's dipole antenna to achieve a very high [[angular resolution]], GCA allows ground-based radar operators watching special precision displays to guide a landing airplane to the runway by transmitting verbal commands to the pilot. The system was simple, direct, and worked well, even with previously untrained pilots. It was so successful that the military continued to use it for many years after the war, and it was still in use in some countries in the 1980s.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=96–100}} Alvarez was awarded the [[National Aeronautic Association]]'s [[Collier Trophy]] in 1945 "for his conspicuous and outstanding initiative in the concept and development of the Ground Control Approach system for safe landing of aircraft under all weather and traffic conditions".<ref>{{cite web | title=Collier 1940–1949 Winners | url=http://naa.aero/html/awards/index.cfm?cmsid=156 | publisher=[[National Aeronautic Association]] | access-date=March 21, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203122514/http://naa.aero/html/awards/index.cfm?cmsid=156 | archive-date=December 3, 2013 | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/38806783/the_courierjournal/|title=Radar Expert will Receive Collier Trophy|date=December 13, 1946|newspaper=The Courier-Journal|location=Louisville, Kentucky|page=16|via=Newspapers.com|agency=Associated Press}}</ref>

Alvarez spent the summer of 1943 in England testing GCA, landing planes returning from battle in bad weather, and also training the British in the use of the system. While there he encountered the young [[Arthur C. Clarke]], who was an RAF radar technician. Clarke subsequently used his experiences at the radar research station as the basis for his novel ''[[Glide Path]]'', which contains a thinly disguised version of Alvarez.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=104–110}} Clarke and Alvarez developed a long-term friendship.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=110}}

=== Manhattan Project ===
In the fall of 1943, Alvarez returned to the United States with an offer from [[Robert Oppenheimer]] to work at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory|Los Alamos]] on the [[Manhattan project|Manhattan Project]]. However, Oppenheimer suggested that he first spend a few months at the [[University of Chicago]] working with [[Enrico Fermi]] before coming to Los Alamos. During these months, General [[Leslie Groves]] asked Alvarez to think of a way that the US could find out if the Germans were operating any [[nuclear reactor]]s, and, if so, where they were. Alvarez suggested that an airplane could carry a system to detect the radioactive gases that a reactor produces, particularly [[xenon 133|xenon-133]]. The equipment did fly over Germany, but detected no radioactive xenon because the Germans had not built a reactor capable of a chain reaction. This was the first idea of monitoring [[fission product]]s for [[intelligence gathering]]. It would become extremely important after the war.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=114–121}}

[[File:Luis Alvarez - Flak Jacket.JPG|thumb|left|Wearing a helmet and [[flak jacket]] and standing in front of ''[[The Great Artiste]]'', [[Tinian]] 1945]]
As a result of his radar work and the few months spent with Fermi, Alvarez arrived at Los Alamos in the spring of 1944, later than many of his contemporaries. The work on the "[[Little Boy]]" (a uranium bomb) was far along so Alvarez became involved in the design of the "[[Fat Man]]" (a plutonium bomb). The technique used for uranium, that of forcing the two sub-[[critical mass]]es together using a [[Gun-type fission weapon|type of gun]], would not work with plutonium because the high level of background [[spontaneous fission|spontaneous neutrons]] would cause fissions as soon as the two parts approached each other, so heat and expansion would force the system apart before much energy has been released. It was decided to use a nearly critical sphere of [[plutonium]] and compress it quickly by explosives into a much smaller and denser [[plutonium core|core]], a technical challenge at the time.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=123–128}}

To create the symmetrical [[nuclear weapon design|implosion]] required to compress the plutonium core to the required density, thirty two explosive charges were to be simultaneously detonated around the spherical core. Using conventional explosive techniques with [[blasting cap]]s, progress towards achieving simultaneity to within a small fraction of a microsecond was discouraging. Alvarez directed his graduate student, [[Lawrence H. Johnston]], to use a large [[capacitor]] to deliver a [[high voltage]] charge directly to each [[explosive lens]], replacing blasting caps with [[exploding-bridgewire detonator]]s. The exploding wire detonated the thirty two charges to within a few tenths of a microsecond. The invention was critical to the success of the [[implosion-type nuclear weapon]]. He also supervised the [[RaLa Experiment]]s.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=131–136}} Alvarez later wrote that:
{{quote|With modern weapons-grade uranium, the background neutron rate is so low that terrorists, if they had such material, would have a good chance of setting off a high-yield explosion simply by dropping one half of the material onto the other half. Most people seem unaware that if separated [[uranium-235|U-235]] is at hand, it's a trivial job to set off a nuclear explosion, whereas if only plutonium is available, making it explode is the most difficult technical job I know.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | p=125}} }}

[[File:Agnew on Tinian.jpg|thumb|Alvarez (top right) on Tinian with [[Harold Agnew]] (top left), [[Lawrence H. Johnston]] (bottom left) and [[Bernard Waldman]] (bottom right)]]

Again working with Johnston, Alvarez's last task for the [[Manhattan Project]] was to develop a set of calibrated [[microphone]]/[[transmitter]]s to be parachuted from an aircraft to measure the strength of the blast wave from the atomic explosion, so as to allow the scientists to calculate the bomb's energy. After being commissioned as a [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in the [[United States Army]], he observed the [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity nuclear test]] from a [[B-29 Superfortress]] that also carried fellow [[Project Alberta]] members [[Harold Agnew]] and [[Deak Parsons]] (who were respectively commissioned at the rank of [[Captain (United States O-3)|captain]]).{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=137–142}}

Flying in the [[B-29 Superfortress]] ''[[The Great Artiste]]'' in formation with the ''[[Enola Gay]]'', Alvarez and Johnston measured the blast effect of the [[Little Boy]] bomb which was [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropped on Hiroshima]].{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=6–8}} A few days later, again flying in ''The Great Artiste'', Johnston used the same equipment to measure the strength of the [[Nagasaki bomb|Nagasaki]] explosion.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=144–146}}

== Bubble chamber ==
[[File:Luis Alvarez - Nobel with Balloon.jpg|thumb|upright|Celebrating winning the Nobel Prize, October 30, 1968. The balloons are inscribed with the names of subatomic particles that his group discovered.]]

Returning to the University of California, Berkeley as a [[full professor]], Alvarez had many ideas about how to use his wartime radar knowledge to improve [[particle accelerator]]s. Though some of these were to bear fruit, the "big idea" of this time would come from [[Edwin McMillan]] with his concept of [[Synchrocyclotron|phase stability]] which led to the [[synchrocyclotron]]. Refining and extending this concept, the Lawrence team would build the world's then-largest proton accelerator, the [[Bevatron]], which began operating in 1954. Though the Bevatron could produce copious amounts of interesting particles, particularly in secondary collisions, these complex interactions were hard to detect and analyze at the time.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=153–159}}

Seizing upon a new development to visualize particle tracks, created by [[Donald A. Glaser|Donald Glaser]] and known as a [[bubble chamber]], Alvarez realized the device was just what was needed, if only it could be made to function with [[liquid hydrogen]]. [[Hydrogen]] nuclei, which are [[proton]]s, made the simplest and most desirable target for interactions with the particles produced by the Bevatron. He began a development program to build a series of small chambers, and championed the device to Ernest Lawrence.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=185–189}}

The Glaser device was a small glass cylinder ({{nowrap|1 cm × 2 cm}}) filled with [[diethyl ether|ether]]. By suddenly reducing the pressure in the device, the liquid could be placed into a temporary [[superheated]] state, which would boil along the disturbed track of a particle passing through. Glaser was able to maintain the superheated state for a few seconds before spontaneous boiling took place. The Alvarez team built chambers of 1.5&nbsp;in, 2.5&nbsp;in, 4&nbsp;in, 10&nbsp;in, and 15&nbsp;in using liquid hydrogen, and constructed of metal with glass windows, so that the tracks could be photographed. The chamber could be cycled in synchronization with the accelerator beam, a picture could be taken, and the chamber recompressed in time for the next beam cycle.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=190–194}}

This program built a liquid hydrogen bubble chamber almost 7 feet (2 meters) long, employed dozens of physicists and graduate students together with hundreds of engineers and technicians, took millions of photographs of particle interactions, developed computer systems to measure and analyze the interactions, and discovered families of new particles and [[resonance (particle physics)|resonance states]]. This work resulted in the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for Alvarez in 1968,{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=196–199}} "For his decisive contributions to elementary particle physics, in particular the discovery of a large number of resonant states, made possible through his development of the technique of using hydrogen bubble chambers and data analysis."<ref name= Royal>{{cite web | title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1968 | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1968/ | publisher=[[The Nobel Foundation]] | access-date=March 21, 2013}}</ref>

In 1964 Alvarez proposed what became known as the [[High Altitude Particle Physics Experiment]] (HAPPE), originally conceived as a large [[superconducting magnet]] carried to high altitude by a [[balloon]] in order to study extremely high-energy particle interactions.<ref name="Memo503">{{cite journal | last=Alvarez | first=L.

This work was a large effort, carrying detectors aloft with [[high-altitude balloon]] flights and high-flying [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] aircraft, and an early precursor of the [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] satellite-born experiments on the cosmic background radiation (which resulted in the award of the 2006 Nobel Prize, shared by [[George Smoot]] and [[John C. Mather|John Mather]].<ref name="Memo503" />)

Alvarez proposed [[Muon tomography]] in 1965 to search the [[Egyptian pyramids]] for unknown chambers. Using naturally occurring [[cosmic ray]]s, his plan was to place [[spark-chamber detector|spark chambers]], standard equipment in the high-energy [[particle physics]] of this time, beneath the [[Pyramid of Khafre]] in a known chamber. By measuring the counting rate of the cosmic rays in different directions the detector would reveal the existence of any void in the overlaying rock structure.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Alvarez | first=L.

Alvarez assembled a team of physicists and archeologists from the United States and Egypt, the recording equipment was constructed and the experiment carried out, though it was interrupted by the 1967 [[Six-Day War]]. Restarted after the war, the effort continued, recording and analyzing the penetrating cosmic rays until 1969 when Alvarez reported to the [[American Physical Society]] that no chambers had been found in the 19% of the pyramid surveyed.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=232–236}}

In November 1966 ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' published a series of photographs from the [[Zapruder film|film]] that [[Abraham Zapruder]] took of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|Kennedy assassination]]. Alvarez, an expert in optics and [[photoanalysis]], became intrigued by the pictures and began to study what could be learned from the film. Alvarez demonstrated both in theory and experiment that the backward snap of the President's head was consistent with his being shot from behind being called the "jet-effect" theory. Prominent conspiracy theorists attempted to refute his experiment - see Last Second in Dallas by Josiah Thompson, however, doctor Nicholas Nalli, Ph.D supports Alvarez's theory which is consistent with a shot from behind.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nalli |first1=Nicholas R. |title=Gunshot-wound dynamics model for John F.

{{Main|Alvarez hypothesis}}
[[File:LWA with Walt.JPG|thumb|right|Luis and [[Walter Alvarez]] at the [[K-T Boundary]] in [[Gubbio, Italy]], 1981]]

In 1980 Alvarez and his son, geologist [[Walter Alvarez]], along with nuclear chemists [[Frank Asaro]] and [[Helen Michel]], "uncovered a calamity that literally shook the Earth and is one of the great discoveries about Earth's history".<ref name=AJP />

During the 1970s, Walter Alvarez was doing geologic research in central Italy. There he had located an outcrop on the walls of a gorge whose [[limestone]] layers included [[stratum|strata]] both above and below the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]]. Exactly at the boundary is a thin layer of [[clay]]. Walter told his father that the layer marked where the [[dinosaur]]s and much else became extinct and that nobody knew why, or what the clay was about—it was a big mystery and he intended to solve it.<ref name=AJP />

Alvarez had access to the [[nuclear chemistry|nuclear chemists]] at the [[Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory]] and was able to work with [[Frank Asaro]] and [[Helen Michel]], who used the technique of [[neutron activation analysis]]. In 1980, Alvarez, Alvarez, Asaro, and Michel published a seminal paper proposing an extraterrestrial cause for the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (then called the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction).<ref>{{cite journal | last1=Alvarez | first1=L. W. | last2=Alvarez |first2=W. | last3=Asaro |first3=F. | last4=Michel |first4=H. V. | year=1980 | title=Extraterrestrial Cause for the Cretaceous-Tertiary Extinction: Experiment and Theory | url=http://www.es.ucsc.edu/~pkoch/EART_206/09-0305/Alvarez%20et%2080%20Science%20208-1095.pdf | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=208 | issue=4448 | pages=1095–1108 | bibcode=1980Sci...208.1095A | doi=10.1126/science.208.4448.1095 | jstor=1683699 | pmid=17783054| s2cid=16017767 }}</ref> In the years following the publication of their article, the clay was also found to contain [[soot]], [[glass]]y spherules, [[shocked quartz]] crystals, microscopic [[diamond]]s, and rare minerals formed only under conditions of great temperature and pressure.<ref name= AJP />

Publication of the 1980 paper brought criticism from the geologic community, and an often acrimonious scientific debate ensued. Ten years later, and after Alvarez's death, evidence of a large [[impact crater]] called [[Chicxulub Crater|Chicxulub]] was found off the coast of Mexico, providing support for the theory. Other researchers later found that the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event|end-Cretaceous extinction]] of the dinosaurs may have occurred rapidly in geologic terms, over thousands of years, rather than millions of years as had previously been supposed. Others continue to study alternative extinction causes such as increased [[volcanism]], particularly the massive [[Deccan Traps]] eruptions that occurred around the same time, and [[climate change]], checking against the [[fossil]] record. However, on March 4, 2010, a panel of 41 scientists agreed that the Chicxulub asteroid impact triggered the mass extinction.<ref name="Schulte10">{{cite journal | last=Schulte | first=P. | year=2010 | title=The Chicxulub Asteroid Impact and Mass Extinction at the Cretaceous- Paleogene Boundary | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume=327 | issue=5970 | pages=1214–1218 | bibcode=2010Sci...327.1214S | doi=10.1126/science.1177265 | pmid=20203042| s2cid=2659741 |display-authors=etal| url=http://doc.rero.ch/record/210367/files/PAL_E4389.pdf }}</ref>

== Aviation ==
In his autobiography, Alvarez said, "I think of myself as having had two separate careers, one in science and one in aviation. I've found the two almost equally rewarding." An important contributor to this was his enjoyment of flying. He learned to fly in 1933, later earning [[instrument rating|instrument]] and multi-engine ratings. Over the next 50 years he accumulated over 1000 hours of flight time, most of it as pilot in command.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987|pp=30–31}} He said, "I found few activities as satisfying as being pilot in command with responsibility for my passengers' lives."{{sfn|Alvarez|1987|pp=268}}

Alvarez made numerous professional contributions to aviation. During World War II he led the development of multiple aviation-related technologies. Several of his projects are described above, including Ground Controlled Approach (GCA) for which he was awarded the Collier Trophy in 1945. He also held the basic patent for the radar [[transponder]], for which he assigned rights to the U.S. government for $1.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987|pp=30–31}}

Later in his career Alvarez served on multiple high level advisory committees related to civilian and military aviation. These included a [[Federal Aviation Administration]] task group on future [[air navigation]] and [[air traffic control]] systems, the [[President's Science Advisory Committee]] Military Aircraft Panel, and a committee studying how the scientific community could help improve the United States' capabilities for fighting a nonnuclear war.{{sfn|Alvarez|1987|pp=218–223}}

Alvarez's aviation responsibilities led to many adventures. For example, while working on GCA he became the first civilian to fly a low approach with his view outside the cockpit obstructed. He also flew many military aircraft from the co-pilot's seat, including a [[B-29 Superfortress]]{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=268}} and a [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter]].{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=224}} In addition, he survived a crash during World War II as a passenger in a [[Miles Master]].{{sfn|Alvarez|1987 | pp=108}}

== Death ==
Alvarez died on September 1, 1988, of complications from a succession of recent operations for [[esophageal cancer]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sullivan |first1=Walter |title=Luis W.
