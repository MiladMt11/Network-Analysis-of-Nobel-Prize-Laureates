==Biography==

===Early years===
'''Hevesy György''' was born in [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]], to a wealthy and ennobled family of [[Hungarian-Jewish]] descent,<ref name=Hilger>{{Citation|last=Levi|first=Hilde|title=George de Hevesy : life and work : a biography|year=1985|publisher=A. Hilger|location=Bristol |isbn=978-0-85274-555-7|page=14}}</ref> the fifth of eight children to his parents Lajos Bischitz and Baroness Eugénia (Jenny) Schossberger (ennobled as "De Tornya"). Grandparents from both sides of the family had provided the presidents of the Jewish community of [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]].<ref name=Hilger/> His parents converted to [[Roman Catholicism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/George-de-Hevesy-Nobel-Prize-in-Chemistry-1943/6000000013761368687|title=George de Hevesy, Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1943|website=geni_family_tree}}</ref> George grew up in Budapest and graduated high school in 1903 from Piarista Gimnázium. The family's name in 1904 was Hevesy-Bischitz, and Hevesy later changed his own.

De Hevesy began his studies in chemistry at the [[University of Budapest]] for one year, and at the [[Technical University of Berlin]] for several months, but transferred to the [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg|University of Freiburg]]. There he met [[Ludwig Gattermann]]. In 1906, he started his Ph.D. thesis with Georg Franz Julius Meyer,<ref name=Norrby>{{Citation|last=Norrby|first=Erling|year=2013|title=Nobel Prizes and Nature's Surprises
}}</ref> acquiring his doctorate in physics in 1908. In 1908, Hevesy was offered a position at the [[ETH Zürich]], Switzerland, yet being independently wealthy, he was able to choose his research environment. In succession he worked with [[Fritz Haber]] in [[Karlsruhe, Germany]], then with [[Ernest Rutherford]] in [[Manchester, England]], where he also met [[Niels Bohr]]. Back at home in [[Budapest]], he was appointed professor in [[physical chemistry]] in 1918. In 1920, he settled in Copenhagen.

===Research===
In 1922, de Hevesy co-discovered (with [[Dirk Coster]]) the element [[hafnium]] (<sub>72</sub>Hf) ([[Latin]] ''Hafnia'' for "[[Copenhagen]]", the home town of [[Niels Bohr]]). [[Dmitri Mendeleev|Mendeleev]]'s 1869 [[periodic table]] arranged the chemical elements into a logical system, but a chemical element with 72 protons was missing. Hevesy determined to look for that element on the basis of Bohr's atomic model. The mineralogical museum of Norway and Greenland in Copenhagen furnished the material for the research.  Characteristic [[X-ray spectrum|X-ray spectra]] recordings made of the sample indicated that a new element was present. The accepted account has been disputed by Mansel Davies and [[Eric Scerri]] who attribute the prediction that element 72 would be a [[transition element]] to the chemist Charles Bury.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Supported financially by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]], Hevesy had a very productive year. He developed the [[X-ray fluorescence]] analytical method, and discovered the [[samarium]] alpha-ray. It was here he began the use of [[radioactive isotope]]s in studying the metabolic processes of plants and animals, by tracing chemicals in the body by replacing part of stable isotopes with small quantities of the radioactive isotopes. In 1923, Hevesy published the first study on the use of the naturally radioactive <sup>212</sup>Pb as radioactive tracer to follow the absorption and [[Translocation (botany)|translocation]] in the roots, stems and leaves of [[Vicia faba]], also known as the broad bean.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1 = Myers | first1 = W.

In 1924, Hevesy returned to Freiburg as Professor of Physical Chemistry, and in 1930 went to [[Cornell University, Ithaca]] as Baker Lecturer. Four years later he resumed his activities at Niels Bohr's Institute, based there through 1952. During 1936, he invented [[Neutron activation analysis|Neutron Activation Analysis]]. During 1943 he was domiciled in Stockholm and was an Associate of the Institute of Research in Organic Chemistry. In 1949 he was elected Franqui Professor in the [[University of Ghent]]. In his retirement, he remained an active scientific associate of the [[University of Stockholm]]. Hevesy was offered and accepted a job from the University of Freiburg.

==World War II and beyond==

[[File:Georg und Pia von Hevesy Stolpersteine.jpg|thumb|[[Stolperstein]]e for Georg and his wife Pia de Hevesy]]
Prior to the onset of World War II, [[Max von Laue]] and [[James Franck]] had sent their gold [[Nobel Prize]]s to [[Denmark]] to keep them from being confiscated by the Nazis.  After the [[Denmark in World War II|Nazi invasion of Denmark]] this placed them in danger; it was illegal at the time to send gold out of Germany, and were it discovered that Laue and Franck had done so, they could have faced prosecution.  To prevent this, de Hevesy concealed the medals by dissolving them with [[aqua regia]] and placing the resulting solution on a shelf in his laboratory at the [[Niels Bohr Institute]]. After the war, he returned to find the solution undisturbed and precipitated the gold out of the acid. The Nobel Society then recast the Nobel Prizes using the original gold.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://archive.org/stream/adventuresinradi01heve#page/27/mode/1up/search/medals |title=Adventures in radioisotope research|first=George |last=Hevesy|publisher=Pergamon press|location=New York|year=1962|volume=1|page=27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | publisher = The Nobel Foundation | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/about/medals/ | author = Birgitta Lemmel | title = The Nobel Prize Medals and the Medal for the Prize in Economics | year = 2006}}</ref>

By 1943, Copenhagen was no longer safe for a Jewish scientist and de Hevesy fled to Sweden, where he worked at the [[Stockholm University College]] until 1961. In Stockholm de Hevesy was received at the department of chemistry by the Swedish professor and Nobel Prize winner [[Hans von Euler-Chelpin]], who remained strongly pro-German throughout the war. Despite this, de Hevesy and von Euler-Chelpin collaborated on many scientific papers during and after the war.

While he was in Stockholm, de Hevesy received the Nobel Prize in chemistry. He was later inducted into the Royal Society and received the [[Copley Medal]], of which he was particularly proud. De Hevesy stated: "The public thinks the Nobel Prize in chemistry for the highest honor that a scientist can receive, but it is not so. Forty or fifty received Nobel chemistry prizes, but only ten foreign members of the Royal Society and two (Bohr and Hevesy) received a medal-Copley." George de Hevesy was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1942, and his status was later changed to Swedish member. He received the [[Atoms for Peace Award]] in 1958 for his peaceful use of [[radioactive isotope]]s.

==Family life and death==

De Hevesy married Pia Riis in 1924. They had one son and three daughters together, one of whom (Eugenie) married a grandson of the Swedish Nobel laureate [[Svante Arrhenius]].<ref>Scripps Log obituaries, http://scilib.ucsd.edu/sio/biogr/ScrippsLogObits.pdf</ref> De Hevesy died in 1966 at the age of eighty and was buried in Freiburg. In 2000, his corpse was transferred to the [[Kerepesi Cemetery]] in Budapest, Hungary. He had published a total of 397 scientific documents, one of which was the Becquerel-Curie Memorial Lecture, in which he had reminisced about the careers of pioneers of radiochemistry.<ref>{{Citation|pmid=13714019|year=1961|last1=De Hevesy|first1= George C.|title=Marie Curie and her contemporaries|volume=2|pages=169–82|journal=Journal of Nuclear Medicine|url=http://jnm.snmjournals.org/content/25/1/116.full.pdf}}</ref> At his family's request, his ashes were interred at his birthplace in Budapest on 19 April 2001.

On 10 May 2005 the Hevesy Laboratory<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150402100449/http://www.nutech.dtu.dk/english/Research/Hevesy-Laboratory Hevesy Laboratory]</ref> was founded at [[Risø DTU National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy|Risø National Laboratory for Sustainable Energy]], now [[Technical University of Denmark]],  DTU Nutech. It was named after George de Hevesy as the father of the isotope tracer principle by the initiative of the lab's first head Prof. Mikael Jensen.
