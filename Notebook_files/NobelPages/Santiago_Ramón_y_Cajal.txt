'''Santiago Ramón y Cajal''' ({{IPA-es|sanˈtjaɣo raˈmon i kaˈxal|lang}}; 1 May 1852 – 17 October 1934)<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0" /> was a Spanish [[neuroscience|neuroscientist]], [[pathology|pathologist]], and [[Histology|histologist]] specializing in [[neuroanatomy]] and the [[central nervous system]]. He and [[Camillo Golgi]] received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1906.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1906/cajal/biographical/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1906|website=NobelPrize.org}}</ref> Ramón y Cajal was the first person of Spanish origin to win a scientific [[Nobel Prize]]. His original investigations of the microscopic structure of the brain made him a pioneer of [[Neuroscience#Modern neuroscience|modern neuroscience]].

Hundreds of his drawings illustrating the [[dendrite|arborizations]] ("tree growing") of brain cells are still in use, since the mid-20th century, for educational and training purposes.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Neuroscience |publisher=Society for Neuroscience |url=http://www.sfn.org/index.cfm?pagename=HistoryofNeuroscience_main |access-date=2008-10-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080515121003/http://www.sfn.org/index.cfm?pagename=HistoryofNeuroscience_main |archive-date=2008-05-15 }}</ref>

==Biography==
Santiago Ramón y Cajal was born 1 May 1852 in the town of [[Petilla de Aragón]], [[Navarre]], [[Spain]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Santiago Ramón y Cajal: The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1906|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1906/cajal/biographical/|access-date=2020-06-25|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US}}</ref> As a child he was transferred many times from one school to another because of behavior that was declared poor, rebellious, and showing an anti-[[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] attitude. An extreme example of his precociousness and rebelliousness at the age of eleven is his 1863 imprisonment for destroying his neighbor's yard gate with a homemade cannon.<ref>Santiago Ramón y Cajal, [http://cvc.cervantes.es/ciencia/cajal/cajal_recuerdos/recuerdos/infancia_10.htm Recuerdos de mi Vida Volume I, Chapter X], Madrid Imprenta y Librería de N. Moya, Madrid 1917, online at Instituto Cervantes (Spanish)</ref> He was a keen painter, artist, and gymnast, but his father neither appreciated nor encouraged these abilities, even though these artistic talents would contribute to his success later in life.<ref name=":0" /> His father apprenticed him to a shoemaker and barber, to "try and give his son much-needed discipline and stability."<ref name=":0">{{cite book|title=A Mind for Numbers|publisher=Tarcher Penguin|isbn=978-0-399-16524-5|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780399165245/page/193 193]|year=2014|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780399165245/page/193}}</ref>[[File:Ramón y Cajal por Izquierdo Vives 1874 Museo del ejercito Toledo.jpg|thumb|Ramón y Cajal as a young captain in the [[Ten Years' War]] in [[Cuba]], 1874.|alt=|left]]

Over the summer of 1868, his father took him to graveyards to find human remains for anatomical study. Early sketches of bones moved him to pursue medical studies.<ref name=Finger2000/>{{rp|207}} Ramón y Cajal attended the medical school of the [[University of Zaragoza]], where his father worked as an anatomy teacher. He graduated in 1873, aged 21, and then served as a medical officer in the [[Spanish Army]]. He took part in an [[Ten Years' War|expedition to Cuba]] in 1874&ndash;75, where he contracted [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]].<ref name="Nobel_lectures">{{Nobelprize|accessdate=2020-04-29}}</ref> To aid his recovery, Ramón y Cajal spent time in the spa-town [[Panticosa]] in the [[Pyrenees]] mountain range.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

After returning to Spain, he received his doctorate in medicine in Madrid in 1877. Two years later, he became the director of the [[Zaragoza]] Museum, and he married Silveria Fañanás García, with whom he had seven daughters and five sons. Ramón y Cajal worked at the University of Zaragoza until 1883, when he was awarded the position of anatomy professor of the [[University of Valencia]].<ref name=Nobel_lectures/><ref>{{Cite web|title=Santiago Ramón y Cajal {{!}} Spanish histologist|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Santiago-Ramon-y-Cajal|access-date=2020-06-25|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>  His early work at these two universities focused on the pathology of inflammation, the microbiology of [[cholera]], and the structure of [[Epithelium|epithelial]] cells and tissues.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In 1887 Ramón y Cajal moved to [[Barcelona]] for a professorship.<ref name=Nobel_lectures/> There he first learned about [[Golgi's method]], a cell staining method which uses potassium dichromate and silver nitrate to (randomly) stain a few neurons a dark black color, while leaving the surrounding cells transparent. This method, which he improved, was central to his work, allowing him to turn his attention to the [[central nervous system]] (brain and spinal cord), in which neurons are so densely intertwined that standard microscopic inspection would be nearly impossible. During this period he made extensive detailed drawings of neural material, covering many species and most major regions of the brain.<ref name="Newman 2017 p. ">{{cite book | last=Newman | first=Eric | title=The beautiful brain : the drawings of Santiago Ramón y Cajal | publisher=Abrams | publication-place=New York | year=2017 | isbn=978-1-4197-2227-1 | oclc=938991305 | page=}}</ref>

In 1892, he became professor at Madrid.<ref name=Nobel_lectures/> In 1899 he became director of the ''Instituto Nacional de Higiene &ndash; ''translated as ''National Institute of Hygiene '', and in 1922 founder of the {{lang|es|Laboratorio de Investigaciones Biológicas}} &ndash; translated as the ''Laboratory of Biological Investigations '', later renamed to the {{lang|es|Instituto Cajal}}, or [[Cajal Institute]].<ref name=Nobel_lectures/>

===Political and religious views===
In 1877, the 25-year-old Ramón y Cajal joined a [[Masonic lodge]].<ref name=pin/>{{rp|156}} [[John Brande Trend]] wrote in 1965 that Ramón y Cajal "was a liberal in politics, an evolutionist in philosophy, an agnostic in religion".<ref>{{cite book|title=The Origins of Modern Spain|url=https://archive.org/details/originsofmoderns0000tren|url-access=registration|year=1965|publisher=Russell & Russell|author=John Brande Trend|page=[https://archive.org/details/originsofmoderns0000tren/page/82 82]|quote=Ramón y Cajal was a liberal in politics, an evolutionist in philosophy, an agnostic in religion...}}</ref>
 
Nonetheless, Ramón y Cajal used the term soul "without any shame".<ref>{{cite book|title=Educating the Whole Child for the Whole World: The Ross School Model and Education for the Global Era|url=https://archive.org/details/educatingwholech00suar|url-access=limited|year=2010|publisher=NYU Press| isbn=978-0-8147-4140-5| author=Carolyn Sattin-Bajaj|editor=Marcelo Suarez-Orozco|page=[https://archive.org/details/educatingwholech00suar/page/n175 165]|quote=In that sense, it was interesting to learn that Santiago Ramón y Cajal, the great pioneer of modern neuroanatomy, was agnostic, but still used the term soul without any shame.}}</ref> He was said to later have regretted having left organized religion,<ref name=pin>José María López Piñero, "Santiago Ramón y Cajal", Universita de València</ref>{{rp| 343}} Ultimately, he became convinced of a belief in God as a creator, as stated during his first lecture before the [[Spanish Royal Academy of Sciences]].<ref>[http://www.rac.es/ficheros/doc/00207.pdf DISCURSO DEL SR.

==Discoveries and theories==
[[File:Cajal-mi.jpg|thumb|right|Ramón y Cajal in his laboratory.]]

Ramón y Cajal made several major contributions to neuroanatomy.<ref name=Finger2000>{{cite book|last=Finger|first=Stanley|title=Minds behind the brain: A history of the pioneers and their discoveries.|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/mindsbehindbrain0000fing|chapter-url-access=registration|date=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-508571-X|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mindsbehindbrain0000fing/page/197 197–216]|chapter=Chapter 13: Santiago Ramón y Cajal. From nerve nets to neuron doctrine}}</ref> He discovered the axonal [[growth cone]], and demonstrated experimentally that the relationship between nerve cells was not ''continuous'', or a single system as per then extant [[reticular theory]], but rather ''contiguous'';<ref name=Finger2000 /> there were gaps between neurons. This provided definitive evidence for what [[Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Hartz|Heinrich Waldeyer]] would name "[[neuron theory]]", now widely considered the foundation of modern neuroscience.<ref name=Finger2000 /> He is also considered by some to be the first "neuroscientist" since in 1894 he stated to the [[Royal Society of London]]: “The ability of neurons to grow in an adult and their power to create new connections can explain learning.” This statement is considered to be the origin of the synaptic theory of memory.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Higgins, Edmund S.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1048335337|title=The neuroscience of clinical psychiatry : the pathophysiology of behavior and mental illness|others=George, Mark S.

He was an advocate of the existence of [[dendritic spines]], although he did not recognize them as the site of contact from presynaptic cells. He was a proponent of polarization of nerve cell function and his student, [[Rafael Lorente de Nó]], would continue this study of input-output systems into [[cable theory]] and some of the earliest circuit analysis of neural structures.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medsalud.com/biografias/santiago-ramon-y-cajal |title=Santiago Ramón y Cajal: biografía del médico español más célebre |publisher=medsalud.com |date= 2019-09-18|access-date=2019-09-19}}</ref>

By producing excellent depictions of neural structures and their connectivity and providing detailed descriptions of cell types he discovered a new type of cell, which was subsequently named after him, the [[interstitial cell of Cajal]] (ICC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anaesthetist.com/anaes/patient/ans/Findex.htm#ens.htm |title=FANZCA part I notes on the Autonomic Nervous System |publisher=Anaesthetist.com |access-date=2015-03-15}}</ref> This cell is found interleaved among neurons embedded within the [[smooth muscle tissue|smooth muscles]] lining the gut, serving as the generator and pacemaker of the [[catastalsis|slow waves of contraction]] which move [[chyme|material]] along the [[gastrointestinal tract]], mediating neurotransmission from motor neurons to smooth muscle cells.

In his 1894 [[Croonian Lecture]], Ramón y Cajal suggested (in an extended metaphor) that cortical [[pyramidal cells]] may become more elaborate with time, as a tree grows and extends its branches.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

He devoted a considerable amount of time studying French  which he used to help his wife during labor and parapsychological phenomena.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} A book he had written on these topics was lost during the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In 2020, over 75 volunteers collaborated as part of The Cajal Embroidery Project across 6 countries to create 81 intricate, exquisite hand-stitched panels of Ramón y Cajal's images, which were then curated and displayed by [https://www.edinburghneuroscience.ed.ac.uk/ Edinburgh Neuroscience] at the virtual FENS 2020 Forum, and showcased by ''The Lancet Neurology'' in their front covers in 2021.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Mehta|first1=Arpan R|last2=Abbott|first2=Catherine M|last3=Chandran|first3=Siddharthan|last4=Haley|first4=Jane E|date=December 2020|title=The Cajal Embroidery Project: celebrating neuroscience|url= |journal=The Lancet Neurology|language=en|volume=19|issue=12|pages=979|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(20)30348-3|pmc=7116532|pmid=32949529}}</ref>

In 2017, UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) recognised Cajal’s Legacy (which had been kept in a museum from 1945 to 1989) as a World Heritage treasure. Recognising that this cultural treasure deserves a dedicated museum, showcasing not only Cajal’s but also his disciples’ legacies, there has been a call for a dedicated museum to commemorate and celebrate Ramón y Cajal's discoveries and impact on neuroscience.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=DeFelipe|first1=Javier|last2=De Carlos|first2=Juan A|last3=Mehta|first3=Arpan R|date=January 2021|title=A museum for Cajal's Legacy|url= |journal=The Lancet Neurology|language=en|volume=20|issue=1|pages=25|doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(20)30444-0|pmc=7116571|pmid=33340480}}</ref>
