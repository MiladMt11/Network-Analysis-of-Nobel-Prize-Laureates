==Biography==
Martinus Justinus Godefriedus Veltman was born in [[Waalwijk]], Netherlands, on 27 June 1931. His father was the head of the local primary school. Three of his father's siblings were primary school teachers. His mother's father was a contractor and also ran a café. He was the fourth child in a family with six children. He started studying mathematics and physics at [[Utrecht University]] in 1948.<ref name="Nobel-bio">{{Nobelprize}}</ref> 

As a youth he had a great interest in radio electronics, which was a difficult hobby to work on because the occupying German army had confiscated most of the available radio equipment.<ref name="Nobel-bio" />

In 1955, he became an assistant to Prof. Michels of the Van Der Waals laboratory in [[Amsterdam]]. Michels was an experimental physicist, working in high pressure physics. His primary task was the upkeep of a large library collection and occasional lecture preparations for Michels. 

His research career advanced when he moved to [[Utrecht]] to work under [[Léon Van Hove]] in 1955. He received his [[Master of Science|MSc]] degree in 1956, after which he was drafted into military service for two years, returning in February 1959. Van Hove then hired him as a doctoral researcher. He obtained his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in theoretical physics in 1963 and became professor at Utrecht University in 1966.<ref name="Nobel-bio" />

In 1960, Van Hove became director of the theory division at [[CERN]] in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, the European High Energy laboratory. Veltman followed him there in 1961. Meanwhile, in 1960, he married his wife Anneke, who gave birth to their daughter Hélène in the Netherlands, before moving to Geneva to live with Martinus. Hélène followed in her father's footsteps and in due time completed her particle physics thesis with [[Mary Gaillard]] at [[UC Berkeley|Berkeley]], though she now works in the financial industry in [[London]].<ref name="Nobel-bio" />

In 1963/64, during an extended stay at [[SLAC]] he designed the computer program [[Schoonschip]] for symbolic manipulation of mathematical equations, which is now considered the very first [[computer algebra system]].

Veltman was closely involved in the 1963 CERN neutrino experiment, analyzing images as they were generated by the detectors. When no spectacular events came out, enthusiasm waned, and after a while Veltman and Bernardini were the only ones analyzing the images. As a result, Veltman became the spokesman for the group at the Brookhaven Conference in 1963.<ref name="Nobel-bio" />

In 1971, [[Gerardus 't Hooft]], who was completing his PhD under the supervision of Veltman, [[renormalization|renormalized]] [[Yang–Mills theory]]. They showed that if the symmetries of Yang–Mills theory were to be realized in the [[Spontaneous symmetry breaking|spontaneously broken]] mode, referred to as the [[Higgs mechanism]],  then Yang–Mills theory can be renormalized.<ref>{{cite journal | author=G.

In 1980, Veltman became member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/members/8030 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201125225944/https://www.knaw.nl/en/members/members/8030 |title=Martinus Veltman |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |archive-date=25 November 2020}}</ref> In 1981, Veltman left [[Utrecht University]] for the [[University of Michigan-Ann Arbor]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uu.nl/en/research/prizes-and-distinctions/nobel-prize-winners|title=Nobel Prize winners - Organisation - Universiteit Utrecht|website=www.uu.nl}}</ref> from where he retired in 1996.

Eventually, he shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1999 with 't Hooft, "for elucidating the quantum structure of [[electroweak]] interactions in physics".<ref name="Nobel-bio" /> Veltman and 't Hooft joined in the celebrations at [[Utrecht University]] when the prize was awarded.

In 2003, Veltman published a book about particle physics for a broad audience, entitled ''Facts and Mysteries in Elementary Particle Physics''.

On 4 January 2021, Veltman died in his home in [[Bilthoven]], the Netherlands.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Nobel prize winner Martinus Veltman passed away - News - Universiteit Utrecht|url=https://www.uu.nl/en/news/nobel-prize-winner-martinus-veltman-passed-away|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210106131011/https://www.uu.nl/en/news/nobel-prize-winner-martinus-veltman-passed-away|date=2021-01-06|archive-date=2021-01-06|website=www.uu.nl|language=en}}</ref>
