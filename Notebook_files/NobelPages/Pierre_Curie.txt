==Early life==
Born in Paris on 15 May 1859, Pierre Curie was the son of Eugène Curie (28 August 1827 – 25 February 1910), a doctor of French Catholic origin from [[Alsace]], and Sophie-Claire Curie (née Depouilly) (15 January 1832 – 27 September 1897). He was educated by his father and in his early teens showed a strong aptitude for mathematics and geometry. When he was 16, he earned his Bachelor of Science in mathematics.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Pierre Curie|url=https://biography.yourdictionary.com/pierre-curie|access-date=11 December 2020|website=biography.yourdictionary.com}}</ref>{{clarify|date=November 2017}} By the age of 18, he earned his license, the equivalent of a U.S. masters degree, in physical sciences from the Faculty of Sciences at the [[Sorbonne]], also known as the University of Paris.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Pierre Curie|url=https://www.atomicheritage.org/profile/pierre-curie|access-date=6 November 2020|website=Atomic Heritage Foundation|language=en|archive-date=11 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210211002719/https://www.atomicheritage.org/profile/pierre-curie|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Pierre Curie|url=https://history.aip.org/exhibits/curie/pierre.htm|access-date=11 December 2020|website=history.aip.org|archive-date=11 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210211002622/https://history.aip.org/exhibits/curie/pierre.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> He did not proceed immediately to a doctorate due to lack of money.

Before his famous doctoral studies on magnetism, he designed and perfected an extremely sensitive [[torsion balance]] for measuring magnetic coefficients. Variations on this equipment were commonly used by future workers in that area. Pierre Curie studied [[ferromagnetism]], [[paramagnetism]], and [[diamagnetism]] for his doctoral thesis, and discovered the effect of temperature on paramagnetism which is now known as [[Curie's law]]. The material constant in Curie's law is known as the [[Curie constant]]. He also discovered that ferromagnetic substances exhibited a [[critical temperature]] transition, above which the substances lost their ferromagnetic behavior. This is now known as the [[Curie temperature]]. The Curie temperature is used to study plate tectonics, treat hypothermia, measure caffeine, and to understand extraterrestrial magnetic fields.<ref name="auto">{{cite book

Introduce a [[gravitational field]], and there is a dissymmetry because of the direction of the field. Then the sand grains can 'self-sort' with the density increasing with depth. But this new arrangement, with the directional arrangement of sand grains, actually reflects the dissymmetry of the gravitational field that causes the separation.

Curie worked with [[Marie Curie|his wife]] in isolating [[polonium]] and [[radium]]. They were the first to use the term "[[radioactivity]]", and were pioneers in its study.

===Spiritualism===
In the late nineteenth century, Pierre Curie was investigating the mysteries of ordinary [[magnetism]] when he became aware of the [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]] experiments of other European scientists, such as [[Charles Richet]] and [[Camille Flammarion]]. Pierre Curie initially thought the systematic investigation into the paranormal could help with some unanswered questions about magnetism.<ref name=Hurwic>{{cite book|last1=Hurwic|first1=Anna|title=Pierre Curie, Translated by Lilananda Dasa and Joseph Cudnik|date=1995|publisher=Flammarion|location=Paris|isbn=9782082115629}}</ref>{{rp|65}} He wrote to his fiancée [[Marie Curie|Marie]]:  "I must admit that those [[Spiritualism|spiritual]] phenomena intensely interest me.

==Death==
Pierre Curie died in a street accident in Paris on 19 April 1906. Crossing the busy [[Rue Dauphine]] in the rain at the Quai de Conti, he slipped and fell under a heavy horse-drawn cart. One of the wheels ran over his head, fracturing his skull and killing him instantly.<ref name=obit>{{Citation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1906/04/20/archives/prof-curie-killed-in-a-paris-street-the-discoverer-of-radium-run.html |title=Prof. Curie killed in a Paris street |date=20 April 1906 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=25 July 2018 |archive-date=25 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180725215446/https://www.nytimes.com/1906/04/20/archives/prof-curie-killed-in-a-paris-street-the-discoverer-of-radium-run.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Statements made by his father and lab assistant imply that Curie's characteristic absent-minded preoccupation with his thoughts contributed to his death.<ref name=preoc>{{Citation |url=http://history.aip.org/history/exhibits/curie/trag1.htm |title=Marie Curie - Tragedy and Adjustment (1906-1910) |date=2000 |work=Marie Curie and the Science of Radioactivity |access-date=17 January 2017 |archive-date=11 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210211002646/https://history.aip.org/history/exhibits/curie/trag1.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

They experienced radiation sickness and Marie Curie died of [[aplastic anemia]] in 1934. Even now, all their papers from the 1890s, even her cookbooks, are too dangerous to touch.

In April 1995, Pierre and Marie Curie were moved from their original resting place, a family cemetery, and enshrined in the [[crypt]] of the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon in Paris]].
