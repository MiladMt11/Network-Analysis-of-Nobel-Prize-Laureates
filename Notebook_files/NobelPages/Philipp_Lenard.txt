'''Philipp Eduard Anton von Lenard''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfɪlɪp ˈleːnaʁt|-|De-Philipp Lenard.ogg}}; {{lang-hu|Lénárd Fülöp Eduárd Antal}}; 7 June 1862 – 20 May 1947) was a Hungarian-born German [[physicist]] and the winner of the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1905 for his work on [[cathode ray]]s and the discovery of many of their properties. One of his most important contributions was the experimental realization of the [[photoelectric effect]]. He discovered that the energy (speed) of the electrons ejected from a cathode depends only on the wavelength, and not the intensity, of the incident light.

Lenard was a nationalist and [[antisemitism|anti-Semite]]; as an active proponent of the [[Nazi ideology]], he supported [[Adolf Hitler]] in the 1920s and was an important role model for the "[[Deutsche Physik]]" movement during the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi period]]. Notably, he labeled [[Albert Einstein]]'s contributions to science as "[[Jew]]ish physics".

==Early life and work==
Philipp Lenard was born in [[Bratislava|Pressburg]] (''Pozsony'', today's Bratislava), on 7 June 1862 in the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. The Lenard family had originally come from [[Tyrol]] in the 17th century, while his mother's family originated from [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]], the parents were [[Carpathian Germans|German-speaking]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Pöss | first = Ondrej | editor = Myrtil Nagy | chapter = Karpatskí Nemci | title = Naše národnostné menšiny | publisher = Fórum inštitút pre výskum menšín | year = 2012 | location = Šamorín  | pages = 9–12 | isbn = 978-80-89249-57-2 }}</ref> His father, Philipp von Lenardis (1812–1896), was a wine-merchant in Pressburg.

In Heidelberg, he studied under the illustrious [[Robert Bunsen]], interrupted by one semester in Berlin with [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], and he obtained a [[doctorate|doctoral]] degree in 1886.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mek.iif.hu/porta/szint/tarsad/tudtan/nobel/html/lenard/lenard.htm |title=Lénárd Fülöp |publisher=Mek.iif.hu |access-date=2013-07-13}}</ref> In 1887 he worked again in Budapest under [[Loránd Eötvös]] as a demonstrator.<ref name="Lenard"/> After posts at Aachen, Bonn, Breslau, Heidelberg (1896–1898), and Kiel (1898–1907), he returned finally to the [[University of Heidelberg]] in 1907 as the head of the Philipp Lenard Institute. In 1905, Lenard became a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]], and in 1907, of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]].<ref name="Lenard"/>

His early work included studies of [[phosphorescence]] and [[luminescence]] and the conductivity of flames.

==Contributions to physics==
===Photoelectric investigations===
[[File:The dynamid atomic model, by Philipp Lenard, 1903.gif|thumb|The dynamid atomic model, by Philipp Lenard, 1903]]
As a physicist, Lenard's major contributions were in the study of [[cathode rays]], which he began in 1888. Prior to his work, cathode rays were produced in primitive, partially evacuated glass tubes that had metallic electrodes in them, across which a high voltage could be placed. Cathode rays were difficult to study using this arrangement, because they were inside sealed glass tubes, difficult to access, and because the rays were in the presence of air molecules. Lenard overcame these problems by devising a method of making small metallic windows in the glass that were thick enough to be able to withstand the pressure differences, but thin enough to allow passage of the rays. Having made a window for the rays, he could pass them out into the laboratory, or, alternatively, into another chamber that was completely evacuated. These windows have come to be known as ''Lenard windows''. He was able to conveniently detect the rays and measure their intensity by means of paper sheets coated with phosphorescent materials.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Philipp Lenard | title=Ueber Kathodenstrahlen in Gasen von atmosphärischem Druck und im äussersten Vacuum | journal=Annalen der Physik | volume=287 | issue=2 | pages=225–267 | year=1894  | doi=10.1002/andp.18942870202|bibcode = 1894AnP...287..225L | url=https://zenodo.org/record/1423886 }}</ref>

Lenard observed that the absorption of cathode rays was, to first order, proportional to the density of the material they were made to pass through. This appeared to contradict the idea that they were some sort of electromagnetic radiation. He also showed that the rays could pass through some inches of air of a normal density, and appeared to be scattered by it, implying that they must be particles that were even smaller than the molecules in air. He confirmed some of [[J. J. Thomson]]'s work, which eventually arrived at the understanding that cathode rays were streams of negatively charged energetic particles. He called them [[electron|quanta of electricity]] or for short [[quantum|quanta]], after [[Helmholtz]], while Thomson proposed the name [[Corpuscle (disambiguation)|corpuscles]], but eventually [[electron]]s became the everyday term.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1905/lenard-lecture.pdf |title=Lenard's Nobel lecture (1906) |access-date=2010-08-25}}</ref> In conjunction with his and other earlier experiments on the absorption of the rays in metals, the general realization that electrons were constituent parts of the atom enabled Lenard to claim correctly that for the most part atoms consist of empty space. He proposed that every atom consists of empty space and electrically neutral corpuscules called "dynamids", each consisting of an electron and an equal positive charge.

As a result of his [[Crookes tube]] investigations, he showed that the rays produced by irradiating metals in a vacuum with ultraviolet light were similar in many respects to cathode rays. His most important observations were that the energy of the rays was independent of the light intensity, but was greater for shorter wavelengths of light.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Philipp Lenard and the Photoelectric Effect, 1889-1911 |first=Bruce R. |last=Wheaton |journal=Historical Studies in the Physical Sciences |volume=9 |year=1978 |pages=299–322 |doi=10.2307/27757381 |jstor=27757381}}</ref>

These latter observations were [[Annus Mirabilis papers#Photoelectric effect|explained]] by [[Albert Einstein]] as a quantum effect. This theory predicted that the plot of the cathode ray energy versus the frequency would be a straight line with a slope equal to Planck's constant, ''h''. This was shown to be the case some years later. The photo-electric quantum theory was the work cited when Einstein was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921. Suspicious of the general adulation of Einstein, Lenard became a prominent skeptic of relativity and of Einstein's theories generally; he did not, however, dispute Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect. Lenard grew extremely resentful of the credit accorded to [[Wilhelm Röntgen]], who received the first Nobel Prize in physics in 1901, for the discovery of the X-ray,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/when-science-gets-ugly-the-story-of-philipp-lenard-and-albert-einstein-43165|title=When science gets ugly – the story of Philipp Lenard and Albert Einstein |access-date=2018-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.space.com/36767-natgeo-genius-science-political.html|title=Science Gets Political, Einstein Gets Fired in Nat Geo's 'Genius'}}</ref> despite the fact that Röntgen was German and a non-Jew. Lenard wrote that he, not Roentgen, was the “mother of the X-rays,” since he had invented the apparatus used to produce them. Lenard likened Röntgen’s role to that of a “midwife” who merely assists with the birth.

Lenard received the 1905 [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in recognition of this work.

===Meteorological contributions<!--'Spray electrification' and 'Waterfall effect' redirect here-->===
Lenard was the first person to study what has been termed the ''Lenard effect'' in 1892. This is the separation of electric charges accompanying the [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] breakup of water drops. It is also known as '''spray electrification'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> or the '''waterfall effect'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=lenard-effect1 |title=American Meteorological Society Glossary |publisher=Amsglossary.allenpress.com |date=2013-06-25 |access-date=2013-07-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205021120/http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=lenard-effect1 |archive-date=2012-02-05 }}</ref>

He conducted studies on the size and shape distributions of raindrops and constructed a novel [[wind tunnel]] in which water droplets of various sizes could be held stationary for a few seconds. He was the first to recognize that large raindrops are not tear-shaped, but are rather shaped something like a hamburger bun.<ref>{{cite web

==''Deutsche Physik''==
{{main|Deutsche Physik}}
Lenard is remembered today as a strong [[German nationalist]] who despised "English physics", which he considered to have stolen its ideas from Germany.<ref name="Rydell2017">{{cite book|author=Anders Rydell|title=The Book Thieves: The Nazi Looting of Europe's Libraries and the Race to Return a Literary Inheritance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yMQiDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA86|date=7 February 2017|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-7352-2124-6|pages=86–}}</ref><ref name="Kojevnikov2011">{{cite book|author=Alexei Kojevnikov|title=Weimar Culture and Quantum Mechanics: Selected Papers by Paul Forman and Contemporary Perspectives on the Forman Thesis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1FEsrL8aQVoC&pg=PA33|year=2011|publisher=World Scientific|isbn=978-981-4293-12-9|pages=33–|bibcode=2011wcqm.book.....K|doi=10.1142/7581}}</ref><ref name="Steinhaus2016">{{cite book|author=Hugo Steinhaus|title=Mathematician for All Seasons: Recollections and Notes, Vol. 2 (1945–1968)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IeOKCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA105|date=8 February 2016|publisher=Birkhäuser|isbn=978-3-319-23102-0|pages=105–}}</ref> During the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime, he was the outspoken proponent of the idea that Germany should rely on "[[Deutsche Physik]]" and ignore what he considered the fallacious and deliberately misleading ideas of "Jewish physics", by which he meant chiefly the theories of Albert Einstein, including "the Jewish fraud" of [[theory of relativity|relativity]] (see also [[criticism of the theory of relativity]]).<ref>[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-2-pro-nazi-nobelists-attacked-einstein-s-jewish-science-excerpt1/ "How 2 Pro-Nazi Nobelists Attacked Einstein’s "Jewish Science"].

Some measure of Lenard's views on certain scientists may be deduced through examination of Lenard's book, ''Great Men in Science, A History of Scientific Progress'', first published in English in 1933. The book was translated into English by [[H. Stafford Hatfield]] with an introduction by [[Edward Andrade]] of [[University College London]] (ironically, a [[Sephardic Jew]] himself) and was widely read in schools and universities after the Second World War. The individual scientists selected for inclusion by Lenard do not include Einstein or Curie, nor any other twentieth century scientist.  Andrade noted that "A strong individuality like that of the writer of this book is bound to assert strongly individual judgements".<ref>{{cite book | last=Lenard | first=Philipp | title=Great Men of Science | url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.203547 | location=London | publisher=G. Bell and sons | year=1933 | oclc=1156317 |page=xi}}</ref> The publisher included what now appears to be a remarkable understatement on page xix of the 1954 English edition: "While Professor Lenard's studies of the men of science who preceded him showed not only profound knowledge but also admirable balance, when it came to men of his own time he was apt to let his own strong views on contemporary matters sway his judgment. In his lifetime he would not consent to certain modifications that were proposed in the last study of the series".

==Later life==
Lenard retired from Heidelberg University as professor of [[theoretical physics]] in 1931. He achieved [[emeritus]] status there, but he was expelled from his post by [[Allied-occupied Germany|Allied occupation]] forces in 1945 when he was 83. The [[Helmholtz-Gymnasium Heidelberg]] had been named the Philipp Lenard Schule from 1927 until 1945. As part of the elimination of Nazi street names and monuments it was renamed in September 1945 by order of the [[Office of Military Government, United States|military government]].<ref name="HGH1">Geierhaas, Theo. [http://www.helmholtz-heidelberg.de/gymnasium/unser-helmholtz/schulgeschichte/ "Schulgeschichte"]. Helmholtz-Gymnasium Heidelberg.
