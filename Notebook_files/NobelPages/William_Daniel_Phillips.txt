'''William Daniel Phillips''' (born November 5, 1948) is an American [[physicist]]. He shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], in 1997, with [[Steven Chu]] and [[Claude Cohen-Tannoudji]].

==Biography==
Phillips was born to William Cornelius Phillips of Juniata, Pennsylvania and Mary Catherine Savino of [[Ripacandida]], [[Italy]]. He is of [[Italian people|Italian]] descent on his mother's side and of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] descent on his father's side.<ref>{{Nobelprize|accessdate=29 April 2020}}</ref> His parents moved to [[Camp Hill, Pennsylvania|Camp Hill]] (near [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]]) in 1959, where he attended [[Camp Hill High School|high school]] and graduated valedictorian of his class in 1966. He graduated from [[Juniata College]] in 1970 [[summa cum laude]]. After that he received his physics doctorate from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].  In 1978 he joined [[NIST]].

In 1996, he received the [[Albert A. Michelson Medal]] from [[The Franklin Institute]].<ref name="MichelsonMedal_Laureates">{{cite web |url=http://www.fi.edu/winners/show_results.faw?gs=&ln=&fn=&keyword=&subject=&award=MICH+&sy=1967&ey=1997&name=Submit |title=Franklin Laureate Database – Albert A.

Phillips' doctoral thesis concerned the magnetic moment of the proton in H<sub>2</sub>O. He later did some work with [[Bose–Einstein condensate]]s. In 1997 he won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] together with [[Claude Cohen-Tannoudji]] and [[Steven Chu]] for his contributions to [[laser cooling]], a technique to slow the movement of gaseous atoms in order to better study them, at the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], and especially for his invention of the [[Zeeman slower]].

Phillips is also a professor of physics, which is part of the [[University of Maryland College of Computer, Mathematical, and Natural Sciences]] at [[University of Maryland, College Park]].

Phillips is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President [[George W. Bush]] in May 2008, urging him to "reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill" by requesting additional emergency funding for the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]’s [[Office of Science]], the [[National Science Foundation]], and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=A Letter from America's Physics Nobel Laureates|url=https://fire.pppl.gov/nobel_bush_fy08_050808.pdf}}</ref>

He was one of the 35 Nobel laureates who signed a letter urging President Obama to provide a stable $15 billion per year support for clean energy research, technology and demonstration.<ref>[https://fas.org/press/_docs/Nobelist%20Letter%20to%20White%20House%20-%2007162009.pdf Open Letter to President Obama] (PDF). {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111201181805/https://fas.org/press/_docs/Nobelist%20Letter%20to%20White%20House%20-%2007162009.pdf|date=December 1, 2011}}.

He is one of three well-known scientists and [[Methodist]] laity who have involved themselves in the [[religion and science]] dialogue. The other two scientists and fellow Methodists are chemist [[Charles Coulson]] and 1981 Nobel laureate [[Arthur Leonard Schawlow]].{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In Oct 2010 Phillips participated in the [[USA Science and Engineering Festival]]'s lunch with a laureate program where middle and high school students got to engage in an informal conversation with a Nobel Prize-winning scientist over a brown-bag lunch.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usasciencefestival.org/2010festival/schoolprograms/lunchwithalaureate |title=Lunch with a Laureate |access-date=2010-12-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620180756/http://www.usasciencefestival.org/2010festival/schoolprograms/lunchwithalaureate |archive-date=June 20, 2010 }}. usasciencefestival.org (2010)</ref> Phillips is also a member of the USA Science and Engineering Festival's Advisory Board.<ref>[http://www.usasciencefestival.org/about/advisors Advisors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421005310/http://www.usasciencefestival.org/about/advisors/ |date=2010-04-21 }}.

==Personal life==
Phillips married Jane Van Wynen shortly before he went to MIT. Neither had been regular churchgoers early in their marriage. However, in 1979, they joined the Fairhaven [[United Methodist Church]] in [[Gaithersburg, Maryland]] because they appreciated its diversity. He is a founding member of the [[International Society for Science and Religion]]. He and his wife have two daughters; Caitlin Phillips (b 1979) who founded [http://www.rebound-designs.com/ Rebound Designs], and Christine Phillips (b 1981) who works in Science Communication.

During a seminar at the University of Maryland Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry titled ''Coherent Atoms in [[Optical lattice|Optical Lattices]]'' Phillips stated, "[[Rubidium]] is God's gift to Bose–Einstein condensates."
