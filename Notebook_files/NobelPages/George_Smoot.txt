{{Cosmology|scientists}}
'''George Fitzgerald Smoot III''' (born February 20, 1945) is an [[United States|American]] [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]], [[cosmology|cosmologist]], Nobel laureate, and one of two contestants to win the {{usd}}1 million prize on ''[[Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader? (U.S. game show)|Are You Smarter than a 5th Grader?]]''. He won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 2006 for his work on the [[Cosmic Background Explorer]] with [[John C. Mather]] that led to the "discovery of the [[black body]] form and [[anisotropy]] of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]".

This work helped further the [[Big Bang]] theory of the universe using the [[Cosmic Background Explorer]] (COBE) satellite.<ref>Horgan, J. (1992) ''Profile: George F. Smoot &ndash; COBE's Cosmic Cartographer'', [[Scientific American]] '''267'''(1), 34-41.</ref> According to the Nobel Prize committee, "the COBE project can also be regarded as the starting point for [[cosmology]] as a precision science."<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2006/info.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2006 |publisher=The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences |format=.PDF |date=3 October 2006 |access-date=2006-10-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815040431/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2006/info.html |archive-date=2010-08-15 }}</ref> Smoot donated his share of the Nobel Prize money, less travel costs, to a charitable foundation.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://ebcf.org/press/07/Smoot_AP_3-07.pdf | title=Berkeley Nobel laureates donate prize money to charity | publisher=[[Associated Press]] | date=22 March 2007 | access-date=31 March 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726012539/http://www.ebcf.org/press/07/Smoot_AP_3-07.pdf | archive-date=26 July 2011 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

Smoot has been at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and the [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] since 1970. He is Chair of the Endowment Fund "Physics of the Universe" of Paris Center for Cosmological Physics. Apart from being elected a member of the US National Academy of Sciences and a Fellow of the American Physical Society, Smoot has been honored by several universities worldwide with doctorates or professorships. He was also the recipient of Gruber Prize in Cosmology (2006), Daniel Chalonge Medal from the International School of Astrophysics (2006), Einstein Medal from Albert Einstein Society (2003), Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award from the US Department of Energy (1995), and the Exceptional Scientific Achievement Medal from NASA (1991). He is a member of the Advisory Board of the journal ''Universe''.

Smoot is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President [[George W. Bush]] in May of 2008, urging him to "reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill" by requesting additional emergency funding for the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]’s [[Office of Science]], the [[National Science Foundation]], and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=A Letter from America's Physics Nobel Laureates|url=https://fire.pppl.gov/nobel_bush_fy08_050808.pdf}}</ref>

==Early life==
Smoot was born in [[Yukon, Florida]]. His maternal grandfather was [[Johnson T. Crawford|Johnson Tal Crawford]]. He graduated from [[Upper Arlington High School (Ohio)|Upper Arlington High School]] in [[Upper Arlington, Ohio]], in 1962.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Gregory L|title=Nobel Prize winner returns home|url=http://aether.lbl.gov/PDFs/UANewsGeorgeSmoot041807.pdf|publisher=Upper Arlington News|access-date=30 November 2016|date=18 April 2007}}</ref> He studied [[mathematics]] before switching to physics at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], where he obtained dual [[bachelor's degree]]s in [[mathematics]] and physics in 1966 and a [[Ph.D.]] in [[particle physics]] in 1970.<ref name="thesis-smoot-1971">{{cite thesis |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/302620738/ |title=Charge exchange of positive Kaon on platinum at three GeV/C |date=1971 |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] |degree=Ph.D. |last=Smoot |first=George Fitzgerald, III |via=[[ProQuest]] |url-access=subscription  |oclc=25256702}}</ref><ref>{{cite press release | title=Nobelists' work supports big-bang theory | publisher=[[MIT]] Press Office | date=3 October 2006 | url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2006/smoot.html | access-date=2006-10-03 }}</ref> (It is Smoot's cousin, [[Oliver R. Smoot]], who was the MIT student who was used as the unit of measure known as the ''[[smoot]]''.)

==Initial research==
George Smoot switched to cosmology and began work at Berkeley, collaborating with [[Luis Walter Alvarez]] on the High Altitude Particle Physics Experiment, a [[stratosphere|stratospheric]] [[weather balloon]] designed to detect [[antimatter]] in Earth's upper atmosphere, the presence of which was predicted by the now discredited [[steady state theory]] of cosmology.

He then took up an interest in [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMB), previously discovered by [[Arno Allan Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson]] in 1964. There were, at that time, several open questions about this topic, relating directly to fundamental questions about the structure of the [[universe]]. Certain models predicted the universe as a whole was rotating, which would have an effect on the CMB: its [[temperature]] would depend on the direction of observation. With the help of Alvarez and [[Richard A. Muller]], Smoot developed a differential [[radiometer]] which measured the difference in temperature of the CMB between two directions 60 degrees apart. The instrument, which was mounted on a [[Lockheed U-2]] plane, made it possible to determine that the overall rotation of the universe was zero, which was within the limits of accuracy of the instrument. It did, however, detect a variation in the temperature of the CMB of a different sort. That the CMB appears to be at a higher temperature on one side of the sky than on the opposite side, referred to as a dipole pattern, has been explained as a [[Doppler effect]] of the Earth's motion relative to the area of CMB emission, which is called the [[last scattering surface]]. Such a Doppler effect arises because the [[Sun]], and in fact the [[Milky Way]] as a whole, is not stationary, but rather is moving at nearly 600&nbsp;km/s with respect to the last scattering surface. This is probably due to the [[gravity|gravitational attraction]] between our galaxy and a concentration of mass like the [[Great Attractor]].

==COBE==
[[File:COBE cmb fluctuations.png|thumb|300px|Map of the CMB fluctuations found by COBE.]]
At that time, the CMB appeared to be perfectly uniform excluding the distortion caused by the Doppler effect as mentioned above. This result contradicted observations of the universe, with various structures such as [[galaxy|galaxies]] and [[galaxy cluster]]s indicating that the universe was relatively [[heterogeneous]] on a small scale. However, these structures formed slowly. Thus, if the universe is heterogeneous today, it would have been heterogeneous at the time of the emission of the CMB as well, and observable today through weak variations in the temperature of the CMB. It was the detection of these anisotropies that Smoot was working on in the late 1970s. He then proposed to [[NASA]] a project involving a [[satellite]] equipped with a detector that was similar to the one mounted on the U-2 but was more sensitive and not influenced by [[air pollution]]. The proposal was accepted and incorporated as one of the instruments of the satellite [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]], which cost $160 million. COBE was launched on November 18, 1989, after a delay owing to the destruction of the [[Space Shuttle Challenger]]. After more than two years of observation and analysis, the COBE research team announced on 23 April 1992 that the satellite had detected tiny fluctuations in the CMB, a breakthrough in the study of the early universe.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Smoot | first=G.F. |display-authors=etal  |date=September 1992 | title=Structure in the COBE differential microwave radiometer first-year maps | journal=Astrophysical Journal | volume=396 | issue=1 | pages=L1–L5 | doi=10.1086/186504 | bibcode=1992ApJ...396L...1S}}</ref> The observations were "evidence for the birth of the universe" and led Smoot to say regarding the importance of his discovery that "if you're religious, it's like looking at God."<ref>{{cite news | agency=Associated Press | title=U.S. Scientists Find a 'Holy Grail': Ripples at Edge of the Universe | pages=1 | work=[[International Herald Tribune]] | date=April 24, 1992}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | author=Thomas H.

[[File:George Smoot.jpg|right|thumb|Smoot celebrating his Nobel Prize at [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]], 3 October 2006]]
The success of [[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]] was the outcome of extensive teamwork involving more than 1,000 researchers, engineers and other participants. John Mather coordinated the entire process and also had primary responsibility for the experiment that revealed the blackbody form of the CMB measured by COBE. Smoot had the main responsibility of measuring the small variations in the temperature of the radiation.<ref>{{cite press release | title=Pictures of a Newborn Universe | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2006/press.html | publisher=Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences | date=3 October 2006 | access-date=2007-09-05}}</ref>

Smoot collaborated with ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' journalist Keay Davidson to write the general-audience book ''[[Wrinkles in Time]]'', that chronicled his team's efforts.<ref>{{cite book | last=Smoot | first=George | author2=Davidson, Keay | title=Wrinkles in Time | location=New York | publisher=W.

Smoot eventually apologized for not following the agreed publicity plan and Mather said tensions eventually eased. Mather acknowledged that Smoot had "brought COBE worldwide publicity" the project might not normally have received.<ref>{{cite news | author=Lynn Yarris | title=After the Phone Call | url=http://www.lbl.gov/Science-Articles/Archive/sabl/2006/Oct/4.html | work=Science@Berkeley Lab | date=26 October 2006 | access-date=2007-09-05}}</ref>

==Other projects==
After COBE, Smoot took part in another experiment involving a stratospheric balloon, [[Millimeter Anisotropy eXperiment IMaging Array]], which had improved angular resolution compared to COBE, and refined the measurements of the anisotropies of the CMB. Smoot has continued CMB observations and analysis and was a collaborator on the third generation CMB anisotropy observatory [[Planck satellite]]. He is also a collaborator of the design of the [[Supernova/Acceleration Probe]], a satellite which is proposed to measure the properties of [[dark energy]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Supernova/Acceleration Probe (SNAP) | url=http://snap.lbl.gov | publisher=[[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] | access-date=2007-09-05}}</ref> He has also assisted in analyzing data from the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] in connection with measuring [[Infrared astronomy|far infrared background radiation]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Spitzer Cosmic Far-IR Background Project | url=http://www-astro.lbl.gov/~bruce/spitzerlblpage | publisher=Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory | access-date=2007-09-05}}</ref> Smoot also was a leader in a group that launched the [[Mikhailo Lomonosov (satellite)|Mikhailo Lomonosov]] April 28, 2016.{{cn|date=April 2019}}

Smoot is credited by [[Mickey Hart]] for inspiring the album ''[[Mysterium Tremendum]]'', which is based, in part on "sounds" that can be extracted from the background signature of the Big Bang.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Into the Heart of Music: Recording the Mickey Hart Band's "Mysterium Tremendum" {{!}} Grateful Dead|url = http://www.dead.net/features/blair-jackson/heart-music-recording-mickey-hart-band-s-mysterium-tremendum|website = www.dead.net|access-date = 2016-01-02}}</ref>

In November 2020, joined [[Premier Dead Sea|Dead Sea Premier]] as head of research for their NUNA advanced technology anti-aging medical device development.

In April 2021, George Smoot joined the [[Xiaomi]] eco-system company Viomi as chief scientist for their AI-development.

==Media appearances==
Smoot had a [[cameo appearance]] as himself in "[[The Terminator Decoupling]]" episode of ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]''.<ref>{{Cite episode | title = The Terminator Decoupling | episode-link = The Terminator Decoupling | series = [[The Big Bang Theory]] | network = CBS | date = 9 March 2009 | season = 2 | number = 17 | minutes = 20}}</ref> He contacted the show as a fan of their often physics-based plots and was incorporated into an episode featuring him lecturing at a fictional physics symposium.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Big Bang Theory Videos | url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/big_bang_theory/video/ | publisher=CBS | access-date=2012-08-04}}</ref> He is also credited by the producer of the show with providing a joke told by Penny in the episode "[[The Dead Hooker Juxtaposition]]".<ref>{{cite web|last=Lorre|first=Chuck|title=Big Bang Theory Season 2 Episode 19 Vanity Card|url=http://www.chucklorre.com/index-bbt.php?p=247|access-date=2014-01-17}}</ref>
In April 2019 he also appeared in the episode The Laureate Accumulation.

On September 18, 2009, Smoot appeared on an episode of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] television show ''[[Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?]]'' During filming, he reached the final question, "What U.S. state is home to [[Acadia National Park]]?", to which he gave the  correct answer "[[Maine]]", becoming the second person to win the one-million-dollar prize.<ref>{{cite web|title=Are You Smarter Than 5th Grader?
