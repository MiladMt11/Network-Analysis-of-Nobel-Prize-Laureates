==Early life==
Mansfield was born in [[Lambeth]], [[London]] on 9 October 1933, to Sidney George (b. 1904, d. 1966) and Lillian Rose Mansfield (b. 1905, d. 1984; née Turner). Mansfield is the youngest of three sons, Conrad (b. 1925) and Sidney (b. 1927).<ref name="nobel_autobiography"/>

Mansfield grew up in [[Camberwell]]. During [[World War II]] he was [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II|evacuated]] from London, initially to [[Sevenoaks]] and then twice to [[Torquay]], Devon, where he was able to stay with the same family on both occasions.<ref name=nobel_autobiography/> On returning to London after the war he was told by a school master to take the [[Eleven plus exam|11+]] exam. Having never heard of the exam before, and having no time to prepare, Mansfield failed to gain a place at the local Grammar school. His mark was, however, high enough for him to go to a Central School in [[Peckham]]. At the age of 15 he was told by a careers teacher that science wasn't for him. He left school shortly afterwards to work as a printer's assistant.

At the age of 18, having developed an interest in rocketry, Mansfield took up a job with the Rocket Propulsion Department of the [[Ministry of Supply]] in [[Westcott, Buckinghamshire]]. Eighteen months later he was called up for [[Conscription in the United Kingdom|National Service]].

==Education==
After serving in the army for two years, Mansfield returned to Westcott and started studying for A-levels at night school. Two years later he was admitted to study physics at [[Queen Mary College, University of London]].

Mansfield graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] from Queen Mary's in 1959. His final-year project, supervised by Jack Powles, was to construct a portable, transistor-based spectrometer to measure the [[Earth's field NMR|Earth's magnetic field]]. Towards the end of this project Powles offered Mansfield a position in his NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) research group. Powles' interest was in studying molecular motion, mainly liquids. Mansfield's project was to build a pulsed NMR spectrometer to study solid polymer systems. He received his PhD in 1962; his thesis was titled ''Proton magnetic resonance relaxation in solids by transient methods''.<ref name=phd_thesis />

==Career==
Following his PhD, Mansfield was invited to [[postdoctoral research]] with [[Charles Pence Slichter|Charlie Slichter]] at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]], where he carried out an NMR study of doped metals.

In 1964 he returned to England to take up a place as a [[lecturer]] at Nottingham University where he could continue his studies in multiple-pulse NMR. He was successively appointed Senior Lecturer in 1968 and Reader in 1970. During this period his team developed the MRI equipment with the help of grants from the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]]. It was not until the 1970s with [[Paul Lauterbur]]'s and Mansfield's developments that NMR could be used to produce images of the body. In 1979 Mansfield was appointed Professor of the Department of Physics until his retirement in 1994.

Mansfield is credited with inventing 'slice selection' for MRI - i.e. the method by which a localised axial slice of a subject can be selectively imaged, rather than the entire subject<ref>{{cite web |title=Slice selection |url=https://www.radiologycafe.com/frcr-physics-notes/mr-imaging/slice-selection/ |website=Radiology Cafe |access-date=15 October 2021}}</ref> - and understanding how the radio signals from MRI can be mathematically analysed, making interpretation of the signals into a useful image a possibility. He is also credited with discovering how fast imaging could be possible by developing the MRI protocol called [[echo-planar imaging]]. Echo-planar imaging allows [[T2*-weighted imaging|T2* weighted images]] to be collected many times faster than previously possible. It also has made [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) feasible.

Whilst working at Nottingham University, Mansfield tested the first full body prototype, installed just before Christmas, 1978. Mansfield was so keen, that he volunteered to test it himself and produced the first scan of a live patient. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morris|first=P.
