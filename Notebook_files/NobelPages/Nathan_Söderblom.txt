==Biography==
Söderblom was born in the village of Trönö in [[Söderhamn Municipality]], [[Gävleborg County]]. His father was a parish priest. He enrolled at [[Uppsala University]] in 1883. Although not initially convinced what he wanted to study, he eventually decided to follow in his father's footsteps. On returning from a journey to the U.S., he was ordained priest in 1893. During the years 1892 and 1893, Söderblom was first vice president and then president of the [[Uppsala Student Union]].<ref name="sok"/>

From 1894 until 1901, he held a ministry at the Swedish Embassy in [[Paris]], where his congregation included both [[Alfred Nobel]] (1833–1896) and [[August Strindberg]] (1849–1912). In 1897, he conducted the memorial service following the death of Alfred Nobel. From 1901 to 1914, Söderblom held a chair in the School of Theology at [[Uppsala University]] and from 1912 to 1914 was also a professor of [[Religious studies]] at [[Leipzig University]]. In 1914, he was elected as [[Archbishop of Uppsala]], the head of the [[Church of Sweden|Lutheran church in Sweden]]. During the [[First World War]], he called on all Christian leaders to work for peace and justice while working to alleviate the conditions of prisoners of war and refugees.<ref>{{cite web|url=  https://www.giffordlectures.org/lecturers/nathan-s%C3%B6derblom|title = Nathan Söderblom|website= The Giffordlectures 
|access-date=July 1, 2020}}</ref>

He believed that church unity had the specific purpose of presenting the gospel to the world and that the messages of Jesus were relevant to social life. His leadership of the Christian "[[Life and Work (conference)|Life and Work]]" movement in the 1920s has led him to be recognised as one of the principal founders of the [[ecumenism|ecumenical movement]]. He had begun the movement toward intercommunion between the [[Church of Sweden]] and the [[Church of England]] and was a close associate of the English ecumenist [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]] (1883–1958), Dean of Canterbury, Bishop of Chichester. He was instrumental in chairing the [[World Conference of Life and Work]] in Stockholm, in 1925. In 1930 he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].<ref name="sok"/><ref>{{cite web|url= https://peaceprizelaureates.nobelpeacecenter.org/en/laureate/1930-nathan-soederblom |title = Nathan Söderblom 1930|website=Nobel Peace Center
