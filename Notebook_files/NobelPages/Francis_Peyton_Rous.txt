==Education and early life==
Rous was born in [[Woodlawn, Baltimore County, Maryland|Woodlawn, Maryland]] in 1879 and received his B.A. and M.D. from [[Johns Hopkins University]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Peyton Rous – Biography|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1966/rous.html|work=Nobelprize.org|access-date=6 June 2011}}</ref>

==Career and research==
Rous was involved in the discovery of the role of [[virus]]es in the transmission of certain types of [[cancer]]. On October 13, 1966, he was awarded a [[Nobel Prize]] [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|in Physiology or Medicine]] for his work.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

In 1911, as a pathologist, he made his seminal observation that a malignant tumor (specifically, a sarcoma) growing on a domestic chicken could be transferred to another fowl simply by exposing the healthy bird to a cell-free filtrate.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Peyton |last=Rous |title=A Transmissible Avian Neoplasm (Sarcoma of the Common Fowl) |journal=Journal of Experimental Medicine |volume=12 |issue=5 |year=1910 |pages=696–705 |doi=10.1084/jem.12.5.696 |pmid=19867354 |pmc=2124810 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Peyton |last=Rous |title=A Sarcoma of the Fowl Transmissible by an Agent Separable from the Tumor Cells |journal=Journal of Experimental Medicine |volume=13 |issue=4 |year=1911 |pages=397–411 |doi=10.1084/jem.13.4.397 |pmc=2124874 |pmid=19867421}}</ref>  This finding, that cancer could be transmitted by a virus (now known as the [[Rous sarcoma virus]], a retrovirus), was widely discredited by most of the field's experts at that time.  Since he was a relative newcomer, it was several years before anyone even tried to replicate his prescient results.  However, some influential researchers were impressed enough to nominate him to the Nobel Committee as early as 1926 (and in many subsequent years). Rous finally received the award 40 years later at the age of 87; he remains the oldest recipient of the Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology.<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/facts/facts-on-the-nobel-prize-in-physiology-or-medicine/ Rous as oldest recipient of the Nobel Prize for Medicine or Physiology]</ref>

==Awards and honors==
In addition to the Nobel Prize, Peyton Rous was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1940|Foreign Member of the Royal Society (ForMemRS) in 1940]],<ref name=formemrs/> and he won the [[Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research]] in 1958 and the [[National Medal of Science]] in 1965.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

==Personal life==
In his later life he wrote biographies of [[Simon Flexner]]<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Rous | first1 = P. | author-link = Francis Peyton Rous| title = Simon Flexner. 1863-1946 | doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1949.0006 | journal = [[Obituary Notices of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 6 | issue = 18 | pages = 408–426 | year = 1949 | s2cid = 159733258 }}</ref> and [[Karl Landsteiner]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Rous | first1 = P.| author-link = Francis Peyton Rous| title = Karl Landsteiner. 1868-1943 | doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1947.0002 | journal = [[Obituary Notices of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 5 | issue = 15 | pages = 294–324| year = 1947 | s2cid = 161789667}}</ref>
