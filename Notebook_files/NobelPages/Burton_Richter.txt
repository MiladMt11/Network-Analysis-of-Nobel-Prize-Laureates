As a professor at Stanford, Richter designed the [[SPEAR]] (Stanford Positron-Electron Asymmetric Ring)  [[particle accelerator]] with the help of another Stanford physics professor, [[David Ritson]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.slac.stanford.edu/vault/pubvault/ST04no2_Allen.pdf|title=Deeper and Deeper into the Atom|access-date=15 September 2019|journal=Sandstone and Tile|publisher=Stanford Historical Society|volume=4|issue=2|date=Winter 1980|author=Peter C.

With it he led a team that discovered a new [[subatomic particle]] he called a ''ψ'' ([[psi (letter)|psi]]). This discovery was also made by the team led by [[Samuel C. C. Ting|Samuel Ting]]  at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]], but he called the particle ''J''.  The particle thus became known as the [[J/ψ meson]]. Richter and Ting were jointly awarded the 1976 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for their work.<ref name=":0" />

Richter is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President [[George W. Bush]] in May of 2008, urging him to "reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill" by requesting additional emergency funding for the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]’s [[Office of Science]], the [[National Science Foundation]], and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=A Letter from America's Physics Nobel Laureates|url=https://fire.pppl.gov/nobel_bush_fy08_050808.pdf}}</ref>

In 2014, President Obama also awarded Richter the 2012 [[National Medal of Science]]. His citation read, "For pioneering contributions to the development of electron accelerators, including circular and linear colliders, synchrotron light sources, and for discoveries in elementary particle physics and contributions to energy policy."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalmedals.org/laureates/burton-richter|title=Burton Richter, 2012 National Medal of Science, Physical Sciences|date=2019|website=National Science & Technology Medal Foundation|access-date=15 Sep 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory|title=President Obama Bestows National Medal of Science on SLAC Director Emeritus and Nobelist Burton Richter|date=2014-11-20|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/slaclab/15660865247/|access-date=2019-09-15}}</ref>
