'''George Davis Snell''' [[National  Academy  of  Sciences|NAS]] (December 19, 1903 â€“ June 6, 1996) was an American mouse [[geneticist]] and basic [[Organ transplant|transplant]] [[immunologist]].

==Work==

George Snell shared the 1980 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] with [[Baruj Benacerraf]] and [[Jean Dausset]] for their discoveries concerning "genetically determined structures on the cell surface that regulate immunological reactions". Snell specifically "discovered the genetic factors that determine the possibilities of transplanting tissue from one individual to another. It was Snell who introduced the concept of H [[antigen]]s."[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1980/press.html] Snell's work in mice led to the discovery of [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA]], the major histocompatibility complex, in humans (and all vertebrates) that is analogous to the H-2 complex in mice. Recognition of these key genes was prerequisite to successful tissue and [[organ transplant]]ation.

==Life==

George Snell was born in [[Bradford, Massachusetts]], the youngest of three children. His father (who was born in [[Minnesota]]), worked as a secretary for the local [[YMCA]]; he invented a device for winding induction coils for motorboat engines. Snell was educated in the [[Brookline, Massachusetts]] schools and then enrolled at [[Dartmouth College]] in [[Hanover, New Hampshire]] where he continued his passion for mathematics and science, focusing on genetics. He received his [[bachelor's degree]] from Dartmouth in 1926.

On the recommendation of John Gerould, his genetics professor at Dartmouth, Snell did graduate work at [[Harvard University]] with [[William E. Castle]], the first American biologist to look for [[Mendelian inheritance]] in mammals. Snell earned his [[PhD]] from Harvard in 1930. His doctoral thesis was on [[genetic linkage]] in mice.

Upon receiving the PhD from [[Harvard]], George Snell was employed as a teacher at [[Brown University]], from 1930~1931.

Snell then spent two years as a postdoctoral fellow at the [[University of Texas]] with [[H.J. Muller]], who pioneered radiation genetics (and was also to win a [[Nobel Prize]]). Not surprisingly, Snell studied the genetic effects of x-rays on mice with Muller.

This experience "served to convince me that research was my real love," Snell wrote in his autobiography.[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1980/snell-autobio.html]"If it were to be research, mouse genetics was the clear choice and the [[Jackson Laboratory]], founded in 1929 by [[C. C. Little|Dr. Clarence Cook Little]], one of Castle's earlier students, almost the inevitable selection as a place to work." The Jackson Laboratory was (and still is) the world's mecca for mouse genetics.

From 1933~1934, Snell was a teacher at [[WUSTL]].

After brief stints as teachers, in 1935 Snell joined the staff of The Jackson Laboratory in [[Bar Harbor, Maine|Bar Harbor]] on beautiful [[Mount Desert Island]] by the coast of [[Maine]] and he remained there for the entire balance of his long career. In Bar Harbor, he met and married Rhoda Carson. Together they had three sons, Thomas, Roy, and Peter. In his leisure time, Snell enjoyed skiing, a passion he developed during his years at Dartmouth, as well as tennis.

Snell received the Cancer Research Institute [[William B. Coley Award]] in 1978 for distinguished research in immunology. In 1988, he authored a substantial book, ''Search for a Rational Ethic'', on the nature of ethics and the rules by which we live. It includes an [[evolution]]-based ethic founded on biological realities that he believed to be applicable to all human beings.

Snell died in [[Bar Harbor, Maine]] on June 6, 1996. His wife died in 1994.
