== Early career ==
In 1987, Muratov began working as a correspondent for ''Volzhsky Komsomolets'' newspaper. His superiors were so impressed that by the end of his first year he was appointed to head of the ''[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]]'' youth department, and later was promoted to editor of news articles.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hr.puntomarinero.com/dmitry-muratov-biography-journalistic-activities/|title=Dmitry Muratov: biografija, novinarske aktivnosti}}</ref> Muratov left Komsomolskaya Pravda in 1992.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Yablokov|first=Ilya|title=Nobel peace prize: how Dmitry Muratov built Russia's 'bravest' newspaper, Novaya Gazeta|url=http://theconversation.com/nobel-peace-prize-how-dmitry-muratov-built-russias-bravest-newspaper-novaya-gazeta-169560|access-date=8 October 2021|website=The Conversation|language=en}}</ref>

== ''Novaya Gazeta'' ==
In 1993, Muratov and 50+ other colleagues from ''Komsomolskaya Pravda'' left to start their own paper titled ''Novaya Gazeta''. Their goal was to create a publication that was "an honest, independent, and rich"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cpj.org/awards/muratov-2/|title=Dmitry Muratov, Editor of Novaya Gazeta, Russia}}</ref> source for the citizens of Russia. The newspaper’s mission is to conduct in-depth investigations into human rights issues, corruption and abuse of power. ''Novaya Gazeta''{{’}}s newsroom started out with two computers, two rooms, one printer and no salary for the employees. Former Soviet President [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] generously donated some of his Nobel Peace Prize money to pay for salaries and computers for the paper. Muratov helped to create ''Novaya Gazeta'', where he was named Deputy Press Editor.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/15/11/2019/5dce8fab9a7947c2d1c81745|title=Главным редактором "Новой газеты" вновь избрали Дмитрия Муратова|website=РБК}}</ref>

In December 1994 – January 1995, Muratov was a correspondent in the war zone of the [[First Chechen War]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name="amorlatinoamericano 2019" />

In 1995, he became the head of the editorial board, a position he held until 2017, when he said he would not run for reelection. In 2019, Muratov ran for and was re-elected to the head of the editorial board of the ''Novaya Gazeta''.<ref name=":2" />

''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' is known as one of the "only truly critical newspapers with national influence in Russia today" by the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]]. Muratov often reported on sensitive topics including human rights violations, high-level government corruption, and abuse of power. His political beliefs, such as supporting freedom of press, has led to conflict with fellow journalists and the government.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Lundstrom|first=Hedvig|date=3 June 2016|title=Biography of 2016 Golden Pen of Freedom Laureate Dmitry Muratov|url=https://archive.wan-ifra.org/articles/2016/06/03/biography-of-2016-golden-pen-of-freedom-laureate-dmitry-muratov|website=[[World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers]]}}</ref>

In 2004, the newspaper printed seven articles by columnist Georgy Rozhnov, which accused [[Sergey Kiriyenko]] of embezzling US$4.8 billion of [[International Monetary Fund]] funds in 1998 when he was [[Prime Minister of Russia]].<ref name="cjeskiriyenko"/> The newspaper based the accusations on a letter allegedly written to [[Colin Powell]] and signed by [[Congressman|U.S. Congressmen]] [[Philip Crane]], [[Mike Pence]], [[Charlie Norwood]], [[Dan Burton]] and [[Henry Bonilla]] and posted on the website of the American Defense Council.<ref name="punkd"/> The newspaper claimed that Kiriyenko had used some of the embezzled funds to purchase real estate in the United States. It was later claimed that the letter was a prank concocted by ''[[The eXile]]''.<ref name="punkd">{{cite news |last = Ames |first = Mark |author-link = Mark Ames |title = Double Punk'd!

After ''Novaya Gazeta'' published an investigation by journalist Denis Korotkov about Russian businessman [[Yevgeny Prigozhin]],<ref name="svoboda_october_2018">{{cite web |title=''Novaya Gazeta'' Report: 'Putin's Chef' Involved in Attacks, Killing |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/novaya-gazeta-reports-claims-of-putin-s-chef-involved-in-attacks-killing/29557806.html |date=22 October 2018 |website=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |access-date=20 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191003075042/https://www.rferl.org/a/novaya-gazeta-reports-claims-of-putin-s-chef-involved-in-attacks-killing/29557806.html |archive-date=3 October 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> in October 2018, Denis Korotkov and the editor-in-chief at ''Novaya Gazeta'' were the target of threatening deliveries of a severed ram's head and funeral flowers to the paper's offices.

''Novaya Gazeta'' published reports about [[anti-gay purges in Chechnya]] in 2017, where three men were allegedly killed, and dozens detained and intimidated. After publication, the Chechen Government denied the existence of persecutions in the Republic.<ref name="guardian_Apr_2_2017">{{cite web |title=Chechen police 'have rounded up more than 100 suspected gay men' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/02/chechen-police-rounded-up-100-gay-men-report-russian-newspaper-chechnya |last=Walker |first=Shaun |date=2 April 2017 |website=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=7 December 2019}}</ref>

The newspaper published the report by [[Elena Milashina]] and the list of 27 Chechens killed on 26 January 2017. The newspaper also addressed the report and the list to the Russian Government service, [[Investigative Committee of Russia]], and asked the Committee to investigate the data about the published list. While ''Novaya Gazeta'' calling names of 27 Chechens killed in the list, newspaper supposed that real number might be even more, of 56 Chechens killed that night.
The newspaper said that the allegedly killed Chechens were citizens of the Republic of Chechnya, who were detained by Governmental security service, put in custody inside a guarded territory owned by Traffic Police regiment in the City of [[Grozny]], and executed on 26 January with gunfire (several men brutally killed by asphyxiation<ref name="novaya_23_july_2019">{{cite web |title=Подвал имени Кадырова |trans-title=Basement named after Kadyrov |url=https://novayagazeta.ru/articles/2019/07/23/81341-kazarma-6 |date=23 July 2019 |last=Милашина|first=Елена |website=Новая Газета |access-date=28 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191229132014/https://novayagazeta.ru/articles/2019/07/23/81341-kazarma-6 |archive-date=29 December 2019 |url-status=live |language=ru }}</ref>) by State Security forces without filing any legal accusations.<ref name="novaya_july_11_2017">{{cite web |title=Союз журналистов Чечни опубликовал обращение к "Новой газете" |trans-title=The Union of Chechen Journalists has published an appeal to Novaya Gazeta |url=https://novayagazeta.ru/news/2017/07/11/133362-soyuz-zhurnalistov-chechni-opublikoval-otkrytoe-obraschenie-k-novoy-gazete |date=11 July 2017 |website=Новая Газета |language=ru |access-date=7 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191207183329/https://novayagazeta.ru/news/2017/07/11/133362-soyuz-zhurnalistov-chechni-opublikoval-otkrytoe-obraschenie-k-novoy-gazete?utm_source=txt |archive-date=7 December 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>
