'''Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo''' [[Salesians of Don Bosco|SDB]], [[Order of Liberty|GCL]] (born 3 February 1948) is an [[East Timorese]] [[Roman Catholic]] [[bishop]]. He openly denounced the brutal [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|Indonesian occupation of his country]]. In 1996, he shared the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] with [[José Ramos-Horta]] for working "towards a just and peaceful solution to the conflict in East Timor".

==Early life and religious vocation==
The fifth child of Domingos Vaz Filipe and Ermelinda Baptista Filipe, Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo was born in the village of Wailakama, near Vemasse, on the north coast of [[Portuguese Timor]]. His father, a schoolteacher, died two years after Belo was born. His childhood years were spent in Catholic schools at [[Baucau]] and Ossu, before he proceeded to the Dare minor seminary outside [[Dili]], from which he graduated in 1968. From 1969 until 1981, apart from periods of practical training (1974–1976) in East Timor and [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]], Belo was in [[Portugal]] and [[Rome]] where, having become a member of the [[Salesian Society]], he studied philosophy and theology before being ordained a priest in 1980. Returning to East Timor in 1981, Belo became a teacher for 20 months, and later director for two months, at the Salesian College at Fatumaca.

==Pastoral leadership==
On the resignation of [[Martinho da Costa Lopes]] in 1983, Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo was appointed Apostolic Administrator of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Díli|Dili diocese]], becoming head of the East Timor church and directly responsible to the Pope. On 6 February 1989, he was consecrated titular Bishop of Lorium.<ref>Fernandes, C. The Independence of East Timor. Sussex Academic Press 2011.</ref>

Belo was the choice of the Vatican's Pro [[Nuncio]] in [[Jakarta]] and the [[Indonesia]]n leaders because of his supposed submissiveness, but he was not the choice of the Timorese priests who did not attend his inauguration. However within only five months of his assuming office, he protested vehemently, in a sermon in the cathedral, against the brutalities of the Kraras massacre (1983) and condemned the many Indonesian arrests. The church was the only institution capable of communicating with the outside world, so with this in mind the new Apostolic Administrator started writing letters and building up overseas contacts, in spite of the isolation arising from the opposition of the Indonesians and the disinterest of most of the world.

In February 1989 he wrote to the President of Portugal, the Pope, and the UN Secretary-General, calling for a UN referendum on the future of East Timor and for international help for the East Timorese, who were "dying as a people and a nation", but when the UN letter became public in April, he became even more of a target of the Indonesians. This precariousness increased when Belo gave sanctuary in his own home, as he did on various occasions, to youths escaping the [[Dili Massacre|Santa Cruz massacre]] (1991), and endeavoured to expose the numbers of victims killed.

Belo's labours on behalf of the East Timorese and in pursuit of peace and reconciliation were internationally recognised when, along with [[José Ramos-Horta]], he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in December 1996. Belo capitalised upon this honour through meetings with [[Bill Clinton]] of the United States and [[Nelson Mandela]] of South Africa. In 1995, he also won the [[John Humphrey Freedom Award]] from the Canadian human rights group [[Rights & Democracy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dd-rd.ca/site/humphrey_award/index.php?subsection=about_the_award |title=John Humphrey Freedom Award 2009 |year=2010 |publisher=Rights & Democracy |access-date=11 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927210443/http://www.dd-rd.ca/site/humphrey_award/index.php?subsection=about_the_award |archive-date=27 September 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref>

==Resignation as Apostolic Administrator and new pastoral activity==
In the aftermath of East Timorese independence on 20 May 2002, the pressure of events and the ongoing stress he endured began to show their effects on Belo's health. [[Pope John Paul II]] accepted his resignation as [[Apostolic Administrator]] of Dili on 26 November 2002.

Following his resignation Belo travelled to Portugal for medical treatment. By the beginning of 2004, there were repeated calls for him to return to East Timor and to run for the office of president. However, in May 2004 he told Portuguese state-run television [[RTP (Portugal)|RTP]], that he would not allow his name to be put up for nomination. "I have decided to leave politics to politicians," he stated. One month later, on 7 June 2004, Pascuál Chavez, rector major of the Salesian Society, announced from Rome that Belo, returned to health, would take up a new assignment. In agreement with the [[Holy See]], he would go to [[Mozambique]] as a missionary, and live as a member of the Salesian Society in that country.

In a statement released on 8 June, Belo said that, following two meetings in 2003 and in 2004 with the Prefect of the [[Congregation for the Evangelisation of Peoples]], he would go on a mission to the Diocese of [[Maputo]], the capital of Mozambique, as he had wanted to since his youth.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} He started in July 2004; the same year he was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from [[CEU Cardinal Herrera University]].

In February 2011 Belo received the Prize for Lusophonic Personality of the Year, given by [[MIL: Movimento Internacional Lusófono]] in the Lisbon Academy of Sciences.
