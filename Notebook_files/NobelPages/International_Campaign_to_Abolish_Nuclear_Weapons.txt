The '''International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons''' (abbreviated to '''ICAN''', pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|k|æ|n}} {{respell|EYE|kan}}) is a global [[civil society]] coalition working to promote adherence to and full implementation of the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/disarmament/ptnw/index.html|title=United Nations Conference to Negotiate a Legally Binding Instrument to Prohibit Nuclear Weapons, Leading Towards their Total Elimination, 27 April to 22 May 2015|website=www.un.org|language=EN|access-date=2017-11-01}}</ref> The campaign helped bring about this treaty. ICAN was launched in 2007 and counts 607 partner organizations in 106 countries as of 2021.

The campaign received the [[2017 Nobel Peace Prize]] "for its work to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons and for its ground-breaking efforts to achieve a treaty-based prohibition of such weapons."<ref name=Nobel>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2017/|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 2017|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=6 October 2017}}</ref>

== Mission ==
ICAN seeks to shift the disarmament debate to focus on the humanitarian threat posed by nuclear weapons, drawing attention to their unique destructive capacity, their catastrophic health and environmental consequences, their indiscriminate targeting, the debilitating impact of a detonation on medical infrastructure and relief measures, and the long-lasting effects of radiation on the surrounding area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ippnw.org/pdf/2016-oewg-collective-health-appeal.pdf|title=The health and humanitarian case for banning and eliminating nuclear weapons.|last=IPPNW|date=2016|website=www.ippnw.org|publisher=IPPNW|access-date=12 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113151314/http://www.ippnw.org/pdf/2016-oewg-collective-health-appeal.pdf|archive-date=13 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Founders of ICAN were inspired by the success of the [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]], which was pivotal in bringing about the negotiation of the anti-personnel [[Ottawa Treaty|mine ban treaty]] in 1997. They sought to establish a similar campaign model.<ref>[http://www.icanw.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/THE-CAMPAIGN-TO-BAN-NUCLEAR-WEAPONS.pdf "The International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510113806/http://www.icanw.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/THE-CAMPAIGN-TO-BAN-NUCLEAR-WEAPONS.pdf |date=10 May 2017 }}, Ronald McCoy, 30 April 2016.</ref>

==Formation==
[[File:ICAN launch in Melbourne.jpg|thumb|Launch of the ICAN in Melbourne, Australia, in 2007.]]

In September 2006, the [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War]], itself awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, adopted a proposal at its biennial congress in Helsinki, Finland, to launch ICAN globally.<ref>[http://www.icanw.org/campaign/campaign-overview/campaign-timeline/ Campaign milestones 2006] ICAN website</ref> ICAN was launched publicly at two events, the first on 23 April 2007 in Melbourne, Australia, where funds had been raised to establish the campaign, and the second on 30 April 2007 in Vienna at a meeting of State parties to the [[Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons]]. National campaigns have been organized in dozens of countries in every region of the world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

The ICAN organization was awarded the [[2017 Nobel Peace Prize]], on 6 October 2017. The Nobel Peace Prize Press Statement reads: "for its work to draw attention to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons and for its ground-breaking efforts to achieve a treaty-based prohibition of such weapons [...] It is the firm conviction of the Norwegian Nobel Committee that ICAN, more than anyone else, has in the past year given the efforts to achieve a world without nuclear weapons a new direction and new vigour".<ref name=Nobel_press_release>{{Cite web | title = The Nobel Peace Prize for 2017 | publisher = The Norwegian Nobel Committee | date = 6 October 2017 | access-date = 6 October 2017 | url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2017/press.html }}</ref>

''[[The Economist]]'' expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of ICAN's nuclear-ban treaty, arguing that it was unlikely to advance global peace due to its rejection by the world's nuclear powers.<ref name="veconomist" >{{cite news|title=This year's Nobel peace prize rewards a nice but pointless idea|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21730075-banning-nuclear-weapons-will-not-do-much-advance-cause-peace-years-nobel|work=[[The Economist]]|date=6 October 2017}}</ref>

The Nobel Prize has brought significant attention to ICAN's core issues, and membership of affiliate groups and partners have jumped to over 450 organisation worldwide, bringing the core issues squarely into remit of international law.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/08/06/national/ican-champions-grass-roots-efforts-persuade-japan-others-support-nuclear-free-world/#.W2wBKDfqbIU|title = ICAN champions grass-roots efforts to persuade Japan and others to support a nuclear-free world|date = 6 August 2018}}</ref>
