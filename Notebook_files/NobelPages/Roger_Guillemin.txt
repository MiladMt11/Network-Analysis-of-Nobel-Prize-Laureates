'''Roger Charles Louis Guillemin''' (born January 11, 1924) is a French-American neuroscientist. He received the [[National Medal of Science]] in 1976, and the [[Nobel prize]] for [[medicine]] in 1977 for his work on [[neurohormone]]s, sharing the prize that year with [[Andrew Schally]] and [[Rosalyn Sussman Yalow]].

==Biography==
Completing his undergraduate work at the [[University of Burgundy]], Guillemin received his M.D. degree from the Medical Faculty at [[University of Lyon|Lyon]] in 1949, and went to [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada, to work with [[Hans Selye]] at the Institute of Experimental Medicine and Surgery at the [[Université de Montréal]] where he received a Ph.D. in 1953. The same year he moved to the United States to join the faculty at [[Baylor College of Medicine]] at [[Houston, Texas|Houston]]. In 1965, he became a [[United States nationality law|naturalized citizen of the United States]]. In 1970 he helped to set up the [[Salk Institute]] in [[La Jolla, California]] where he worked until retirement in 1989.

Guillemin and [[Andrew V. Schally]] discovered the structures of [[TRH]] and [[GnRH]] in separate laboratories. The process of this scientific discovery at Guillemin's laboratory is the subject of a study by [[Bruno Latour]] and [[Steve Woolgar]], published as ''[[Laboratory Life]]''.<ref> [[Bruno Latour|Latour, Bruno]]; [[Steve Woolgar|Woolgar, Steve]] (1986). ''[[Laboratory Life]]''. Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-691-02832-3}}.</ref>

Guillemin signed along with other Nobel Prize winners a petition requesting a delegation of the Committee on the Rights of the Children of the [[United Nations]] to visit a Tibetan child who is under house arrest in China since 1995, namely [[Gendhun Choekyi Nyima]], recognized as the 11th [[Panchen Lama]] by the 14th [[Dalai Lama]], [[Tenzin Gyatso]].
