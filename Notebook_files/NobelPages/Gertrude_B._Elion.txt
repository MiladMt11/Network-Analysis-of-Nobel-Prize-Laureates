== Personal life ==
Soon after graduating from Hunter College, Elion met Leonard Canter, an outstanding statistics student at [[City College of New York]] (CCNY).  They planned to marry, but Leonard became ill.  On June 25, 1941, he died from [[bacterial endocarditis]], an infection of his heart valves.<ref name="McDowell">{{cite journal|last1=McDowell|first1=Julie L.|date=2002|title=A lifetime quest for a cure|url=http://pubs.acs.org/subscribe/archive/mdd/v05/i10/pdf/1002timeline.pdf|journal=Modern Drug Discovery|issue=October|pages=51–52|access-date=February 14, 2018}}</ref> In her Nobel interview, she stated that this furthered her drive to become a research scientist and pharmacologist.

Elion never married or had children.<ref name="Stille" />{{rp|page=65}} However, her brother, whom she was close with, married and had two sons and a daughter that she took pride in being able to watch grow. She listed her hobbies as photography, travel, opera and ballet, and listening to music.<ref name="Nobel">{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1988/elion-autobio.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1988: Sir James W.

She retired in 1983 from Burroughs Wellcome to spend more time traveling and attending the opera. She continued to make important scientific contributions after her retirement.<ref name=":0" /> One of her passions during this time was encouraging other women to pursue a career in science.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|title=Gertrude Belle Elion (1918-1999)|journal=Science|volume=284|issue=5419|pages=1480|last=Colvin|first=Micheal|date=May 28, 1999|doi=10.1126/science.284.5419.1480|pmid=10383327|s2cid=45055062}}</ref>

Gertrude Elion died in North Carolina in 1999, aged 81.<ref name="Stille" />{{rp|page=76}}

== Career and research ==
While Elion had many jobs to support herself and put herself through school, Elion had also worked for the [[National Cancer Institute]], [[American Association for Cancer Research]], and [[World Health Organization]], among other organizations. From 1967 to 1983, she was the Head of the Department of Experimental Therapy for [[GlaxoSmithKline|Burroughs Wellcome]]. She officially retired from Burroughs and Wellcome in 1983.

She was affiliated with [[Duke University]] as Adjunct Professor of Pharmacology and of Experimental Medicine from 1971 to 1983 and Research Professor from 1983 to 1999.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wayne|first1=Tiffany K.|title=American Women of Science Since 1900: Essays A–H. Vol. 1|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, CA|isbn=978-1598841589|page=370}}</ref> During her time at Duke, she focused on mentoring medical and graduate students. She published more than 25 papers with the students she mentored at Duke.<ref name=":2" />

Even after her retirement from Burroughs Wellcome, Gertrude continued almost full time work at the lab. She played a significant role in the development of AZT, one of the first drugs used to treat HIV and AIDS.<ref name=":1" /> She also was crucial in the development of Nelarabine, which she worked on until her death in 1999.<ref name=":0" />

Rather than relying on trial-and-error, Elion and Hitchings discovered new drugs using rational drug design, which used the differences in biochemistry and metabolism between normal human cells and [[pathogen]]s (disease-causing agents such as cancer cells, protozoa, bacteria, and viruses) to design drugs that could kill or inhibit the reproduction of particular pathogens without harming human cells. The drugs they developed are used to treat a variety of maladies, such as leukemia, malaria, lupus, hepatitis, arthritis, gout,<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite web|url=https://jwa.org/womenofvalor/elion|title=Gertrude Elion {{!}} Jewish Women's Archive|website=jwa.org|access-date=2019-04-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180519221129/https://jwa.org/womenofvalor/elion|archive-date=May 19, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> organ transplant rejection ([[azathioprine]]), as well as herpes ([[acyclovir]], which was the first selective and effective drug of its kind).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wasserman|first1=Elga R.|title=The door in the dream : conversations with eminent women in science|date=2000|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|isbn=978-0-309-06568-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/doorindream00elga/page/47 47]|url=https://archive.org/details/doorindream00elga/page/47}}</ref> Most of Elion's early work came from the use and development of [[purine]] derivatives.
