==Personal life==

===Early years===
Born in [[Mineola, New York|Mineola]], [[New York (state)|New York]], Wilczek is of Polish and Italian origin.<ref name="Nobel autobiography"/> His grandparents were immigrants, who "really did work with their hands," according to Wilczek, but Frank's father took night school classes to educate himself, working as a repairman to support his family.<ref name="AIP2020">{{Cite web |url=https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/44536 |title=Oral history interview with Frank Wilczek, 2020 June 4 |last=Wilczek |first=Frank |publisher=AIP |quote=Somewhere between working class and lower middle class. Yeah, lower middle class, I guess I would say. Unlike my grandparents, who really did work with their hands, my father, as I said, was kind of a technician and repairman. He actually got very good at the job and was rising through the ranks. |date=September 15, 2020 |access-date=September 18, 2020}}</ref> Wilczek's father became a "self-taught engineer," whose interests in technology and science inspired his son.<ref name="sU2018">{{Cite web |url=https://www.su.se/english/research/profile-areas/astrophysics-cosmology-and-particle-physics/the-nobel-laureate-who-got-hooked-on-stockholm-1.309112
 |title=The Nobel laureate who got hooked on Stockholm  |publisher=Stockholm University |quote=Frank Wilczek’s story starts in Queens, New York, where he grew up in a working-class family with roots in Europe. They were children of the Great Depression from Long Island and had limited access to resources, but that didn’t stop them from working to educate themselves. Frank’s father was a self-taught engineer and passed his interest in technology and science on to his son. |date=September 15, 2020 |access-date=September 18, 2020}}</ref>

Wilczek was educated in the public schools of [[Queens, New York|Queens]], attending [[Martin Van Buren High School (New York City)|Martin Van Buren High School]]. It was around this time Wilczek's parents realized that he was exceptional—in part as a result of Frank Wilczek having been administered an [[IQ test]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Dreifus|first=Claudia|title=Discovering the Mathematical Laws of Nature|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/29/science/29conv.html?_r=1|access-date=22 May 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 28, 2009}}</ref>

After skipping two grades, Wilczek started high school in the 10th grade, when he was 13 years old. He was particularly inspired by two of his high school physics teachers, one of whom taught a course that helped students with the national [[Westinghouse Science Talent Search]]. Wilczek was a finalist in 1967 and ultimately won fourth place, based on a mathematical project involving [[group theory]].<ref name="UFT2018">{{Cite web |url=https://www.uft.org/news/feature-stories/noteworthy-graduates/noteworthy-graduates-frank-wilczek-nobel-laureate-physics |title=Noteworthy graduates: Frank Wilczek, Nobel laureate in physics  |publisher=United Federation of Teachers |quote=As a high school senior, Wilczek was a finalist in the national Science Talent Search.

===Education===
He received his [[Bachelor of Science]] in [[Mathematics]] and membership in [[Phi Beta Kappa]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docplayer.net/31086301-Frank-wilczek-curriculum-vitae.html|title=FRANK WILCZEK CURRICULUM VITAE - PDF|website=docplayer.net}}</ref> at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1970. During his last year as a math major at Chicago, he attended a course taught by [[Peter Freund]] on [[group theory]] in physics, which Wilczek later described as being "basically [[particle physics]]," and very influential:<ref name="AIP2020"/>
<blockquote>Peter Freund played a big role in my life, though, because he taught this course on group theory, or [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetry in physics]] that—he was so enthusiastic, and he really gushed—and it’s beautiful material. Still to this day I think the [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] theory of angular momentum is one of the absolute pinnacles of human achievement. Just beautiful.</blockquote>

Wilczek went to Princeton as a mathematics graduate student. After a year and a half, he transferred from mathematics to physics, with [[David Gross]] as his thesis advisor.<ref name="AIP2020"/>

He earned a Master of Arts in Mathematics  in 1972 and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in physics in 1974, both from [[Princeton University]]<ref>{{MathGenealogy|id=94768|title=Frank Anthony Wilczek}}</ref>

===Family===
Wilczek met [[Betsy Devine]] at Princeton, when both watched the televised [[World Chess Championship 1972|1972 Fisher-Spassky chess matches]].<ref name="MIT_2004">{{Cite web |url=https://news.mit.edu/2004/nobel-conf |title=Wilczek thanks family, country and Mother Nature |last=Thompson |first=Elizabeth A |work=MIT News |quote='I noticed that whatever moves Frank called out, the players would do what he said.

===Religious views===
Wilczek was raised [[Catholic]] but later "lost faith in conventional religion".<ref name="Nobel autobiography"/> He has been described as an [[agnostic]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://slate.com/culture/2015/08/frank-wilczeks-a-beautiful-question-reviewed.html|title=Why Is the World So Beautiful?

===Science outreach and activism===
Wilczek is a member of the Scientific Advisory Board for the [[Future of Life Institute]], an organization that works to mitigate [[Global catastrophic risk|existential risks]] facing humanity, particularly [[Existential risk from artificial general intelligence|existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence]].<ref>{{Citation

In 2014, Wilczek penned a letter, along with [[Stephen Hawking]] and two other scholars, warning that "Success in creating [[Artificial Intelligence|AI]] would be the biggest event in human history. Unfortunately, it might also be the last, unless we learn how to avoid the risks."<ref>{{cite news|title=Stephen Hawking: 'Transcendence looks at the implications of artificial intelligence - but are we taking AI seriously enough?'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/stephen-hawking-transcendence-looks-at-the-implications-of-artificial-intelligence-but-are-we-taking-9313474.html|access-date=28 January 2016|work=[[The Independent (UK)]]|date=1 May 2014}}</ref>

Wilczek is also a supporter of the [[Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]], an organization which advocates for democratic reform in the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://en.unpacampaign.org/supporters/overview/page/5/?mapcountry=allpro&mapgroup=pro|title=Overview|work=Campaign for a UN Parliamentary Assembly|access-date=2017-10-27|language=en-US}}</ref>

Wilczek has appeared on an episode of ''[[Penn & Teller: Bullshit!]]'', where [[Penn Jillette|Penn]] referred to him as "the smartest person [they have] ever had on the show."

===Honors===

In 1982, he was awarded a [[MacArthur Fellowship]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.macfound.org/fellows/130/ |title=Frank Wilczek - MacArthur Foundation |website=www.macfound.org |access-date=2019-01-19}}</ref>

Wilczek |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |archive-date=14 February 2016 |access-date=14 February 2016}}</ref> He was awarded the [[Lorentz Medal]] in 2002.  Wilczek won the [[Lilienfeld Prize]] of the [[American Physical Society]] in 2003.  In the same year he was awarded the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics Commemorative Medal from [[Charles University]] in Prague.  He was the co-recipient of the 2003 High Energy and Particle Physics Prize of the [[European Physical Society]].  The Nobel Prize in Physics 2004 was awarded jointly to [[David J. Gross]], [[H. David Politzer]] and Frank Wilczek "for the discovery of asymptotic freedom in the theory of the strong interaction." Wilczek was also the co-recipient of the 2005 [[King Faisal International Prize for Science]]. In that same year, he received the Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Golden Plate Awardees of the American Academy of Achievement |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://achievement.org/our-history/golden-plate-awards/#science-exploration}}</ref> On January 25, 2013, Wilczek received an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from the Faculty of Science and Technology at [[Uppsala University]], Sweden.<ref>{{Cite web|title = New honorary doctorates in science and technology - Uppsala University, Sweden|url = http://www.uu.se/en/research/grants-awards/article/?id=2263&area=12,16&typ=artikel&lang=en|website = www.uu.se|access-date = 2016-02-03}}</ref> He also served on the Physical Sciences jury for the Infosys Prize from 2009 to 2011.

Wilczek holds the [[Herman Feshbach]] Professorship of Physics at [[MIT Center for Theoretical Physics]]. He has also worked at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton and the [[Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics|Institute for Theoretical Physics]] at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] and was also a visiting professor at [[NORDITA]].

==Research==
Wilczek's 2004 Nobel Prize was for asymptotic freedom, but he has helped reveal and develop [[axion]]s, [[anyon]]s, [[asymptotic freedom]], the [[color superconductivity|color superconducting]] phases of [[quark matter]], and other aspects of [[quantum field theory]]. He has worked on [[condensed matter physics]], [[astrophysics]], and [[particle physics]].

===Asymptotic freedom===
In 1973, while a graduate student working with [[David Gross]] at [[Princeton University]], Wilczek (together with Gross) discovered [[asymptotic freedom]], which holds that the closer [[quarks]] are to each other, the less the [[strong interaction]] (or [[color charge]]) between them; when quarks are in extreme proximity, the nuclear force between them is so weak that they behave almost as free particles. The theory, which was independently discovered by [[H. David Politzer]], was important for the development of [[quantum chromodynamics]]. According to the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] when awarding Wilczek its Lorentz Medal in 2002,<ref name="knaw">[https://www.knaw.nl/en/awards/laureates/lorentzmedaille/lorentzmedaille-2002-voor-amerikaanse-fysicus Lorentz Medal: Frank Wilczek (2002)]</ref> <blockquote>This <nowiki>[asymptotic freedom]</nowiki> is a phenomenon whereby the building blocks which make up the nucleus of an atom - 'quarks' - behave as free particles when they are close together, but become more strongly attracted to each other as the distance between them increases. This theory forms the key to the interpretation of almost all experimental studies involving modern particle accelerators.</blockquote>

===Axions===
{{main|Axion}}
The axion is a hypothetical [[elementary particle]]. If axions exist and have low mass within a specific range, they are of interest as a possible component of [[cold dark matter]].

In 1977, [[Roberto Peccei]] and [[Helen Quinn]] postulated a solution to the strong CP problem, the [[Peccei–Quinn theory|Peccei–Quinn mechanism]]. This is accomplished by adding a new global symmetry (called a [[Peccei–Quinn symmetry]].) When that symmetry is  spontaneously broken, a new particle results, as shown independently by Wilczek and by [[Steven Weinberg]].<ref>{{cite journal |title = Problem of Strong ''P'' and ''T'' Invariance in the Presence of Instantons | author = Wilczek, F.

Although most experimental searches for dark matter candidates have targeted [[Weakly interacting massive particles|WIMP]]s, there have also been many attempts to detect axions.<ref>[https://physics.aps.org/articles/v11/34 "Homing in on Axions?"

But axions have since become a popular explanation for dark matter, the mysterious substance that makes up 85% of the mass of the universe, yet emits no light. |date=June 17, 2020 |access-date=September 22, 2020}}</ref><ref name="SciAm2020">{{Cite web |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-dark-matter-made-of-axions/ |title=Is Dark Matter Made of Axions? |last=Falk |first=Dan |work=Scientific American |quote=Then, in 1977 Helen Quinn and the late Roberto Peccei, both then at Stanford University, proposed a solution: perhaps there is a hitherto unknown field that pervades all of space and suppresses the neutron’s asymmetries.

===Anyons===
{{main|Anyon}}
In [[physics]], an anyon is a type of [[quasiparticle]] that occurs only in [[two-dimensional|''two''-dimensional]] [[physical system|systems]], with properties much less restricted than [[fermion]]s and [[boson]]s. In particular, anyons can have properties intermediate between fermions and bosons, including fractional electric charge. This anything-goes behavior inspired Wilczek in 1982 to name them "anyons."<ref name="SymMag2011">{{Cite web |url=https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/breaking/2011/08/31/anyons-anyone |title=Anyons, anyone?  |work=Symmetry Magazine |quote=In 1982 physicist Frank Wilczek gave these interstitial particles the name anyon...'Any anyon can be anything between a boson or a fermion,' Keilmann says.

In 1977, a group of [[Theoretical physics|theoretical physicists]] working at the [[University of Oslo]], led by [[Jon Magne Leinaas|Jon Leinaas]] and [[Jan Myrheim]], calculated that the traditional division between fermions and bosons would not apply to theoretical particles existing in two [[dimension]]s.<ref name=WilczekJan2006>{{cite journal|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/indepth/23894 |title=From electronics to anyonics|first=Frank|last= Wilczek|journal= Physics World|date=January 2006|year=2006|volume=19|pages=22–23|doi=10.1088/2058-7058/19/1/31|quote=In the early 1980s I named the hypothetical new particles 'anyons,' the idea being that anything goes – but I did not lose much sleep anticipating their discovery.

Frank Wilczek, Dan Arovas, and [[Robert Schrieffer]] analyzed the fractional quantum Hall effect in 1984, proving that anyons were required to describe it.<ref name="Milestone2020">{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/story/milestone-evidence-for-anyons-a-third-kingdom-of-particles/ |title='Milestone' Evidence for Anyons, a Third Kingdom of Particles |last=Najjar |first=Dana |magazine=Wired |quote=In the early 1980s, physicists first used these conditions to observe the 'fractional quantum Hall effect,' in which electrons come together to create so-called quasiparticles that have a fraction of the charge of a single electron.

In 1984, a seminal two-page paper by Wilczek, Daniel Arovas and John Robert Schrieffer showed that these quasiparticles had to be anyons. |date=May 12, 2020 |access-date=September 18, 2020}}</ref><ref name="Bunch2020">{{Cite web |url=https://physicsworld.com/a/anyons-bunch-together-in-a-2d-conductor/ |title=Anyons bunch together in a 2D conductor |last=Dumé |first=Isabelle |work=Physics World |quote=The existence of anyons – which get their name from the fact that their behaviour is neither fermion-like or boson-like – was predicted in the early 1980s by the theoretical physicist Frank Wilczek. Soon afterwards, another physicist, Bert Halperin, found that anyons could explain certain aspects of the fractional quantum Hall effect, which describes the changes that take place in electronics at low temperatures in strong magnetic fields. Then, in 1984, Dan Arovas, Bob Schrieffer and Wilczek proved that a successful theory of the fractional quantum Hall effect does indeed require particles that are neither bosons or fermions. |date=May 28, 2020 |access-date=September 26, 2020}}</ref>
