Ohsumi was born on February 9, 1945, in [[Fukuoka, Japan]]. He received a [[B.Sci.]] in 1967 and a D.Sci. in 1974, both from the [[University of Tokyo]]. In 1974–77 he was a [[postdoctoral fellow]] at the [[Rockefeller University]] in New York City.<ref name=orcid/>

He returned to the University of Tokyo in 1977 as a [[research associate]]; he was appointed Lecturer there in 1986, and promoted to Associate Professor in 1988. In 1996 he moved to the [[National Institute for Basic Biology, Japan]] in [[Okazaki City]], Japan. where he was appointed as a professor. From 2004 to 2009 he was also professor at the [[Graduate University for Advanced Studies (Japan)|Graduate University for Advanced Studies]] in [[Hayama]], Japan. In 2009 he transitioned to a three-way appointment as an [[emeritus professor]] at the National Institute for Basic Biology and at the [[Graduate University for Advanced Studies (Japan)|Graduate University for Advanced Studies]], and a professorship at the Advanced Research Organization, Integrated Research Institute, [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]] (Tokyo Tech). After his retirement in 2014, he continued to serve as Professor at Institute of Innovative Research, Tokyo Institute of Technology. Currently, he is head of the Cell Biology Research Unit, Institute of Innovative Research, Tokyo Institute of Technology.<ref name=titech>{{cite web|title=Yoshinori Ohsumi Biography|url=http://www.ohsumilab.aro.iri.titech.ac.jp/ohsumieng.html|publisher=Institute of Innovative Research, Tokyo Institute of Technology|access-date=10 October 2016}}</ref>

[[Christian de Duve]] coined the term [[autophagy]] in 1963 whereas Ohsumi began his work in 1988. Prior to that time, less than 20 papers per year were published on this subject.<ref name=MoleCluesTV>{{cite web|title=Yoshinori Ohsumi: What is autophagy?
