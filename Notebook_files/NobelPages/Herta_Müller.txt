'''Herta Müller''' ({{IPA-de|ˈhɛʁ.ta ˈmʏ.lɐ|lang|De-Herta Müller.ogg}}; born 17 August 1953) is a Romanian-born German novelist, poet, essayist and recipient of the 2009 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Born in [[Nițchidorf]] ({{lang-de|Nitzkydorf|link=no}}), [[Timiș County]] in Romania, her native language is German. Since the early 1990s, she has been internationally established, and her works have been translated into more than twenty languages.<ref>[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4774078,00.html "Literaturnobelpreis geht an Herta Müller"] by Thomas Grimmer, [[Deutsche Welle]], 8 October 2009. Retrieved on 6 January 2021.</ref>

Müller is noted for her works depicting the effects of violence, cruelty and terror, usually in the setting of the [[Socialist Republic of Romania]] under the repressive [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] regime which she has experienced herself. Many of her works are told from the viewpoint of the [[Germans of Romania|German minority in Romania]] and are also a depiction of the modern history of the Germans in the [[Banat]] and [[Transylvania]]. Her much acclaimed 2009 novel ''[[The Hunger Angel]]'' (''Atemschaukel'') portrays the [[deportation]] of Romania's German minority to [[Gulag|Soviet Gulags]] during the [[Soviet occupation of Romania]] for use as [[Forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union|German forced labor]].

Müller has received more than twenty awards to date, including the [[Kleist Prize]] (1994), the [[Aristeion Prize]] (1995), the [[International Dublin Literary Award]] (1998) and the [[Franz Werfel Human Rights Award]] (2009). On 8 October 2009, the [[Swedish Academy]] announced that she had been awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, describing her as a woman "who, with the concentration of poetry and the frankness of prose, depicts the landscape of the dispossessed".<ref name="nobelweb" />

== Early life ==
Müller was born to [[Banat Swabians|Banat Swabian]] [[Catholic]]<ref name="spiegel">{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/0,1518,658612,00.html|title=Preisverleihung in Frankfurt: Herta Müller rechnet mit evangelischer Kirche ab|work=[[Der Spiegel]]|access-date=2014-10-02}}</ref> farmers in [[Nițchidorf]] (German: Nitzkydorf; Hungarian: Niczkyfalva), up to the 1980s a German-speaking village in the [[Romanian Banat]] in southwestern Romania. Her family was part of [[Romania's German minority]]. Her grandfather had been a wealthy farmer and merchant, but his property was confiscated by the Communist regime. Her father was a member of the [[Waffen SS]] during [[World War II]], and earned a living as a truck driver in Communist Romania.<ref name=nobelweb /> In 1945, her mother, then aged 17, was among 100,000 of the German minority [[deportation|deported]] to [[Forced labor of Germans in the Soviet Union|forced labor camps in the Soviet Union]], from which she was released in 1950.<ref name=nobelweb /><ref>[http://cadmus.iue.it/dspace/bitstream/1814/2599/1/HEC04-01.pdf The Expulsion of 'German' Communities from Eastern Europe at the end of the Second World War] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001022039/http://cadmus.iue.it/dspace/bitstream/1814/2599/1/HEC04-01.pdf |date=2009-10-01 }}, Steffen Prauser and Arfon Rees, European University Institute, Florense.

Retrieved on 2009-10-26.</ref> She graduated from [[Nikolaus Lenau High School]] before becoming student of [[German studies]] and [[Romanian literature]] at [[West University of Timișoara]].

In 1976, Müller began working as a translator for an engineering factory, but was dismissed in 1979 for her refusal to cooperate with the [[Securitate]], the Communist regime's secret police. After her dismissal, she initially earned a living by teaching in [[kindergarten]] and giving private German lessons.

== Career ==
Müller's first book, ''Niederungen'' (''[[Nadirs (autobiography)|Nadirs]]''), was published in Romania in German in 1982, receiving a prize from the Central Committee of the [[Union of Communist Youth]]. The book was about a child's view of the German-cultural Banat.<ref name="RFERL">{{cite web|url= http://www.rferl.org/content/Interview_With_Herta_Mueller/1847036.html|title= Interview With Herta Mueller |access-date=2009-10-08|publisher=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]}}</ref> Some members of the Banat Swabian community criticized Müller for "fouling her own nest" by her unsympathetic portrayal of village life.<ref>Ilka Scheidgen: Fünfuhrgespräche.

After being refused permission to emigrate to West Germany in 1985, Müller was finally allowed to leave along with her then-husband, novelist [[Richard Wagner (novelist)|Richard Wagner]], in 1987, and they settled in [[West Berlin]], where both still live.<ref>[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4775947,00.html Germany hails literature Nobel honor for Herta Mueller | Germany | Deutsche Welle | 8 October 2009]. Dw-world.de (2009-05-26). Retrieved on 2009-10-26.</ref> In the following years, she accepted lectureships at universities in Germany and abroad. Müller was elected to membership in the [[Deutsche Akademie für Sprache und Dichtung]] in 1995, and other honorary positions followed. In 1997, she withdrew from the [[International PEN|PEN]] centre of Germany in protest of its merger with the former [[German Democratic Republic]] branch. In July 2008, Müller sent a critical open letter to [[Horia-Roman Patapievici]], president of the [[Romanian Cultural Institute]] in reaction to the moral and financial support given by the institute to two former informants of the Securitate participating at the Romanian-German Summer School.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evz.ro/articole/detalii-articol/813306/Scandal-romanesc-cu-Securisti-zvastica-si-sex-la-Berlin-si-New-York/|title=EVZ.ro – Scandal românesc cu securiști, svastică și sex, la Berlin și New York|access-date=11 June 2017}}</ref>

The critic [[Denis Scheck]] described visiting Müller at her home in Berlin and seeing that her desk contained a drawer full of single letters cut from a newspaper she had entirely destroyed in the process. Realising that she used the letters to write texts,<ref>Due to Scheck's many grammar and vocabulary errors in the interview, it can be assumed Scheck didn't really mean "from those letters she was recombining her own literary texts" (3'45") and instead meant she was recombining the letters to write texts.</ref> he felt he had "entered the workshop of a true poet".<ref>[[BBC World Service]], ''[[The Strand (radio)|The Strand]]'', Interview with Denis Scheck about Herta Müller, Thursday 8 October 2009</ref>

''[[The Passport]]'', first published in Germany as ''Der Mensch ist ein großer Fasan auf der Welt'' in 1986, is, according to ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'', couched in the strange code engendered by repression: indecipherable because there is nothing specific to decipher, it is candid, but somehow beside the point, redolent of things unsaid. From odd observations the villagers sometimes make ("Man is nothing but a pheasant in the world"), to chapters titled after unimportant props ("The Pot Hole", "The Needle"), everything points to a strategy of displaced meaning ... Every such incidence of misdirection is the whole book in miniature, for although Ceausescu is never mentioned, he is central to the story, and cannot be forgotten. The resulting sense that anything, indeed everything – whether spoken by the characters or described by the author – is potentially dense with tacit significance means this short novel expands in the mind to occupy an emotional space far beyond its size or the seeming simplicity of its story."<ref>{{citation|title=The Passport|first=Tadzio|last=Koelb|date=1 January 2010|work=[[The Times Literary Supplement]]}}</ref>

== 2009 success ==

In 2009, Müller enjoyed the greatest international success of her career. Her novel ''Atemschaukel'' (published in English as ''[[The Hunger Angel]]'') was nominated for the [[Deutscher Buchpreis]] (German Book Prize) and won the [[Franz Werfel Human Rights Award]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.z-g-v.de/aktuelles/index.php3?id=977|title="Speech by Erika Steinbach on occasion of the award of the Franz Werfel Human Rights Award".|access-date=11 June 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607075533/http://www.z-g-v.de/aktuelles/index.php3?id=977|archive-date=7 June 2011}}</ref> In this book, Müller describes the journey of a young man to a gulag in the [[Soviet Union]], the fate of many Germans in [[Transylvania]] after World War II. It was inspired by the experience of poet [[Oskar Pastior]], whose memories she had made notes of, and also by what happened to her own mother.

In October 2009, the [[Swedish Academy]] announced its decision to award that year's Nobel Prize in Literature to Müller "who, with the concentration of poetry and the frankness of prose, depicts the landscape of the dispossessed."<ref name="nobelweb">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2009/|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 2009|access-date=2009-10-08|publisher=Nobelprize.org}}</ref> The academy compared Müller's style and her use of German as a minority language with [[Franz Kafka]] and pointed out the influence of Kafka on Müller. The award coincided with the 20th anniversary of the fall of communism. Michael Krüger, head of Müller's publishing house, said: "By giving the award to Herta Müller, who grew up in a German-speaking minority in Romania, the committee has recognized an author who refuses to let the inhumane side of life under communism be forgotten"<ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091008/ap_en_ot/eu_nobel_literature "Herta Mueller wins 2009 Nobel literature prize"], Yahoo! News.</ref>

In 2012, Müller commented on the Nobel Prize for [[Mo Yan]] by saying that the Swedish Academy had apparently chosen an author who 'celebrates censorship'.<ref>{{cite web |first=Alison |last=Flood |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/26/mo-yan-nobel-herta-muller |title=Mo Yan's Nobel nod a 'catastrophe', says fellow laureate Herta Müller German writer blasts decision to award this year's Nobel prize for literature to man who 'celebrates censorship' |work=The Guardian |date=26 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/18/108/60132/Books/World/Nobel-laureate-Mo-Yan-takes-swipe-at-critics-in-le.aspx|title=Nobel laureate Mo Yan takes swipe at critics in lecture|work=AFP via Ahram Online|date=9 December 2012|access-date=2012-12-09}}</ref>

On July 6, 2020 a no longer existing [[Twitter]] account published the fake news of Herta Müller's death, which was immediately disclaimed by her publisher.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/kultur-vergnuegen/totgetwittert-wie-falsche-meldungen-gemacht-werden-li.91664|title=Totgetwittert? Wie falsche Meldungen gemacht werden|first=Berliner|last=Zeitung|website=Berliner Zeitung}}</ref>

== Influences ==
Although Müller has revealed little about the specific people or books that have influenced her, she has acknowledged the importance of her university studies in German and Romanian literature, and particularly of the contrast between the two languages. "The two languages", the writer says, "look differently even at plants. In Romanian, 'snowdrops' are 'little tears', in German they are 'Schneeglöckchen', that is 'little snow bells', which means we're not only speaking about different words, but about different worlds." (However here she confuses snowdrops with [[lily-of-the-valley]], the latter being called 'little tears' in Romanian.) She continues, "Romanians see a falling star and say that someone has died, with the Germans you make a wish when you see the falling star." Romanian folk music is another influence: "When I first heard [[Maria Tănase]] she sounded incredible to me, it was for the first time that I really felt what folklore meant. Romanian folk music is connected to existence in a very meaningful way."<ref>[http://www.rri.ro/arh-art.shtml?lang=1&sec=13&art=4641 "An Evening with Herta Müller"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013180057/http://www.rri.ro/arh-art.shtml?lang=1&sec=13&art=4641 |date=2009-10-13 }}, Radio Romania International, 17 August 2007. Retrieved 26 January 2012.</ref>

Müller's work was also shaped by the many experiences she shared with her ex-husband, the novelist and essayist [[Richard Wagner (novelist)|Richard Wagner]]. Both grew up in Romania as members of the Banat Swabian ethnic group and enrolled in German and Romanian literary studies at [[West University of Timișoara|Timișoara University]]. Upon graduating, both worked as German-language teachers, and were members of Aktionsgruppe Banat, a literary society that fought for freedom of speech.

Müller's involvement with Aktionsgruppe Banat gave her the courage to write boldly, despite the threats and trouble generated by the Romanian secret police. Although her books are fictional, they are based on real people and experiences. Her 1996 novel, ''[[The Land of Green Plums]]'', was written after the deaths of two friends, in which Müller suspected the involvement of the secret police, and one of its characters was based on a close friend from Aktionsgruppe Banat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infloox.com/influence?id=6b8a8351|title=The Banat Action Group → Herta Mueller|publisher=Infloox|access-date=11 June 2017}}</ref>

== Letter from Liu Xia ==
Herta Müller wrote the foreword for the first publication of the poetry of [[Liu Xia (poet)|Liu Xia]], wife of the imprisoned Nobel Peace Prize recipient [[Liu Xiaobo]], in 2015.<ref>{{cite book |last=Liu |first=Xia |date=3 November 2015  |title=Empty Chairs: Selected Poems |publisher=Graywolf Press |isbn=978-1-55597-725-2 }}</ref> Müller also translated and read a few of Liu Xia poems in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://poetryeastwest.com/2016/04/28/herta-muller-translated-liu-xias-poems/ |title=Herta Müller translated Liu Xia's poems |date=28 April 2016  |website=Poetry East West |access-date=24 December 2017 }}</ref> On 4 December 2017, a photo of the letter to Herta Müller from Liu Xia in a form of poem was posted on Facebook by Chinese dissident [[Liao Yiwu]], where Liu Xia said that she was going mad in her solitary life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20171214-chinese-dissidents-widow-sends-desperate-letter |title=Chinese dissident's widow sends desperate letter |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=[[France 24]] English |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] | access-date=24 December 2017 }}</ref>
