'''Earl Wilbur Sutherland Jr.''' (November 19, 1915 – March 9, 1974) was an American pharmacologist and biochemist born in [[Burlingame, Kansas]]. Sutherland won a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1971 "for his discoveries concerning the mechanisms of the action of hormones", especially [[epinephrine]], via [[second messengers]], namely [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate]], or cyclic AMP.

==Early life==
Sutherland was born on November 19, 1915, in [[Burlingame, Kansas|Burlingame]], [[Kansas]]. The second youngest of six children, he was raised by his mother, Edith M. Hartshorn, and his father, Earl W. Sutherland.<ref name=bio13>Gale Group (2006). [http://www.bookrags.com/biography/earl-sutherland-wsd/ “World of Scientific Discovery on Earl Sutherland”]. World of Scientific Discovery.</ref> Though his father, who was originally from [[Wisconsin]], had attended [[Grinnell College]] for two years, he ultimately led an agrarian lifestyle that took him to both [[New Mexico]] and [[Oklahoma]] before settling down in [[Burlingame, Kansas|Burlingame]] to raise a family. Edith, a [[Missouri]] native, had some training in nursing at what was called a "ladies college". To provide for the family, Sutherland's father ran a dry goods store, where he gave each of his children working jobs. Sutherland began fishing at the age of five, and this became a pastime that he enjoyed for most of his life. As a high school student, Sutherland played and excelled in several sports, including [[tennis]], [[basketball]], and [[American football|football]].<ref name=bio6>[http://www.bookrags.com/biography/earl-sutherland-woc "Earl Sutherland Biography"]. BookRags.com</ref>

==Education==

In 1933, at the age of 17, Sutherland enrolled in [[Washburn College]], a school located in [[Topeka]], Kansas and began the pursuit of a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree.<ref name=bio13/> In order to pay for tuition, he worked throughout his undergraduate years as a medical staff assistant at a local hospital. Sutherland graduated in 1937, at the age of 21. He was then accepted to [[Washington University School of Medicine]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], where he developed a strong [[mentorship]] with [[Carl Ferdinand Cori]]. In 1942, Sutherland graduated with a [[Doctor of Medicine]].<ref name=bio13/>

==Professional experience and research==

In 1940, while studying at the Washington University School of Medicine, Sutherland had his first encounter with research as an assistant in [[pharmacology]] in the laboratory of Carl Ferdinand Cori, who won a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1947 for his discovery of the mechanism of [[glycogen]] metabolism.<ref name=bio12>Sutherland, Earl W (December 11, 1971).

Sutherland Jr. – Curriculum Vitae."] Nobelprize.org.</ref>

After receiving his medical degree from Washington University in 1942, Sutherland served as a [[World War II]] army physician. He returned to Washington University in 1945, where he continued to do research in Cori's Laboratory. Sutherland accredits his decision to pursue a research career, as opposed to entering the medical profession, to his mentor Cori.<ref name=bio12/>

Sutherland held various teaching titles during his time at the Washington University School of Medicine, including instructor in pharmacology (1945–46), instructor in [[biochemistry]] (1946–50), assistant professor in biochemistry (1950–52), and associate professor in biochemistry (1952–53).<ref name=bio3/>

In 1953, Sutherland moved to [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]] for a position as a professor of pharmacology and chairman of the department of pharmacology at the school of medicine at [[Case Western Reserve University]] (formerly, Western Reserve University). There, he collaborated with Theodore W. Rall, also a professor of pharmacology, who was to become a lifelong research partner. Together, they conducted further research on the mechanism of hormone action at the molecular level.<ref name=bio12/><ref name=bio3/> During his ten years at Case Western Reserve University, Sutherland made several ground-breaking discoveries that led to the identification of [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate]], or cyclic AMP, and its role as a [[secondary messenger]].

In 1963, Sutherland became professor of anatomy at [[Vanderbilt University School of Medicine]] in [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]].<ref name=bio6/> His position allowed him to devote more time to his research. He continued his work on cyclic AMP, receiving financial support from the Career Investigatorship awarded to him by the [[American Heart Association]] in 1967. He held his teaching title at [[Vanderbilt University]] until 1973.<ref name=bio3/>

==Discovery of cyclic AMP==

While working in Cori's laboratory, Sutherland, with the help of his co-workers, made several discoveries concerning the mechanism of [[glycogen]] [[metabolism]] that, years later, led him to his discovery of the biological activity of cyclic AMP. Cori's laboratory had previously established the basic mechanism of glycogen metabolism, for which they were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].<ref name=bio1/> Sutherland helped to identify the importance of [[Glycogen phosphorylase|liver phosphorylase]] (LP) in the process of [[glycogenolysis]]. Of the three basic [[enzymes]] involved in glycogenolysis, he found that LP was rate-limiting, meaning that the progression of glycogen metabolism is dependent on this enzyme.<ref name=bio12/> LP would become the subject of his research for the next several years, and it was through experimentation on LP and [[hormone]] interaction that his most renowned discovery was made.

After identifying the importance of LP, Sutherland moved his research efforts to Western Reserve University. There, he worked in collaboration with Ted Rall, Walter D Wosilait, and Jacques Berthet to publish a series of papers in the ''Journal of Biological Chemistry'' titled "The Relationship of Epinephrine and Glucagon to Liver Phosphorylase", in four parts.<ref name=bio14>{{cite journal|pmid=13278353|year=1956|last1=Sutherland|first1=E.

W|last3=Sutherland|first3=E. W|doi=10.1016/S0021-9258(18)65045-8|doi-access=free}}</ref> These four papers document the purification of LP and the analysis of several of its properties. First, it was determined that the enzymatic activity of LP depends on the addition or removal of a [[phosphate]] group, a process called [[phosphorylation]].<ref name="bio16" /> In a later experiment, they demonstrated that more phosphate is taken up in liver slices when epinephrine and glucagon are added, suggesting that these hormones were promoting the phosphorylation of LP, activating the enzyme.<ref name="bio16" /> The results of a later paper in the series suggested that this phosphorylation and activation of LP was a result of the action of phosphorlyase [[kinase]].<ref name=bio7/> This series also investigated the inactivation of liver phosphorylase and characterized an enzyme they initially called LP-inactivating enzyme, which functions by cleaving the phosphate group.<ref name =bio16/> This enzyme was later renamed liver phosphorylase phosphatase.<ref name=bio7/> These papers also characterized LP in terms of molecular weight and other factors. During their analysis, they found the unexpected result that LP activation increased with the addition of 5-AMP, which is a precursor of cAMP; however, this was not known at the time.<ref name=bio14/>

The fourth paper published in this series, entitled "The Relationship of Epinephrine and Glucagon to Liver Phosphorylase: IV Effect of Epinephrine and Glucagon on the Reactivation of Phosphorylase in Liver Homogenates",  came out in 1956 and was the most influential and groundbreaking of those released.  In this paper, Sutherland and associates furthered their investigation of epinephrine and glucagon. The key to the success of this experiment was the use a [[homogenate]] of liver cells rather than intact liver cells, as they had been doing in their previous experiments.<ref name=bio7/> The general consensus among researchers at that time was that the study of hormones was only possible using intact cells; this was the first instance that a hormone pathway was studied using a cell homogenate. Sutherland and his co-authors were able to observe similar effects in liver homogenate to what was observed in whole liver slices. More importantly, they were able to observe this response in two stages. This stage response was characterized by the particulate fraction producing an unknown heat stable factor in the presence of the hormones epinephrine and glucagon. This factor then stimulates the formation of liver phosphorylase in a fraction of the homogenate where the hormones are not present.<ref name=bio7/> This unknown heat stable factor, which was produced in the presence of hormones and ultimately led to the secondary formation of liver phosphorylase, was later termed cyclic AMP.<ref name=bio9>{{cite journal|doi=10.1161/01.CIR.37.2.279|title=Some Aspects of the Biological Role of Adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (Cyclic AMP)|journal=Circulation|volume=37|issue=2|pages=279|year=1968|last1=Sutherland|first1=E. W|last2=Robison|first2=G. A|last3=Butcher|first3=R. W|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=bio10>{{cite journal|pmid=4311899|year=1969|last1=Sutherland|first1=E. W|title=The role of cyclic AMP in the control of carbohydrate metabolism|journal=Diabetes|volume=18|issue=12|pages=797–819|last2=Robison|first2=G. A|doi=10.2337/diab.18.12.797|s2cid=7221384}}</ref>

Even though the discovery of cyclic AMP and the idea of [[second messengers]] were of great importance to the world of medicine, Sutherland's findings were actually achieved through strenuous trial and error. First of all, Sutherland and Ted Rall were convinced that a [[sucrose]] homogenate of liver cells was absolutely necessary in order to keep their cells healthy and proliferating.<ref name=bio8>{{cite journal|pmid=4320556|year=1970|last1=Sutherland|first1=E. W|title=On the biological role of cyclic AMP|journal=JAMA|volume=214|issue=7|pages=1281–8|doi=10.1001/jama.1970.03180070047009}}</ref> This inference was made by Rall from his experience studying [[mitochondria]], which responded well to these sucrose homogenates; however, it had nothing to do with what was being studied at the time. It turned out that this sucrose was not necessary for the homogenate and once they set up the experiment without sucrose they were able to see more effective results.  Secondly, Sutherland initially believed that there was something vital about the intact cell, and that disrupting its structure would not produce any hormonal effect.<ref name=bio8/> However, after some debate, Rall had convinced Sutherland to use liver homogenates. Once they had witnessed nearly a doubling of the rate of LP activation, they knew this belief in that keeping cells intact was crucial to studying the effects of hormones was not necessarily true, at least in this case. Finally, Sutherland had decided to ignore Jacques Berthet's request to conduct the same experiment using proper lab technique, specifically the Lehninger Hard Pour, where the supernatant material was decanted by pouring the liquid into another test tube once the particulate fraction reached the top of the original tube. Berthet not only demanded this step of the procedure be done through careful aspiration, he also critiqued the lack of specificity during centrifugation with respect to suspension height, rpm and time.<ref name=bio8/> The willingness of Sutherland and his associates to modify their experimental procedures and mistaken assumptions allowed them to make the discoveries that they made.

==Personal life==

Sutherland married Mildred Rice in 1937, the same year that he graduated from [[Washburn College]]. In 1944, during [[World War II]], Sutherland was called into service as a battalion surgeon under General George S. Patton, and was later sent to [[Germany]], where he served as a staff physician in a military hospital until 1945.<ref name=bio4>[http://calder.med.miami.edu/Sutherland/biography.htm "Earl W. Sutherland Jr. – Biography."] Louis Calder Memorial Library.</ref> He had two sons and a daughter with Mildred Rice.

In 1962, Sutherland divorced his first wife. A year later, when he became professor of physiology at [[Vanderbilt University]], Sutherland married Dr. Claudia Sebeste Smith, the assistant dean at the university and they were together for the remainder of Sutherland's life.<ref name=bio6/>
