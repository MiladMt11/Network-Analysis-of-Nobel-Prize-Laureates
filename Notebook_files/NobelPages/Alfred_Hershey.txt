'''Alfred Day Hershey''' (December 4, 1908 – May 22, 1997) was an American [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]]–winning [[bacteriologist]] and [[geneticist]].

He was born in [[Owosso, Michigan]] and received his B.S. in chemistry at [[Michigan State University]] in 1930 and his Ph.D. in [[bacteriology]] in 1934, taking a position shortly thereafter at the Department of Bacteriology at [[Washington University in St. Louis]].

He began performing experiments with [[bacteriophage]]s with Italian-American [[Salvador Luria]], German [[Max Delbrück]], and observed that when two different strains of bacteriophage have infected the same bacteria, the two [[virus]]es may exchange [[genetic information]].

He moved with his research partner [[Martha Chase]] to [[Laurel Hollow, New York]], in 1950 to join the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]]'s Department of Genetics, where he and Martha Chase performed the famous [[Hershey–Chase experiment]] in 1952.<ref>HERSHEY AD, CHASE M. Independent functions of viral protein and nucleic acid in growth of bacteriophage. J Gen Physiol. 1952 May;36(1):39-56. doi: 10.1085/jgp.36.1.39. PMID: 12981234; PMCID: PMC2147348.</ref> This experiment provided additional evidence that DNA, not protein, was the genetic material of life. Notable post-doctoral fellows in Hershey's lab include [[Anna Marie Skalka]].

He became director of the Carnegie Institution (which later became [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory]]) in 1962 and was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1969, shared with [[Salvador Luria]] and [[Max Delbrück]] for their discovery on the [[viral replication|replication of viruses]] and their genetic structure.

In 1981, Hershey became a founding member of the [[World Cultural Council]].<ref>{{cite web | title = About Us | publisher = [[World Cultural Council]] | url = http://www.consejoculturalmundial.org/about-us/ | access-date = November 8, 2016}}</ref>

Hershey had one child, Peter Manning Hershey (1956-1999) with his wife Harriet (often called Jill) (1918-2000).  The family was active in the social network of Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and regularly enjoyed the beach in season. Hershey was a [[Christians|Christian]].

After Hershey died, another phage worker, [[Franklin Stahl|Frank Stahl]], wrote: "The Phage Church, as we were sometimes called (see [[Phage group]]), was led by the Trinity of Delbrück, Luria, and Hershey. Delbrück's status as founder and his ''[[Papal infallibility#Ex cathedra|ex cathedra]]'' manner made him the pope, of course, and Luria was the hard-working, socially sensitive priest-confessor. And Al (Hershey) was the saint."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/readingroom/books/biomems/ahershey.html|title=Biographical Memoirs Home|first=National Academy of Sciences -|last=http://www.nasonline.org|website=www.nap.edu|access-date=April 9, 2018}}</ref>
