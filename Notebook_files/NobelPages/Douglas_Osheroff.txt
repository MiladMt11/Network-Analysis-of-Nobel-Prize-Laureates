'''Douglas Dean Osheroff''' (born August 1, 1945) is an American [[physicist]] known for his work in [[experimental physics|experimental]] [[condensed matter physics]], in particular for his co-discovery of [[superfluidity]] in [[Helium-3]]. For his contributions he shared the 1996 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] along with [[David Lee (physicist)|David Lee]] and [[Robert Coleman Richardson|Robert C. Richardson]].<ref>{{cite web | title = The Nobel Prize in Physics 1996 | publisher = Nobel Foundation | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1996/index.html| access-date = 2009-10-04}}</ref> Osheroff is currently the J. G. Jackson and C. J. Wood Professor of Physics, Emeritus at [[Stanford University]].

==Life and work==
Osheroff was born in [[Aberdeen, Washington]]. His father, William Osheroff, was the son of [[Jewish]] immigrants who left [[Russia]]. His mother, Bessie Anne (Ondov), a nurse, was the daughter of [[Slovaks|Slovak]] immigrants (her own father was a Lutheran minister).<ref name="NobelBio">[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1996/osheroff-autobio.html Biography on the Nobel Foundation website]</ref> Osheroff was [[Confirmation (Lutheran Church)|confirmed]] in the Lutheran Church but he was given the chance to choose and decided not to attend any longer. He has stated "In some sense it seemed that lying in church is the worst place to lie. I guess at some emotional level I accept the idea of God, but I don't know how God would manifest itself."<ref>Hargittai. 2006. ''Candid Science VI: More Conversations with Famous Scientists,'' Imperial College Press, p. 726</ref>

Osheroff earned his [[bachelor's degree]] in 1967 from [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], where he attended lectures by [[Richard Feynman]] and did undergraduate research for [[Gerry Neugebauer]].

Osheroff joined the [[Laboratory of Atomic and Solid State Physics]] at [[Cornell University]] as a graduate student, doing research in low-temperature physics.  Together with David Lee, the head of the laboratory, and Robert C. Richardson, Osheroff used a [[Pomeranchuk cooler|Pomeranchuk cell]] to investigate the behaviour of [[Helium-3|<sup>3</sup>He]] at temperatures within a few thousandths of a degree of absolute zero.  They discovered unexpected effects in their measurements, which they eventually explained as phase transitions to a superfluid phase of <sup>3</sup>He.<ref>{{cite journal

Osheroff received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from [[Cornell University]] in 1973. He then worked at [[Bell Labs]] in [[Murray Hill, New Jersey]] for 15 years, continuing to research low-temperature phenomena in <sup>3</sup>He.  In 1987 he moved to the Departments of Physics and Applied Physics at [[Stanford University]], where he also served as department chair from 1993-96.  His research is focused on phenomena that occur at extremely low temperatures.

Osheroff was selected to serve on the [[Columbia Accident Investigation Board|Space Shuttle ''Columbia'' investigation panel]], serving much the same role as Richard Feynman did on the [[Rogers Commission Report|Space Shuttle ''Challenger'' panel]].

He currently serves on the board of advisors of [[Scientists and Engineers for America]], an organization focused on promoting sound science in American government.

Osheroff is left-handed, and he often blames his slight quirks and eccentricities on it. He is also an avid photographer and introduces students at Stanford to medium-format film photography in a freshman seminar titled "Technical Aspects of Photography." In addition, he has taught the Stanford introductory physics course on [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]] on multiple occasions, most recently in Spring 2008, as well as undergraduate labs on low temperature physics.

Among his physics outreach activities, Osheroff participated in the [[USA Science and Engineering Festival|science festivals]] for middle and high school students, is an official guest of honor at the [[International Young Physicists' Tournament]] 2013.<ref>{{cite web | title = Douglas Osheroff at the IYPT 2013 | publisher = IYPT | url = https://twitter.com/iypt/status/314920472485695488| access-date = 2013-06-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Professor Douglas Osheroff: Invited Nobel laureate | publisher = iypt.tw | url = http://iypt.tw/iypt/index.php/iypt-2013/invited-nobel-laureate.html| access-date = 2013-06-02}}</ref>

He married a biochemist, Phyllis Liu-Osheroff, in 1970.

Osheroff is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President [[George W. Bush]] in May of 2008, urging him to "reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill" by requesting additional emergency funding for the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]’s [[Office of Science]], the [[National Science Foundation]], and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=A Letter from America's Physics Nobel Laureates|url=https://fire.pppl.gov/nobel_bush_fy08_050808.pdf}}</ref>
