==Early life==
Whipple was born to Ashley Cooper Whipple and Frances Anna Hoyt in [[Ashland, New Hampshire]].<ref name=":0" /> Ashley Cooper Whipple was a physician, and his father (George's paternal grandfather) was a physician and President of the New Hampshire Medical Society.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2">{{Cite book|url=https://www.nap.edu/read/4961/chapter/20#372|title=George Hoyt Whipple {{!}} Biographical Memoirs V.66|publisher=The National Academies Press|language=en|doi=10.17226/4961|year=1995|isbn=978-0-309-05237-5|last1=Miller|first1=Leon L.}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite journal|url=https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/571266|title=George Hoyt Whipple and his friends; The life story of a Nobel Prize pathologist|last=Corner|first=George W.|journal=Archives of Internal Medicine|publisher=Lippincott|year=1983|volume=115|issue=3|pages=363–364|location=Philadelphia|doi=10.1001/archinte.1965.03860150107025}}</ref> Whipple's father died from [[pneumonia]] or [[typhoid fever]] when George was just shy two years old.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /> His maternal grandfather also died when Whipple was two years old, and his paternal grandfather died a year later.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Whipple|first=George Hoyt|date=1959|title=Autobiographical Sketch|journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine|volume=2|issue=3|pages=253–289|doi=10.1353/pbm.1959.0003|pmid=13645198|s2cid=45464654|issn=1529-8795}}</ref> This left Whipple to be raised by his mother, Frances, and grandmother, Frances Moody Hoyt, who impressed on him the value of hard work and education.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":4" />

Whipple attended [[Phillips Academy|Andover]] prep school and began attending [[Yale University]] as an undergraduate in 1896, earning A.B. degree in 1900.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" /> During these years, he developed as an outdoorsman, an affinity he would hold lifelong.<ref name=":2" /> He wrote in his autobiography about growing up in a lake district, "I feel very fortunate that I grew up in the country...I became interested in wild life and camping, also hiking, snowshoeing, skating, bob sledding, canoeing, fishing, hunting—all this was an essential part of my life".<ref name=":4" /> He even credited his love for the outdoors as a contributor to his successes in work, study, and teaching.<ref name=":4" /> In the summers of prep school and undergrad, he worked at a drugstore and at [[Squam Lake]] and [[Lake Winnipesaukee]] in New Hampshire providing help and ferry services to the tourists and campers.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":4" /> Of his summer experiences, Whipple said, "I sometimes think I learned as much during the summer work periods as during the school terms."<ref name=":4" />

==Education==
As an undergraduate, he proved to be a prize-winning gymnast, oarsman, and an outstanding science student, exemplified by his election to membership in Sigma Xi and graduation with senior honors.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" /> The interactions Whipple had with biochemists [[Russell Henry Chittenden]] and [[Lafayette Mendel]] during his senior year at Yale left an indelible mark on his life and career.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|date=1976-02-21|title=Obituary notices|journal=British Medical Journal|volume=1|issue=6007|pages=468–470|issn=0007-1447|pmc=1638905|pmid=56205|last1=Whipple|first1=G. H.|doi=10.1136/bmj.1.6007.468}}</ref> In his autobiography, Whipple describes Mendel as "an unusual man who exerted a strong influence on me ... work with him was exciting and never to be forgotten".<ref name=":4" />

With a shortage of funds to finance further education, Whipple took a year off after graduating Yale. During this year, he worked at Dr. Holbrook Military School in [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining, New York]] teaching mathematics and science, and serving as an athletic coach.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":4" />

In 1901, under the advice, persuasion, and guidance of his mother, Whipple attended medical school at [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]].<ref name=":2" /> He received his M.D. degree in 1905.<ref name=":0" /> To gain experience and subsidize his medical school studies, Whipple applied for and was accepted to a teaching assistantship in John J. Abel's Department of Physiological Chemistry.<ref name=":2" /> Later, his performance in his first year anatomy course earned him a second-year appointment as a student instructor in anatomy.<ref name=":2" /> During this time, his interest in [[histology]] developed.<ref name=":2" /> Under the mentorship of William Welch, Eugene Opie, and William McCallum, Whipple was inspired to correlate clinical illness and disease, to the tissue findings discovered on autopsy.<ref name=":2" /> Together, McCallum and Welch conspired to offer Whipple a position as junior member of the pathology department with the hope it would lead to Whipple become a pediatric pathologist.<ref name=":2" /> Ultimately, Whipple accepted the position which shaped his career aspirations to become a pathologist.<ref name=":2" />

==Career==
In 1905, Whipple joined the pathology department at [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]] as an assistant in pathology.<ref name=":0" /> He was promoted successively to Assistant, Instructor, Associate and Associate Professor in pathology until he left in 1914.<ref name=":0" /> During this time, he spent a year in [[Panama]] at [[Ancon Hospital]] as a pathologist.<ref name=":0" />  In Panama, he worked with Samuel Darling, a resident pathologist, and General Gorgas to gain experience in tropical diseases.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":5" /> This experience afforded him the opportunity to study massive hemolysis associated with [[blackwater fever]].<ref name=":2" /> Before returning to [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]] after his time in Panama, Whipple traveled to Europe and spent time in the laboratories of Krehl and Morawitz in Heidelberg, where he learned about anemia in rabbits.<ref name=":2" /> In 1911, Whipple went to Vienna to study hepatic portal vein blood flow and its effects on hepatic functions in the dog with Hans Meyer.<ref name=":2" />

In 1914, at 34 years old, Whipple married Katherine Ball Waring of Charleston, South Carolina. They had two children.<ref name=":0" /> He was also appointed Professor of Research Medicine, and Director of the Hooper Foundation for Medical Research at the [[University of California]] [[UCSF Medical Center|San Francisco medical school]].<ref name=":0" /> He was dean of that medical school in 1920 and 1921.<ref name=":0" />

In 1921, through the persistence of [[University of Rochester]] President [[Benjamin Rush Rhees]], Whipple agreed to become a Professor and Chairman of Pathology, and the founding Dean of the yet-to-be-built [[University of Rochester Medical Center|medical school (URMC)]].<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=https://www.urmc.rochester.edu/pathology-labs/research-laboratories/george-whipple-lab/whipple.aspx|title=Who is George H. Whipple? – George H. Whipple Lab for Cancer Research – University of Rochester Medical Center|website=www.urmc.rochester.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-11}}</ref> Rhees was so determined to recruit Whipple, he personally flew to UC San Francisco to offer him the opportunity to build the medical school from the ground up.<ref name=":2" /> Whipple found this offer attractive because it would fulfil his passion to create a program which fostered an exchange between clinical and preclinical disciplines.<ref name=":2" /> His vision for the school included housing the medical school and hospital at the same site to facilitate this exchange.<ref name=":5" /> The first students entered [[University of Rochester Medical Center|URMC]] in 1925.<ref name=":5" />

==Retirement==
In 1953, at 75 years old, Whipple retired from the Deanship, and retirement from the University would follow in 1955.<ref name=":2" /> He was remembered as a superb teacher.<ref name=":6" /><ref>Autobiographical notes of Lauren V. Ackerman.

Whipple died in 1976 at the age of 97 and his ashes were scattered in Rochester's [[Mount Hope Cemetery, Rochester|Mount Hope Cemetery]].<ref name=":5" /><ref>{{Find a Grave|7938354|George Hoyt Whipple}}</ref> Though he was not related to [[Allen Whipple]], who described the [[Whipple procedure]] and [[Whipple's triad]], the two were lifelong friends.<ref>{{cite journal| doi=10.1016/S0016-5085(99)70485-3 | volume=117 | issue=3 | title=Whipple of Whipple's disease | year=1999 | journal=Gastroenterology | page=576 | last1 = Haubrich | first1 = William S.}}</ref> The Whipples also had a deep friendship with [[George Eastman]], founder of Rochester-based [[Eastman Kodak]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rbscp.lib.rochester.edu/3446|title=University of Rochester Library Bulletin: The Whipples and George Eastman {{!}} RBSCP|website=rbscp.lib.rochester.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-10-11}}</ref>

==Whipple's research==
Over the course of his career, Whipple authored or co-authored more than 300 publications.<ref name=":2" />

Whipple's research interests during his career primarily included [[anemia]] and the [[physiology]] and [[pathology]] of the [[liver]].<ref name=":0" /> But he also researched and made significant contributions to tuberculosis, pancreatitis, chloroform poisoning in animals, the metabolism of bile pigments and iron, the constituents of the bile, and the regeneration of plasma protein, protein metabolism, and the stroma of the [[red blood cell]]s.<ref name=":0" />

One of his first publications described the role of the lungs, lymphatic system, and gastrointestinal tract in the spread of tubercle bacillus causing tuberculosis.<ref name=":2" /> Another one of his early publications described autopsy results from a patient with an accumulation of fatty acids in the walls of the small intestine and lymph nodes.<ref name=":2" /> He named this abnormality lipodystrophia intestinalis (intestinal lipodystrophy),<ref name=":2" /> and correctly pointed to the [[bacteria]]l cause of the lipid deposits, resulting in the disease being named [[Whipple's disease]].<ref name=":5" />

When Whipple first joined [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]] as an assistant, he worked under [[William H. Welch]], focusing on the repair and regeneration of [[Hepatocyte|liver cells]].<ref name=":0" /> His research in dogs demonstrated that liver cells had an almost unlimited ability to regenerate.<ref name=":0" /> Through his chloroform liver injury studies, Whipple demonstrated that the liver was the site of [[fibrinogen]] synthesis.<ref name=":2" /> His research elucidated the route by which bile pigments enter circulation and produce jaundice in various parts of the body.<ref name=":0" /> 

Later, he studied [[bile pigments]] and their production outside the liver by way of bile fistulas at the Hooper Foundation at UC San Francisco.<ref name=":0" /> His interests soon extended to understanding the production of hemoglobin to gain a better understand of how it is metabolized into bile pigments.<ref name=":0" /> Co-authored with Hooper, Whipple published 12 papers, from 1915–1917, reporting the following:<ref name=":2" />
* Bile pigment bilirubin was a breakdown product of muscle hemoglobin, though red blood cell [[hemoglobin]] was the major normal source. 
* Bile pigment was not reabsorbed and reused in the production of new red blood cells. 
* The heme moiety of hemoglobin could be converted to bilirubin in both the pleural and peritoneal cavities, in addition to the liver.
* Normal liver function was essential for the excretion of bilirubin.
* The curve of red blood cell regeneration in anemia, as influenced by dietary factors, like sugar, amino acids and starvation.

At the University of Rochester, Whipple's research focus became studying the various factors in diets which contributed to recovery of long-term anemia, particularly in anemic dogs.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> Along with his research assistant, [[Frieda Robscheit-Robbins]] (formally Frieda Robbins), they co-authored 21 publications, from 1925–1930, reporting the following:<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" />
* Circulating plasma and hemoglobin volumes
* The effects of dietary and other factors on [[bile]] salt production and secretion
* Measurements of blood [[fibrinogen]]
* The effects of diet, [[Bleeding|hemorrhage]], liver injury, and other factors on plasma fibrinogen levels
* Blood regeneration following simple anemia
Whipple and Robscheit-Robbins were regarded as having one of the "great creative partnerships in medicine".<ref name=":5" />

In his landmark studies, published as a series "Blood Regeneration in Severe Anemia" beginning in 1925, Whipple demonstrated that raw liver fed to anemic dogs was the most effective diet additive for reversing the anemia by boosting the production of red blood cells.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> He would go on to show that foods derived from animal tissue, and cooked apricots also had a positive effect of increasing red blood cells during anemia.<ref name=":2" /> Based on these data, Whipple associated the iron content in these dietary factors to the potency of red blood cell regeneration.<ref name=":2" /> This data led directly to successful liver treatment of [[pernicious anemia]] by [[George Minot|George R. Minot]] and [[William P. Murphy]],<ref name=":6" /> despite the main therapeutic mechanism being through B12 rather than iron.<ref name=":5" /> This was a remarkable discovery since previously, pernicious anemia was invariably fatal at a young age.<ref name=":6" /> For his contribution to this body of work, he was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 1934 along with Minot and Murphy.<ref name=":0" />

In 1937, Whipple collaborated with William B. Hawkins to determine the life-span of the red blood cell in dogs.<ref name=":2" /> Simultaneously, with the advent of radioactive iron, Whipple, Paul F. Hahn, and William F. Bale collaborated to study iron absorption and utilization.<ref name=":2" /> They demonstrated that iron absorption was highly regulated in the small intestine and was influenced by the amount of iron stores in the body.<ref name=":2" /> They also demonstrated that insignificant amounts of iron were normally excreted or lost in the urine, feces, or bile.<ref name=":2" /> During this time, Whipple also formulated his theory on "the dynamic equilibrium between blood and tissue proteins" based on earlier plasmapheresis experiments he had performed (in the early 1930s) which demonstrated the importance of dietary protein on production of plasma proteins.<ref name=":2" /> This formed the foundation of research into mammalian protein metabolism, and led [[Rudolph Schoenheimer|Rudolf Schoenheimer]] to write ''The Dynamic State of the Body Constituents,'' marking the modern era of biochemistry and biology.<ref name=":2" />

Between 1939 and 1943 Leon L. Miller and Whipple collaborated to study the hepato-toxic effects of chloroform anesthesia on dogs.<ref name=":2" /> They found that dogs in a protein depleted state sustained lethal liver injury from within anesthesia fifteen minutes; but that feeding these depleted dogs a protein rich meal, particularly rich in L-methionine or L-cystine, prior to anesthesia was protective.<ref name=":2" /> This and other studies, led Whipple to the conclusion that S-containing amino acids are protective against liver against toxic agents.<ref name=":2" />

During World War II, Whipple tested combinations of dietary amino acids, administered, orally or parenterally, and their effects on plasma protein synthesis.<ref name=":2" /> He was able to characterize [[amino acid]] mixtures that could satisfy the metabolic requirements necessary to maintain weight, nitrogen balance, and plasma protein and hemoglobin regeneration in the dog.<ref name=":2" /> This would ultimately led to human clinical trials which demonstrated that these amino acid mixtures, along with enzymatic digest of casein, could sustain nourishment in patients who could not intake nutrients through the normal gastrointestinal route for extended periods.<ref name=":2" /> Intravenous nutrition, referred to as [[parenteral nutrition]], is routinely used today.<ref name=":2" />

== Nobel Prize, honors and distinctions ==
Whipple shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1934 with George R. Minot and William P. Murphy "for their discoveries concerning liver therapy in cases of anemia".<ref name=":1" />

In presenting the Nobel Prize, Professor I. Holmgren of the Nobel committee observed that "Of the three prize winners, it was Whipple who first occupied himself with the investigations for which the prize is now awarded. ... Whipple's experiments were planned exceedingly well, and carried out very accurately, and consequently their results can lay claim to absolute reliability. These investigations and results of Whipple's gave Minot and Murphy the idea that an experiment could be made to see whether favorable results might also be obtained in the case of [[pernicious anemia]]...by making use of the foods of the kind that Whipple had found to yield favorable results in his experiments regarding anemia from loss of blood."<ref name=":6" /><ref name="nobel">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1934/press.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1934: Presentation Speech|access-date=3 January 2010}}</ref>

Whipple received honorary doctorates from several American and international Universities, including the Universities of Athens and Glasgow.<ref name=":0" /> In 1930, along with Minot, he received the Popular Science Monthly Gold Medal and Annual Award.<ref name=":0" /> In 1934, he was awarded the William Wood Gerhard Gold Medal of the Pathological Society of Philadelphia.<ref name=":0" />

He also was a member of the following organizations:<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" />
