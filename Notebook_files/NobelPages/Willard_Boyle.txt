== Education ==
Boyle attended [[McGill University]], but his education was interrupted in 1943, when he joined the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] during [[World War II]].<ref name="big idea" /> He was loaned to the [[Royal Navy]], where he was learning how to land [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] on [[aircraft carrier]]s as the war ended.<ref name="big idea" /> He gained a [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] in 1947, an [[Master of Science|MSc]] in 1948, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree in 1950, all from McGill University.<ref name="McGill">

== Career ==
After receiving his doctorate, Boyle spent one year at Canada's Radiation Lab and two years teaching physics at the [[Royal Military College of Canada]].<ref name="big idea" />

=== Bell Labs ===
In 1953 Boyle joined [[Bell Labs]] where he invented the first continuously operating [[ruby laser]] with Don Nelson in 1962,<ref name="canpress">

=== Invention of charge-coupled device ===
In 1969, Boyle and [[George E.
