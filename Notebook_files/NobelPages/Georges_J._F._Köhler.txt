'''Georges Jean Franz Köhler''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʒɔʁʃ ˈkøːlɐ|-|De-Georges Köhler.ogg}}; April 17, 1946 in [[Munich]] – March 1, 1995 in [[Freiburg im Breisgau]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[biologist]].

Together with [[César Milstein]] and [[Niels Kaj Jerne]], Köhler won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1984, "for work on the [[immune system]] and the production of [[monoclonal antibodies]]". Milstein and Köhler's technique for producing monoclonal antibodies laid the foundation for the exploitation of antibodies for diagnostics, therapeutics and many other scientific applications.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Alkan|first=Sefik S.|date=July 2019|title=Legends of allergy/immunology: Georges Köhler and the discovery of MONOCLONAL antibodies|url=https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30920663|journal=Allergy|volume=74|issue=7|pages=1412–1414|doi=10.1111/all.13798|issn=1398-9995|pmid=30920663}}</ref>

==Career==

In April 1974 Köhler started a post-doctoral research fellowship at the [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]] in Cambridge, UK where he began working with [[César Milstein]] to develop a laboratory tool that could help them investigate the mechanism that underlies the diversity of antibodies. It was during this work that they devised their hybridoma technique for the production of antibodies. Köhler continued his collaboration on the technique when he returned to [[Basel Institute of Immunology]] in April 1974.<ref>[http://www.whatisbiotechnology.org/exhibitions/milstein/clinical The Story of César Milstein and Monoclonal Antibodies].</ref> Köhler remained at the Basel Institute for another nine years, during which time he continued investigating antibody diversity and in the early 1980s began working on the development of transgenic mice as a tool to understand the mechanism that underlies self-tolerance. In 1986 Köhler became director of the [[Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology and Epigenetics|Max Planck Institute of Immunobiology]] where he worked until his death in 1995.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.whatisbiotechnology.org/people/kohler|title=WhatisBiotechnology • the sciences, places and people that have created biotechnology}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-7643-7413-6_15|doi=10.1007/3-7643-7413-6_15|chapter=Köhler's death|title=Köhler's Invention|year=2005|pages=169–172|isbn=3-7643-7173-0}}</ref> He died as consequence of a heart condition. <ref>K.

==Personal life==

Kohler's father, Karl, was a German, while his mother, Raymonde, belonged to a French family. He married Claudia Reintjes in 1968. His first meeting with Claudia was held when he was doing university studies while Claudia was a physician's assistant. They had three children: Katharina, Lucia and Fabian. He not only worked hard for refining antibodies but also gave his time to his family. George moonlighted as a taxi driver to support his family. Most of the time he spent with his children while driving a small tractor on roads and enjoying roller-skating in streets <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whatisbiotechnology.org/|title=Professor Georges Kohler {{!}} Biographical summary|website=WhatisBiotechnology.org|language=en|access-date=2019-11-12}}</ref>
