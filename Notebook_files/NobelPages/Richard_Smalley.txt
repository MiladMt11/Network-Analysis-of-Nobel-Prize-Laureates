'''Richard Errett Smalley''' (June 6, 1943 – October 28, 2005) was the Gene and [[Norman Hackerman]] Professor of [[Chemistry]] and a Professor of [[Physics]] and [[Astronomy]] at [[Rice University]]. In 1996, along with [[Robert Curl]], also a professor of chemistry at Rice, and [[Harold Kroto]], a professor at the University of Sussex,  he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for the discovery of a new form of carbon, [[buckminsterfullerene]], also known as buckyballs. He was an advocate of nanotechnology and its applications.

==Early life and education==
Smalley, the youngest of 4 siblings, was born in [[Akron]], [[Ohio]] on June 6, 1943 to Frank Dudley Smalley, Jr., and Esther Virginia Rhoads.<ref name="Legacy.com">{{cite web|title=Dr. Richard Errett Smalley|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/houstonchronicle/obituary.aspx?n=richard-errett-smalley&pid=15564204|access-date=18 July 2016|website=Legacy.com}}</ref>  He grew up in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[Missouri]].<ref name="Feder">{{cite news|last1=Feder|first1=Barnaby J.|title=Richard E.

His father, Frank Dudley Smalley, Jr. worked with mechanical and electrical equipment and eventually became CEO of a trade journal for farm implements called ''Implement and Tractor''. His mother, Esther Rhoads Smalley, completed her B.A. Degree while Richard was a teenager. She was particularly inspired by mathematician Norman N. Royall Jr., who taught Foundations of Physical Science, and communicated her love of science to her son through long conversations and joint activities.  Smalley's maternal aunt, pioneering female chemist [[Sara Jane Rhoads]], interested Smalley in the field of chemistry, letting him work in her organic chemistry laboratory, and suggesting that he attend Hope College, which had a strong chemistry program.<ref name="NobelBio">{{cite web|title=Richard E.

Smalley attended [[Hope College]] for two years before transferring to the [[University of Michigan]] where he received his [[Bachelor of Science]] in 1965, performing undergraduate research in the laboratory of [[Raoul Kopelman]].<ref name=Hafner>{{cite journal|last=Hafner|first=Jason H.|title=Obituary: Richard Errett Smalley|journal=Physics Today|date=May 2006|volume=59|issue=5|pages=71–72|doi=10.1063/1.2216973|bibcode=2006PhT....59e..71H}}</ref> Between his studies, he also worked in industry, where he developed his unique managerial style. He received his Ph.D. from [[Princeton University]] in 1973 after completing a doctoral dissertation, titled "The lower electronic states of 1,3,5 (sym)-triazine", under the supervision of Elliot R. Bernstein.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Smalley|first=Richard Errett|url=https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/1639967|title=The lower electronic states of 1,3,5 (sym)-triazine|date=1974|language=en}}</ref>  He did postdoctoral work at the [[University of Chicago]] from 1973 to 1976, with [[Donald Levy]] and [[Lennard Wharton]] where he was a pioneer in the development of [[supersonic]] beam [[laser spectroscopy]].<ref name="Hargittai">{{cite book|last1=Hargittai|first1=István|last2=Hargittai|first2=Magdolna|title=Candid science|date=2000|publisher=Imperial College Press|location=London|isbn=978-1860941511|pages=363–373|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K_u3CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA363|access-date=18 July 2016}}</ref>

==Career==
In 1976, Smalley joined [[Rice University]].<ref name="Hargittai"/>  In 1982, he was appointed to the Gene and Norman Hackerman Chair in Chemistry at Rice. He helped to found the Rice Quantum Institute in 1979, serving as Chairman from 1986 to 1996. In 1990, he became also a Professor in the Department of Physics.  In 1990, he helped to found the Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology.  In 1996, he was appointed its Director.<ref name="Franklin">{{cite web|title=Richard E. Smalley|url=https://www.fi.edu/laureates/richard-e-smalley|website=Franklin Institute|access-date=19 July 2016|date=2014-01-15}}</ref>

He became a member of the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1990, and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1991.<ref name="Franklin"/>

===Fullerenes===
Smalley's research in [[physical chemistry]] investigated the formation of inorganic and semiconductor clusters using pulsed molecular beams and time-of-flight [[mass spectrometry]]. As a consequence of this expertise, Robert Curl introduced him to Harry Kroto in order to investigate a question about the constituents of [[Cosmic dust|astronomical dust]].  These are carbon-rich grains expelled by old stars such as [[R Coronae Borealis]]. The result of this collaboration was the discovery of C<sub>60</sub> (known as Buckyballs) and the fullerenes as the third [[allotropy|allotropic]] form of carbon.<ref>{{cite book |last=Edwards |first=Steven A.  |title=The Nanotech Pioneers: Where Are They Taking Us?  |location=Weinheim |publisher=Wiley-VCH |date=2006 |pages=64–66}}</ref>

The research that earned Kroto, Smalley and Curl the Nobel Prize mostly comprised three articles.  First was the discovery of C<sub>60</sub> in the Nov. 14, 1985, issue of ''Nature'', "C<sub>60</sub>: Buckminsterfullerene".<ref name="C60 publication">{{cite journal|last1=Kroto|first1=H.

Although only three people can be cited for a Nobel Prize, graduate students [[James R. Heath]], Yuan Liu, and [[Sean C. O'Brien]] participated in the work. Smalley mentioned Heath and O'Brien in his Nobel Lecture. Heath went on to become a professor at the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) and O'Brien joined [[Texas Instruments]] and is now at MEMtronics.  Yuan Liu is a Senior Staff Scientist at [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/549395/Richard-E-Smalley|title=Richard E. Smalley|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref>

This research is significant for the discovery of a new allotrope of carbon known as a [[fullerene]].  Other [[allotropes of carbon]] include [[graphite]], [[diamond]] and [[graphene]]. Harry Kroto's 1985 paper entitled "C60: Buckminsterfullerine", published with colleagues J. R. Heath, S. C. O'Brien, R. F. Curl, and R. E. Smalley, was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the [[American Chemical Society]], presented to Rice University in 2015.<ref name="Award"/><ref name="Breakthrough"/> The discovery of fullerenes was recognized in 2010 by the designation of a [[National Historic Chemical Landmarks|National Historic Chemical Landmark]] by the American Chemical Society at the Richard E. Smalley Institute for Nanoscale Science and Technology at Rice University in Houston, Texas.<ref name="ChemLandmark"/>

===Nanotechnology===
Following nearly a decade's worth of research into the formation of alternate fullerene compounds (e.g. C<sub>28</sub>, C<sub>70</sub>), as well as the synthesis of endohedral [[metallofullerenes]] (M@C<sub>60</sub>), reports of the identification of [[carbon nanotube]] structures led Smalley to begin investigating their iron-catalyzed synthesis.<ref name="Ghosh">{{cite book|last1=Ghosh|first1=Pallab|title=Colloid and interface science.|date=2009|publisher=Phi Learning|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-8120338579|page=410|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5j3jt06Fcs8C&pg=PA410}}</ref>

As a consequence of this research, Smalley was able to persuade the administration of Rice University, under then-president [[S. Malcolm Gillis|Malcolm Gillis]], to create Rice's Center for Nanoscale Science and Technology (CNST) focusing on any aspect of [[molecular nanotechnology]].<ref name="Death">{{cite news|last1=Boyd|first1=Jade|title=Nanotech pioneer, Nobel laureate Richard Smalley dead at 62|url=http://news.rice.edu/2005/10/28/nanotech-pioneer-nobel-laureate-richard-smalley-dead-at-62/|access-date=18 July 2016|work=Rice University News and Media|date=October 28, 2005}}</ref><ref name="Boyd">{{cite news|last1=Boyd|first1=Jade|title=Rice remembers Nobel laureate Richard Smalley|url=http://news.rice.edu/2005/11/03/rice-remembers-nobel-laureate-richard-smalley/|access-date=18 July 2016|work=Rice University News and Media|date=November 3, 2005}}</ref><ref name="Almond">{{cite news|last1=Almond|first1=B.

Smalley's latest research was focused on carbon nanotubes, specifically focusing on the [[chemical synthesis]] side of nanotube research. He is well known for his group's invention of the high-pressure [[carbon monoxide]] (HiPco) method of producing large batches of high-quality nanotubes.<ref name="Harris">{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Peter J.

===Dispute on molecular assemblers===
{{main|Drexler–Smalley debate on molecular nanotechnology}}

He was an outspoken [[Scientific scepticism|skeptic]] of the idea of [[molecular assembler]]s, as advocated by [[K. Eric Drexler]]. His main scientific objections, which he termed the "fat fingers problem" and the "sticky fingers problem", argued against the feasibility of molecular assemblers being able to precisely select and place individual atoms. He also believed that Drexler's speculations about [[Gray goo|apocalyptic dangers of molecular assemblers]] threatened the public support for development of nanotechnology.<ref name="Ford">{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=Martin|title=Rise of the Robots: Technology and the Threat of a Jobless Future|date=2015|publisher=Oneworld Publications|pages=240–241|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hB1fCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT168|isbn=9781780747507}}</ref>  He debated Drexler in an exchange of letters which were published in ''[[Chemical & Engineering News]]'' as a point-counterpoint feature.<ref name="Baum">{{cite journal|last1=Baum|first1=Rudy|title=Nanotechnology: Drexler and Smalley make the case for and against 'molecular assemblers'|journal=Chemical & Engineering News|date=December 1, 2003|volume=81|issue=48|pages=37–42|url=http://pubs.acs.org/cen/coverstory/8148/8148counterpoint.html|access-date=18 July 2016|doi=10.1021/cen-v081n048.p037}}</ref>

==Advocacy==
Starting in the late 1990s, Smalley advocated for the need for cheap, [[clean energy]], which he described as the number one problem facing humanity in the 21st century. He described what he called "The Terawatt Challenge", the need to develop a new power source capable of increasing "our energy output by a minimum factor of two, the generally agreed-upon number, certainly by the middle of the century, but preferably well before that."<ref name="Terawatt"/><ref name="Norris">{{cite news|last1=Norris|first1=Teryn|first2=Jesse|last2= Jenkins|work=The Huffington Post|title=Want to Save the World?

He also presented a list entitled "Top Ten Problems of Humanity for Next 50 Years".<ref name="Terawatt"/><ref>"Top Ten Problems of Humanity for Next 50 Years", Professor R. E. Smalley, Energy & NanoTechnology Conference, Rice University, May 3, 2003.</ref> It can be interesting to compare his list, in order of priority, to the [[Ten Threats]] formulated by the U.N.'s [[High Level Threat Panel]] in 2004. Smalley's list, in order of priority, was:
# Energy
# Water
# Food
# Environment
# Poverty
# Terrorism & war
# Disease
# Education
# Democracy
# Population<ref name="Terawatt"/>

Smalley regarded several problems as interlinked: the lack of people entering the fields of [[science]] and [[engineering]], the need for an alternative to [[fossil fuels]], and the need to address [[global warming]].<ref name="Terawatt">{{cite journal|last1=Smalley|first1=Richard E.|title=Future Global Energy Prosperity: The Terawatt Challenge|journal=MRS Bulletin|date=2005|volume=30|issue=JUNE|pages=412–417|url=http://cohesion.rice.edu/NaturalSciences/Smalley/emplibrary/120204%20MRS%20Boston.pdf|access-date=18 July 2016|doi=10.1557/mrs2005.124|doi-access=free}}</ref>  He felt that improved science education was essential, and strove to encourage young students to consider careers in science.
