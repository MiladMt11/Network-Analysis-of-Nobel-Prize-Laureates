==Early life and education==
Negishi was born in [[Changchun|Hsinking]] (today known as Changchun), the capital of [[Manchukuo]], in July 1935.<ref name="ryukyushimpo">{{Cite news

In November 1945, three months after [[World War II]] ended, they moved to Japan.<ref name=Times1/> Since he excelled as a student, a year ahead of what would have been his graduation from grammar school, he was admitted to an elite secondary school, Shonan High School.<ref name="auto">Chapman, Kit, ''[https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01828-9 Ei-ichi Negishi (1935–2021)]'', Nature, July 1, 2021</ref> At the age of 17, he gained admission to the University of Tokyo.

After obtaining his Ph.D., Negishi decided to become an academic researcher.<ref>（私の履歴書）根岸英一（10） 帝人に復帰 大学で「優」連発、自信に 新製品阻まれ学会へ転進、日本経済新聞、2012年10月10日</ref> Although he was hoping to work at a Japanese university, he could not find a position.<ref>[http://mainichi.jp/select/wadai/news/20101007k0000e040036000c.html ノーベル化学賞：根岸さんうっすら涙「来るものが来た」] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120719211712/mainichi.jp/select/wadai/news/20101007k0000e040036000c.html |date=July 19, 2012 }}、毎日新聞（電子版）、2010年10月7日</ref> In 1966 he resigned from Teijin, and became a postdoctoral associate at [[Purdue University]], working under future Nobel laureate [[Herbert C.

In 1972, he became an assistant professor at [[Syracuse University]], where began his lifelong study of transition metal–catalyzed reactions,<ref name="Shengming Ma Sciencemag"/> and was promoted to associate professor in 1979.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ei-ichi Negishi, Nobel Prize Winner in Chemistry and Former Faculty Member, Dies at 85 |url=https://news.syr.edu/blog/2021/06/25/ei-ichi-negishi-nobel-prize-winner-in-chemistry-and-former-faculty-member-dies-at-85/ |access-date=4 July 2021 |work=SU News |date=June 25, 2021}}</ref> He returned to Purdue University as a full professor in the same year.<ref>{{cite news |title=Syracuse University congratulates Ei-ichi Negishi on the 2010 Nobel Prize in chemistry |url=https://news.syr.edu/blog/2010/10/07/syracuse-university-congratulates-ei-ichi-negishi-on-the-2010-nobel-prize-for-chemistry/ |access-date=July 22, 2020 |work=SU News |date=October 7, 2010}}</ref>

He discovered [[Negishi coupling]], a process which condenses organic zinc compounds and organic halides under a [[palladium]] or [[nickel]] catalyst to obtain a C-C bonded product. For this achievement, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 2010.<ref name="sankei">{{Cite news

He did not seek a patent for this coupling technology and explained his reasoning as follows: "If we did not obtain a patent, we thought that everyone could use our results easily."<ref>{{cite news |title = 根岸・鈴木氏、特許取得せず…栄誉の道開く一因 |publisher = [[Yomiuri Shimbun]] |date = October 7, 2010 |url = http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/science/news/20101007-OYT1T00571.htm |access-date = October 8, 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101009103442/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/science/news/20101007-OYT1T00571.htm |archive-date = October 9, 2010 }}</ref>

By the time Negishi retired in 2019, he had published more than 400 academic papers.<ref name=Times1/> He was committed to instilling rigorous practices in his lab, emphasizing the need of keeping organized and comprehensive records. Before any separations, he asked his student to evaluate crude reaction mixtures in order to minimize loss of any useful scientific information.<ref name="Shengming Ma Sciencemag"/>

==Personal life and death==
Negishi began dating Sumire Suzuki in his freshman year and they announced their engagement to their parents in March 1958.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2010/negishi/biographical/|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2010|website=NobelPrize.org}}</ref> They had met at a choir of which they were both members at in university.<ref name=Times1/> They married the next year and together they had two daughters.<ref name=Disappearance/>

Negishi loved playing the piano and conducting. During the "Pacifichem" 2015 conference's closing ceremony, he conducted an orchestra.<ref name="Shengming Ma Sciencemag">{{cite journal |last1=Ma |first1=Shengming |title=Ei-ichi Negishi (1935–2021) |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=23 July 2021 |volume=373 |issue=6553 |pages=400–400 |doi=10.1126/science.abk0608 |url=https://science.sciencemag.org/content/373/6553/400 |access-date=31 July 2021 |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science|AAAS]] |language=en |issn=0036-8075|doi-access=free }}</ref>

===Disappearance===
On the evening of March 12, 2018, both Negishi and his wife were reported missing by family members. Police determined that, based on a purchase made earlier in the day, the couple had left their home in [[West Lafayette, Indiana]], and headed north. At about 5 a.m. the next day, officers in [[Ogle County, Illinois]], received a call to check on the welfare of an elderly man who was walking on a rural road south of [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]]. When he was taken to hospital, officers identified him as Negishi and found that police in Indiana were looking for him and his wife. A short time later, Suzuki's body was found at the Orchard Hills Landfill in [[Davis Junction, Illinois|Davis Junction]], along with the couple's car.<ref name="Disappearance">{{cite news |last1=Bangert |first1=Dave |title=Police: No foul play in death of wife of Purdue Nobel Prize winner found in Illinois |url=https://www.jconline.com/story/news/2018/03/13/wife-purdue-nobel-winner-found-dead-illinois-landfill-after-couple-reported-missing/422911002/ |access-date=July 22, 2020 |work=Journal and Courier |date=March 13, 2018}}</ref>

According to a statement from the family, the couple was driving to [[Rockford International Airport]] for a trip when their car became stuck in a ditch on a road near the landfill. Negishi went looking for help and was said to be suffering from an "acute state of confusion and shock". The Ogle County Sheriff Department said there was no suspicion of foul play in Suzuki's death, although the cause of her death was not immediately released. The family said Suzuki was near the end of her battle with [[Parkinson's disease]].<ref name=Disappearance/>

In May 2018, an autopsy concluded that Suzuki died from [[hypothermia]], but Parkinson's disease and [[hypertension]] were contributing factors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.jconline.com/story/news/local/purdue/2018/05/14/autopsy-hypothermia-complicated-parkinsons-killed-profs-wife/609019002/|title=Autopsy: Hypothermia, complicated by Parkinson's and hypertension killed professor's wife|first=Ron|last=Wilkins|website=Journal and Courier}}</ref>
