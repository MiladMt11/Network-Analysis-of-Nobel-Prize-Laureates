==Biography==
Vitaly Ginzburg was born to a [[Russian Jews|Jewish family]] in Moscow on 4 October 1916— the son of an engineer, Lazar Yefimovich Ginzburg, and a doctor, Augusta Wildauer who was a graduate from the Physics Faculty of [[Moscow State University]] in 1938. After attending his mother's alma mater, he defended his qualifications of the [[Kandidat Nauk|candidate's]] (''Kandidat Nauk'') dissertation in 1940, and his comprehensive thesis for the [[Doktor Nauk|doctor's]] (''Doktor Nauk'') qualification in 1942. In 1944, he became a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] of the Soviet Union. Among his achievements are a partially [[phenomenological model|phenomenological]] theory of [[superconductivity]], the [[Ginzburg–Landau theory]], developed with [[Lev Landau]] in 1950;<ref name="adsabs.harvard.edu">{{cite arxiv | title=Nonlinearities in Microwave Superconductivity | year=2012 | authors=Ledenyov, Dimitri O.; Ledenyov, Viktor O.| class=cond-mat.supr-con | eprint=1206.4426 }}</ref> the theory of [[electromagnetic wave]] propagation in [[plasma (physics)|plasmas]] (for example, in the [[ionosphere]]); and a theory of the origin of [[cosmic radiation]]. He is also known to biologists as being part of the group of scientists that helped bring down the reign of the politically connected anti-[[Gregor Mendel|Mendelian]] [[agronomy|agronomist]] [[Trofim Lysenko]], thus allowing modern [[genetics|genetic science]] to return to the [[Soviet Union|USSR]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Medvedev|first=Zhores|title=The Rise and Fall of T.D. Lysenko|url=https://archive.org/details/risefalloftdlyse008800|url-access=registration|location=New York|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=1969}}</ref>

In 1937, Ginzburg married Olga Zamsha. In 1946, he married his second wife, Nina Ginzburg (''nee'' Yermakova), who had spent more than a year in custody on fabricated charges of plotting to assassinate the Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rg.ru/2006/09/20/ginzburg.html|title=Виталий Гинзбург: с Ландау трудно было спорить — Юрий Медведев."Уравнение Гинзбурга – Ландау" — Российская Газета — Академику и нобелевскому лауреату Виталию Гинзбургу исполняется 90 лет. Накануне юбилея он рассказал в интервью "РГ", как стал физиком-теоретиком, будучи "плохим" математиком, и почему он брал расписки со своего друга и учителя – знаменитого Льва Ландау, с которым вместе работал над сверхпроводимостью. Именно за эту работу Гинзбург впоследствии получил Нобелевскую премию. "Общаясь с Ландау, я много думал о его феномене, о пределах возможностей человека, огромных резервах мозга", – признался он|website=Rg.ru|access-date=November 11, 2009}}</ref>

Ginzburg was the [[editor-in-chief]] of the [[scientific journal]] ''[[Uspekhi Fizicheskikh Nauk]]''.<ref name=ufn>{{cite web|url=http://ufn.ru/en/personal/vitaly_ginzburg.html|title=Vitaly Lazarevich Ginzburg — editor in chief of UFN}}</ref> He also headed the Academic Department of Physics and Astrophysics Problems, which Ginzburg founded at the [[Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology]] in 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fopf.fizteh.ru/department/astrofizika.html|title=About Academic Department of Physics and Astrophysics Problems|language=ru|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621145351/http://fopf.fizteh.ru/department/astrofizika.html|archive-date=21 June 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Ginzburg identified as a secular Jew, and following the [[collapse of communism]] in the former [[Soviet Union]], he was very active in Jewish life, especially in Russia, where he served on the board of directors of the [[Russian Jewish Congress]]. He is also well known for fighting anti-Semitism and supporting the state of [[Israel]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Vitaly Ginzburg|first=Avi|last=Hein|website=Jewish Virtual Library|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/vginzburg.html}}</ref>

In the 2000s (decade), Ginzburg was politically active, supporting the Russian liberal opposition and [[Human rights in Russia|human rights]] movement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universityworldnews.com/article.php?story=20071009143651311|title=Russia: Religious revival troubles Vitaly Ginzburg|publisher=University World News|access-date=November 11, 2009}}</ref> He defended [[Igor Sutyagin]] and [[Valentin Danilov]] against charges of espionage put forth by the authorities. On 2 April 2009, in an interview to the [[Radio Liberty]] Ginzburg denounced the [[Federal Security Service|FSB]] as an institution harmful to Russia and the ongoing expansion of its authority as a return to [[Stalinism]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Mikhail Sokolov|url=http://www.svobodanews.ru/articleprintview/1601170.html|title=2009 RFE/RL, Inc|website=Svobodanews.ru |access-date=November 11, 2009}}</ref>

Ginzburg worked at the [[Lebedev Physical Institute|P. N. Lebedev Physical Institute]] of [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Soviet and Russian Academy of Sciences]] in Moscow since 1940. [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] is a major institution where mostly all Nobel Prize laureates of physics from Russia have done their studies and/or research works.<ref>[[Russian Academy of Sciences#Nobel Prize laureates affiliated with the Academy|"Nobel Prize laureates affiliated with the Russian Academy of Sciences"]].</ref>

==Stance on religion==
Ginzburg was an avowed atheist, both under the militantly atheist Soviet government and in post-Communist Russia when religion made a strong revival.<ref>http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2003/ginzburg-autobio.html</ref> He criticized [[clericalism]] in the [[journalism|press]] and wrote several books devoted to the questions of [[religion]] and atheism.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Vitaly|last=Ginzburg|title=About atheism, religion and secular humanism|publisher=[[Lebedev Physical Institute|FIAN]]|location=Moscow|year=2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://gzt.ru/society/2007/08/13/220025.html|script-title=ru:Церковь ждет исповеди академиков|language=ru}}</ref> Because of this, some Orthodox Christian groups denounced him and said no science [[award]] could excuse his verbal attacks on the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://grani.ru/Society/Religion/m.125153.html|script-title=ru:Клирики против физика. Православные требуют привлечь к ответственности академика Гинзбурга|work=Grani.ru|date=July 24, 2007|language=ru}}</ref> He was one of the signers of the [[Open letter to the President Vladimir V. Putin from the Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences against clericalisation]] of Russia.

==Death==
A spokeswoman for the Russian Academy of Sciences announced that Ginzburg died in Moscow on 8 November 2009 from [[cardiac arrest]].<ref name=lat/><ref name=AFP>{{cite news|title=Russian bomb physicist Ginzburg dead at 93|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5go4kP_-j3KImd2MgzV-hT0UIy86w|first=Alexander|last=Osipovich|agency=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]|date=November 9, 2009|access-date=November 9, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413182755/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5go4kP_-j3KImd2MgzV-hT0UIy86w|archive-date=April 13, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> He had been suffering from ill health for several years,<ref name=AFP/> and three years before his death said "In general, I envy believers. I am 90, and [am] being overcome by illnesses. For believers, it is easier to deal with them and with life's other hardships. But what can be done? I cannot believe in resurrection after death."<ref name=AFP/>

Prime Minister of Russia [[Vladimir Putin]] sent his condolences to Ginzburg's family, saying "We bid farewell to an extraordinary personality whose outstanding talent, exceptional strength of character and firmness of convictions evoked true respect from his colleagues".<ref name=AFP/> [[President of Russia]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]], in his letter of condolences, described Ginzburg as a "top physicist of our time whose discoveries had a huge impact on the development of national and world science."<ref>{{cite news|title=Dmitry Medvedev sent his condolences to the family of Nobel Prize Winner Vitaly Ginzburg following the scientist's passing|url=http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/5942|date=November 9, 2009|publisher=President of Russia: Official Web Portal|access-date=July 16, 2016}}</ref>

Ginzburg was buried on 11 November in the [[Novodevichy Cemetery]] in Moscow, the resting place of many famous politicians, writers and scientists of Russia.<ref name=lat/>
