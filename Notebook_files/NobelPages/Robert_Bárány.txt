== Life and career ==
Bárány was born in [[Vienna]], [[Austria-Hungary]]. He was the eldest of six children of Maria (née Hock), the daughter of a scientist, and Ignác Bárány, born 1842 in [[Várpalota]], who was a bank official and estate manager.<ref name="Corporation1987">{{cite book|author=Visual Education Corporation|title=Nobel prize winners: an H.W.

Wilson|isbn=978-0-8242-0756-4|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/nobelprizewinner0000unse_k3o3}}</ref> His father was a [[Hungarian Jew]].

He attended medical school at [[Vienna University]], graduating in 1900. As a doctor in Vienna, Bárány was syringing fluid into the external auditory canal of a patient to relieve the patient's dizzy spells. The patient experienced [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] and [[Pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]] (involuntary eye movement) when Bárány injected fluid that was too cold. In response, Bárány warmed the fluid for the patient and the patient experienced nystagmus in the opposite direction. Bárány theorized that the [[endolymph]] was sinking when it was cool and rising when it was warm, and thus the direction of flow of the endolymph was providing the [[proprioception|proprioceptive]] signal to the vestibular organ. He followed up on this observation with a series of experiments on what he called the caloric reaction. The research resulting from his observations made surgical treatment of vestibular organ diseases possible. Bárány also investigated other aspects of equilibrium control, including the function of the [[cerebellum]]. [[Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo]] is said to have been first described in medical texts by Bárány.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Huppert |first1=Doreen |last2=Brandt |first2=Thomas |title=Dizziness and vertigo syndromes viewed with a historical eye |journal=Journal of Neurology |date=12 March 2018 |volume=265 |issue=S1 |pages=127–133 |doi=10.1007/s00415-018-8807-x|pmid=29532288 |s2cid=1303893 }}</ref>

He served in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] during [[World War I]] as a civilian surgeon and was captured by the [[Imperial Russian Army]]. When his [[Nobel Prize]] was awarded in 1914, Bárány was in a Russian [[prisoner of war]] camp. In response to his receiving the prize, [[Sigmund Freud]] wrote in 1915: "The granting of the [[Nobel Prize]] to Bárány, whom I refused to take as a pupil some years ago because he seemed to be too abnormal, has aroused sad thoughts about how helpless an individual is about gaining the respect of the crowd."<ref>{{cite book|author=[[Ernest Jones]] (Ed.)|title=[[The Life and Work of Sigmund Freud]]|chapter=23: The War Years|pages=347|date=1961|publisher=[[Basic Books]]}}</ref> Bárány was released from the [[prisoner of war]] camp in 1916 following diplomatic negotiations with Russia conducted by [[Prince Carl, Duke of Westrogothia|Prince Carl of Sweden]] and the [[Red Cross]]. He was then able to attend the Nobel Prize awards ceremony in 1916, where he was awarded his prize. Virtually as soon as he was awarded the Nobel Prize, in January 1917, he, with the automatic qualification for making such proposals that comes with being a Prize Winner, proposed to the Nobel Committee in Physiology or Medicine that Sigmund Freud should be awarded the Prize.<ref>Carl-Magnus Stolt (2002) "Why did Freud never receive the Nobel Prize?" in: Elisabeth Crawford (ed.) ''Historical Studies in the Nobel Archives. The Prizes in Science and Medicine'', Uppsala: Universal Academy Press. pp. 95–106</ref> From 1917 until his death he was professor at [[Uppsala University Faculty of Medicine]].

Bárány died shortly before his sixtieth birthday in Uppsala. He was the father of physician and [[Swedish Royal Academy of Sciences]] member [[Ernst Bárány]] (1910–1991) and grandfather of physicist [[Anders Bárány]], former secretary of the [[Nobel Committee for Physics]].
