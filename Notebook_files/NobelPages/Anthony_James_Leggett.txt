II|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WXtA3fhkDg|language=en|access-date=2021-08-13}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Leggett was born in [[Camberwell]], South London, and raised [[Catholic]].<ref name="biografia">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/2003/leggett-autobio.html|title=Anthony J. Leggett – Autobiography}}</ref> His father's forebears were village cobblers in a small village in Hampshire; Leggett's grandfather broke with this tradition to become a greengrocer; his father would relate how he used to ride with him to buy vegetables at the [[Covent Garden]] market in London. His mother's parents were of Irish descent; her father had moved to Britain and worked as a clerk in the [[Chatham Dockyard|naval dockyard in Chatham]].<ref name="biografia"/> His maternal grandmother, who survived into her eighties, was sent out to [[domestic service]] at the age of twelve. She eventually married his grandfather and raised a large family, then in her late sixties emigrated to Australia to join her daughter and son-in-law, and finally returned to the UK for her last years.

His father and mother were each the first in their families to receive a university education; they met and became engaged while students at the Institute of Education at the [[University of London]], but were unable to get married for some years because his father had to care for his own mother and siblings. His father worked as a secondary school teacher of [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[mathematics]]. His mother also taught secondary school mathematics for a time, but had to give this up when he was born. He was eventually followed by two sisters, Clare and Judith, and two brothers, Terence and Paul, all raised in their parents' [[Roman Catholic]] faith. Leggett ceased to be a practising [[Catholic]] in his early twenties.<ref name="biografia"/>

Soon after he was born, his parents bought a house in [[Upper Norwood]], south London. When he was 18 months old, WWII broke out and he was evacuated to [[Englefield Green]], a small village in [[Surrey]] on the edge of the great park of [[Windsor Castle]], where he stayed for the duration of the war. After the end of the war, he returned to the Upper Norwood house and lived there until 1950; his father taught at a school in north-east London and his mother looked after the five children full-time. He attended the local Catholic primary school, and later, following a successful performance in the [[eleven-plus exam|11-plus]], which he took rather earlier than most, and then transferred to [[Wimbledon College]]. {{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

He later attended Beaumont College, a Jesuit school in Old Windsor. He and his two younger brothers, Terrence and Paul, attended Beaumont as a consequence of his father's appointment to teach science at the college. While there, Leggett primarily studied classics, since that was generally regarded as the most prestigious field at the time; this study led directly to his Greats degree while at Oxford. Despite Leggett's emphasis on classics at Beaumont, his father ran an evening 'science club' for his younger son and a couple of others.  In his last year at Beaumont, Leggett won every single prize for the subjects that he studied that year.

Leggett won a scholarship to [[Balliol College, Oxford]], in December 1954 and entered the University the following year with the intention of reading the degree technically known as [[Literae Humaniores]] (classics). After completing his first degree he began a second undergraduate degree, this time in physics at [[Merton College, Oxford]].<ref name="MCreg">{{cite book|editor1-last=Levens|editor1-first=R.G.C.|title=Merton College Register 1900–1964|date=1964|publisher=Basil Blackwell|location=Oxford|page=511}}</ref> One person who was willing to overlook Leggett's unorthodox credentials was [[Dirk ter Haar]], then a reader in theoretical physics and a fellow of [[Magdalen College, Oxford]]; so Leggett signed up for research under ter Haar's supervision. As with all of ter Haar's students in that period, the tentatively assigned thesis topic was ''"Some Problems in the Theory of Many-Body Systems"'', which left a considerable degree of latitude.

Dirk took a great interest in the personal welfare of his students and their families, and was meticulous in making sure they received adequate support; indeed, he encouraged Leggett to apply for a Prize Fellowship at Magdalen, which he held from 1963 to 1967. In the end Leggett's thesis consisted of studies of two somewhat disconnected problems in the general area of liquid [[helium]], one on higher-order [[phonon]] interaction processes in [[superfluid]] <sup>4</sup>He and the other on the properties of dilute solutions of <sup>4</sup>He in normal liquid <sup>3</sup>He (a system which unfortunately turned out to be much less experimentally accessible than the other side of the phase diagram, dilute solutions of <sup>3</sup>He in <sup>4</sup>He). The [[University of Oxford]] awarded Leggett an [[Honorary degree|Honorary DLitt]] in June 2005.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

==Career ==
Leggett spent the period August 1964 – August 1965 as a [[postdoctoral research]] fellow at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] (UIUC), and [[David Pines]] and his colleagues ([[John Bardeen]], [[Gordon Baym]], [[Leo Kadanoff]] and others) provided a fertile environment.
He then spent a year in the group of Professor Takeo Matsubara at [[Kyoto University]] in Japan.

After one more postdoctoral year which he spent in "roving" mode, spending time at Oxford, Harvard, and Illinois, in the autumn of 1967 he took up a lectureship at the [[University of Sussex]], where he was to spend the majority of the next fifteen years of his career. During the mid 1970s, he spent considerable time in Japan at the [[University of Tokyo]] and also at [[Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology]] in Kumasi, Ghana.

In early 1982 he accepted an offer from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] (UIUC) of the MacArthur Chair with which the university had recently been endowed. As he had already committed himself to an eight-month stay as a visiting scientist at Cornell in early 1983,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.bnl.gov/energy/ces/cv/leggett.asp | title=Energy Programs &#124; Principal Investigators}}</ref> he finally arrived in Urbana in the early fall of that year, and has been there ever since.

Leggett's own research interests shifted away from superfluid <sup>3</sup>He since around 1980; he worked inter alia on the low-temperature properties of glasses, high-temperature superconductivity, the [[Bose–Einstein condensate|Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC)]] atomic gases and above all on the theory of experiments to test whether the formation of quantum mechanics will continue to describe the physical world as we push it up from the atomic level towards that of everyday life.

From 2006 to 2016, he also held a position at the [[Institute for Quantum Computing]] in Waterloo, Canada.

He currently{{when|date=August 2015}} serves as the chief scientist at the [[Institute for Condensed Matter Theory]], a research institute hosted by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

In 2013, he became the founding Director of the Shanghai Center for Complex Physics.<ref>http://sccp.physics.sjtu.edu.cn/Info.php?pnum=2&num=105</ref>

==Research ==
His research focuses on cuprate [[superconductivity]], [[superfluidity]] in highly degenerate [[atomic gases]], low temperature properties of [[amorphous solids]], conceptual issues in the formulation of [[quantum mechanics]] and [[topological quantum computation]].

The edition of 29 December 2005 of the ''[[International Herald Tribune]]'' printed an article, "New tests of Einstein's 'spooky' reality", which referred to Leggett's Autumn 2005 debate at a conference in [[Berkeley, California]], with fellow Nobel laureate [[Norman Ramsey]] of [[Harvard University]].<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/28/health/28iht-sneinstein.html "New tests of Einstein's 'spooky' reality"]</ref> Both debated the worth of attempts to change quantum theory. Leggett thought attempts were justified, Ramsey opposed. Leggett believes quantum mechanics may be incomplete because of the [[Measurement problem|quantum measurement problem]].

==Awards and honours==
Leggett is a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], the [[American Philosophical Society]], the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] (foreign member), the [[Indian National Science Academy]], and was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1980|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1980]],<ref name=frs/> the [[American Physical Society]], and [[American Institute of Physics]], and Life Fellow of the [[Institute of Physics]].

He was awarded the 2003 Nobel Prize in Physics (with [[Vitaly Ginzburg|V. L. Ginzburg]] and [[Alexei Alexeyevich Abrikosov|A. A. Abrikosov]]) for pioneering contributions to the theory of superconductors and superfluids. He is an Honorary Fellow of the [[Institute of Physics]] (UK). He was appointed [[Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] (KBE) in the [[2004 Birthday Honours|2004]] [[Queen's Birthday Honours]] "for services to physics".<ref name="LG 12 June 2004">{{London Gazette |issue=57315 |date=12 June 2004 |page=23 |supp=y }}</ref> He also won the 2002/2003 [[Wolf Prize|Wolf Foundation Prize]] for research on condensed forms of matter (with [[Bertrand Halperin|B. I. Halperin]]). He was also honoured with the Eugene Feenberg Memorial Medal (1999). He has been elected as a Foreign Fellow of the Indian National Science Academy (2011).

==Personal life==
In June 1973 he married Haruko Kinase. They met at Sussex University, in Brighton, England. In 1978, they had a daughter Asako.<ref name="biografia"/> His wife Haruko earned a PhD{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} in cultural anthropology from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] and is currently{{when|date=August 2015}} doing research on the hospice system.<ref name="biografia"/> Their daughter, Asako, also graduated from UIUC, with a joint major in geography and chemistry.  She holds dual US/UK citizenship.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}
