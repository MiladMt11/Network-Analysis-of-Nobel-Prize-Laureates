{{nihongo|'''Ryōji Noyori'''|野依 良治|Noyori Ryōji|born September 3, 1938}} is a [[Japan]]ese [[chemist]]. He won the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 2001, Noyori shared a half of the prize with [[William S. Knowles]] for the study of [[Asymmetric hydrogenation|chirally catalyzed hydrogenations]]; the second half of the prize went to [[K. Barry Sharpless]] for his study in chirally catalyzed oxidation reactions ([[Sharpless epoxidation]]).<ref>''Organic synthesis in Japan : past, present, and future : in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the Society of Synthetic Organic Chemistry, Japan'' / editor in chief, Ryoji Noyori (1992)</ref><ref>''Asymmetric catalysis in organic synthesis'' (1994)</ref><ref>[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/matthey/pmr/2002/00000046/00000002/art00011 T.

==Education and career==
Ryōji Noyori was born in [[Kobe|Kobe, Japan]]. Early in his school days Ryoji was interested in physics. His interest was kindled by the famous physicist [[Hideki Yukawa]] (1949 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] winner), a close friend of his father. Later, he became fascinated with chemistry, after hearing a presentation on [[nylon]] at an industrial exposition.  He saw the power of chemistry as being the ability to "produce high value from almost nothing".  He was a student at the School of Engineering (Department of Industrial Chemistry) of the [[Kyoto University]], where he graduated in 1961. He subsequently obtained a [[Master's degree]] in [[Industrial Chemistry]] from the Graduate School of Engineering of the [[Kyoto University]]. Between 1963 and 1967, he was a Research Associate at the School of Engineering of the [[Kyoto University]], and an instructor in the research group of [[Hitoshi Nozaki]]. Noyori obtained a [[Doctor of Engineering]] degree (DEng) from the [[Kyoto University]] in 1967.<ref>[http://en.nagoya-u.ac.jp/people/nobel/ryoji_noyori/index.html Ryoji Noyori] - website Nagoya University</ref> He became an associate professor at the same university in 1968. After postdoctoral work with [[Elias J. Corey]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] he returned to Nagoya, becoming a full professor in 1972.  He is still based at Nagoya, and served as president of [[RIKEN]], a multi-site national research initiative with an annual budget of $800 million, from 2003 to 2015.<ref>RIKEN News March 24, 2015 [http://www.riken.jp/en/pr/topics/2015/20150324_1/], Nature News March 24, 2015 [http://www.nature.com/news/president-of-japan-s-riken-research-labs-resigns-1.17180]</ref>

Noyori believes strongly in the power of [[catalysis]] and of [[green chemistry]]; in a 2005 article he argued for the pursuit of "practical elegance in synthesis".<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/B502713F|pmid=15795753|title=Pursuing practical elegance in chemical synthesis|year=2005|last1=Noyori|first1=Ryoji|journal=Chemical Communications|issue=14|pages=1807–11 }}</ref> In this article he stated that "''our ability to devise straightforward and practical chemical syntheses is indispensable to the survival of our species.''"  Elsewhere he has said that "''Research is for nations and mankind, not for researchers themselves.''"  He encourages scientists to be politically active: "''Researchers must spur public opinions and government policies toward constructing the [[sustainable development|sustainable society]] in the 21st century.''"<ref>Keynote address, June 23, 2005, at the ''Second International Conference on Green and Sustainable Chemistry'', Washington DC.</ref>

Noyori is currently a chairman of the Education Rebuilding Council, which was set up by Japan's PM [[Shinzō Abe]] after he came to power in 2006.<ref>[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070120a1.htm Abe panel wants kids in class more, plus harsher discipline | The Japan Times Online]. Search.japantimes.co.jp (January 20, 2007). Retrieved on 2011-06-27.</ref>

Noyori is most famous for [[asymmetric hydrogenation]] using as [[catalyst]]s [[Complex (chemistry)|complexes]] of [[rhodium]] and [[ruthenium]], particularly those based on the [[BINAP]] [[ligand]]. (See [[Noyori asymmetric hydrogenation]])  Asymmetric [[hydrogenation]] of an [[alkene]] in the presence of ((''S'')-[[BINAP]])Ru([[Acetate|OAc]])<sub>2</sub> is used for the commercial production of enantiomerically pure (97% [[Enantiomeric excess|ee]]) [[naproxen]], used as an [[anti-inflammatory]] drug.  The [[antibacterial]] agent [[levofloxacin]] is manufactured by asymmetric [[hydrogenation]] of [[ketone]]s in the presence of a Ru(II) BINAP halide complex.

He has also worked on other [[asymmetric synthesis|asymmetric processes]]. Each year 3000 [[tonnes]] (after new expansion) of [[menthol]] are produced (in 94% [[Enantiomeric excess|ee]]) by [[Takasago International Corporation]], using Noyori's method for [[isomerisation]] of [[allyl]]ic [[amine]]s.<ref>[http://www.flex-news-food.com/console/PageViewer.aspx?page=13467 Japan: Takasago to Expand L-Menthol Production in Iwata Plant].

More recently with Philip G. Jessop, Noyori has developed an industrial process for the manufacture of ''N,N''-[[dimethylformamide]] from [[hydrogen]], [[dimethylamine]] and [[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]] [[carbon dioxide]] in the presence of  {{chem2|RuCl2(P(CH3)3)4}} as catalyst.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Walter Leitner|author2=Philip G.
