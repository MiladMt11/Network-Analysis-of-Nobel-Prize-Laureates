'''Nikolay Gennadiyevich Basov''' ({{lang-ru|Никола́й Генна́диевич Ба́сов}}; 14 December 1922 – 1 July 2001) was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[physicist]] and educator. For his fundamental work in the field of [[quantum electronics]] that led to the development of [[laser]] and [[maser]], Basov shared the 1964 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] with [[Alexander Prokhorov]] and [[Charles Hard Townes]].<ref name=i-lasers>[http://i-lasers.com/basov.html "Basov Nikolay Gennadiyevich"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926022159/http://i-lasers.com/basov.html |date=26 September 2010 }}</ref>

==Early life==
Basov was born in the town [[Usman (town)|Usman]], now in [[Lipetsk Oblast]] in 1922.<ref name=AC /> He finished school in 1941 in [[Voronezh]], and was later called for military service at [[Kuibyshev Military Medical Academy]]. In 1943 he left the academy and served in the [[Red Army]]<ref name=AC /> participating in the [[Second World War]] with the [[1st Ukrainian Front]].

==Professional career==
Basov graduated from [[Moscow Engineering Physics Institute]] (MEPhI) in 1950. He then held a professorship at MEPhI and also worked in the [[Lebedev Physical Institute]] (LPI), where he defended a dissertation for the ''[[Candidate of Sciences]]'' degree (equivalent to [[PhD]]) in 1953 and a dissertation for the ''[[Doctor of Sciences]]'' degree in 1956. Basov was the Director of the LPI in 1973–1988. He was elected as  [[corresponding member]] of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]] ([[Russian Academy of Sciences]] since 1991) in 1962 and  [[academician|Full Member]] of the Academy in 1966.<ref name=brit/> In 1967, he was elected a Member of the Presidium of the Academy (1967—1990), and since 1990 he was the councillor of the Presidium of the USSR Academy of Sciences. In 1971 he was elected a Member of the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]].<ref>[http://www.leopoldina.org/en/members/list-of-members/member/1815/ List of Members]. Leopoldina.org. Retrieved on 30 July 2020.</ref> He was Honorary President and Member of the [[International Academy of Science, Munich]].<ref>International Academy of Science (1989) [http://www.ias-icsd.org/resources/ICSD-IAS-Founding-Members-1989.pdf Selection of IAS-ICSD Founding Members]. </ref><ref>[http://www.ias-icsd.org/history.html History – International Academy of Science, Munich]. Ias-icsd.org. Retrieved on 30 July 2020.</ref> He was the head of the laboratory of quantum radiophysics at the LPI until his death in 2001.<ref name=i-lasers/>

In the early 1950s Basov and Prokhorov developed theoretical grounds for creation of a molecular oscillator and constructed such an oscillator based on [[ammonia]]. Later this oscillator became known as [[maser]]. They also proposed a method for the production of [[population inversion]] using inhomogeneous electric and magnetic fields. Their results were presented at a national conference in 1952 and published in 1954. Basov then proceeded to the development of laser, an analogous generator of coherent light. In 1955 he designed a [[three-level laser]], and in 1959 suggested constructing a [[semiconductor laser]], which he built with collaborators in 1963.<ref name=brit/>

Basov's contributions to the development of the laser and maser, which won him the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1964, also led to new missile defense initiatives.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=fnqN-1UaNI4C "Soviet ballistic missile defense and the Western alliance"], David Scott Yost. Harvard University Press, 1988. {{ISBN|0-674-82610-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-674-82610-6}}. p. 58</ref>

==Politics==
He entered politics in 1951{{clarify|date=December 2012}} and became a member of parliament (the [[Soviet of the Union]] of the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]]) in 1974.<ref name=AC>[https://books.google.com/books?id=3-G3vi5av28C "A century of Nobel Prizes recipients: chemistry, physics, and medicine"], Francis Leroy.
