==Biography==
Tomonaga was born in [[Tokyo]] in 1906. He was the second child and eldest son of a Japanese [[philosopher]], [[Tomonaga Sanjūrō]]. He entered the [[Kyoto University|Kyoto Imperial University]] in 1926. [[Hideki Yukawa]], also a [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel laureate]], was one of his classmates during [[undergraduate]] school. During graduate school at the same university, he worked as an assistant in the university for three years. In 1931, after graduate school, he joined [[Yoshio Nishina|Nishina]]'s group in [[RIKEN]]. In 1937, while working at [[Leipzig University]] ([[Leipzig, Germany|Leipzig]]), he collaborated with the research group of [[Werner Heisenberg]]. Two years later, he returned to Japan due to the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], but finished his doctoral degree (Dissertation PhD from [[University of Tokyo]]) on the study of [[Nuclear physics|nuclear]] materials with his thesis on work he had done while in Leipzig.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/tomonaga-bio.html|title=Sin-Itiro Tomonaga - Biographical|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2018-01-03}}</ref> 

In Japan, he was appointed to a professorship in the Tokyo University of Education (a forerunner of [[Tsukuba University]]). During the war he studied the [[magnetron]], [[meson]] theory, and his [[super-many-time theory]]. In 1948, he and his students re-examined a 1939 paper by [[Sidney Dancoff]] that attempted, but failed, to show that the infinite quantities that arise in [[Quantum electrodynamics|QED]] can be canceled with each other. Tomonaga applied his super-many-time theory and a relativistic method based on the non-relativistic method of [[Wolfgang Pauli]] and [[Markus Fierz|Fierz]] to greatly speed up and clarify the calculations.  Then he and his students found that Dancoff had overlooked one term in the [[perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)|perturbation series]].  With this term, the theory gave finite results; thus Tomonaga discovered the [[renormalization]] method independently of [[Julian Schwinger]] and calculated physical quantities such as the [[Lamb shift]] at the same time.

In 1949,<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1965/tomonaga-bio.html|title=Sin-Itiro Tomonaga - Biographical|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=2018-01-03}}</ref>  he was invited by [[Robert Oppenheimer]] to work at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]]. He studied a [[many-body problem]] on the collective oscillations of a quantum-mechanical system. In the following year, he returned to Japan and proposed the [[Tomonaga–Luttinger liquid]]. In 1955, he took the leadership in establishing the Institute for Nuclear Study, [[University of Tokyo]].<ref name=":0" /> In 1965, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], with [[Julian Schwinger]] and [[Richard P. Feynman]], for the study of QED, specifically for the discovery of the [[renormalization]] method. He died of throat cancer in [[Tokyo]] in 1979.

Tomonaga was married in 1940 to Ryōko Sekiguchi. They had two sons and one daughter. He was awarded the Order of Culture in 1952, and the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun in 1976.

In recognition of three [[Nobel laureates]]' contributions, the bronze statues of Shin'ichirō Tomonaga, [[Leo Esaki]], and [[Makoto Kobayashi (physicist)|Makoto Kobayashi]] was set up in the Central Park of Azuma 2 in [[Tsukuba City]] in 2015.<ref>[http://mainichi.jp/feature/news/m20150316ddlk08040111000c.html ノーベル賞:江崎、小林、朝永氏の銅像やレリーフ設置　完成記念式でお披露目　「子どもが夢を」−−つくば・中央公園　／茨城 - 毎日新聞] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424074404/http://mainichi.jp/feature/news/m20150316ddlk08040111000c.html |date=2015-04-24 }}</ref>
