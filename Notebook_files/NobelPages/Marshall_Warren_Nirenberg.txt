==Biography==
Nirenberg was born in New York City to a [[Jewish]] family, the son of Minerva (Bykowsky) and Harry Edward Nirenberg, a shirtmaker.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/marshall-warren-nirenberg-wob/|title=Marshall Warren Nirenberg Biography|website=www.bookrags.com|access-date=18 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/marshall-nirenberg|title=Marshall Nirenberg|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org|language=en|access-date=2018-01-09}}</ref> He developed [[rheumatic fever]] as a boy, so the family moved to [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], Florida to take advantage of the [[subtropical climate]]. He developed an early interest in [[biology]]. In 1948 he received his [[B.S. degree]], and in 1952, a [[master's degree]] in [[zoology]] from the [[University of Florida]] at Gainesville where he was also a member of the [[Pi Lambda Phi]] [[Fraternity]].<ref name="2010directory">Membership Directory, 2010, Pi Lambda Phi Inc.</ref> His [[dissertation]] for the [[Master's thesis]] was an [[ecological]] and [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] study of [[caddis flies]] ([[Trichoptera]]).  He received his [[Ph.D.]] in [[biochemistry]] from the [[University of Michigan]], [[Ann Arbor]] in 1957, studying hexose uptake in tumor cells with his advisor James F. Hogg.<ref name="Fee_Biography">{{cite web |last= Fee |first=E. |title=Profiles in Science: The Marshall W. Nirenberg Papers.

He began his [[postdoctoral]] work at the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) in 1957 as a fellow of the [[American Cancer Society]] in what was then called the [[National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases]]. In 1959 he became a research biochemist at the [[NIH]] and began to study the steps that relate [[DNA]], [[RNA]] and [[protein]]. Nirenberg's groundbreaking experiments advanced him to become the head of the Section of Biochemical Genetics in 1962 in the [[National Heart Institute]] (now the [[National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute]]), where he remained a laboratory chief until his death. Fellow laboratory chiefs included [[Ernst Freese]] and [[Daniel Carleton Gajdusek]].  He was married in 1961 to [[Perola Zaltzman]], a [[chemist]] from the [[University of Brazil, Rio de Janeiro]], who also worked at [[NIH]] and died in 2001. Nirenberg married [[Myrna Weissman]], [[Ph.D.]], Professor of [[Epidemiology]] and [[Psychiatry]] at [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]] in 2005. He had four stepchildren: Susan Weissman of [[Evanston, Illinois|Evanston]], Illinois, Judith Weissman of [[New York, New York|New York]], New York, Sharon Weissman of [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], Connecticut, and Jonathan Weissman of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], California.  He was also survived by his sister, Joan Nirenberg Geiger of Dallas, Texas, several nieces and a nephew.

Nirenberg was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]] in 1964 and the National Medal of Honor in 1968 by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]].<ref>The Marshall W. Nirenberg Papers [https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/Narrative/JJ/p-nid/21 "Biographical Information"]</ref> In 1981, Nirenberg became a founding member of the [[World Cultural Council]].<ref>{{cite web | title = About Us | publisher = [[World Cultural Council]] | url = http://www.consejoculturalmundial.org/about-us/ | access-date = November 8, 2016}}</ref> In 1986, Nirenberg's achievements and contributions to the field of biochemistry genetics was recognized at an event honoring [[Maimonides]] and [[Menachem M. Schneerson]], in the nation's capital, hosted by [[Bob Dole]] and [[Joe Biden]].<ref>The Marshall W. Nirenberg Papers [https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/retrieve/ResourceMetadata/JJBBWG#transcript "Letter from Bob Dole and Joe Biden to Marshall W. Nirenberg"]</ref> He was elected to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 2001.  He died on January 15, 2010, from [[cancer]] after several months of illness.

==Research==
By 1958, experiments and analysis such as the [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment]], the [[Hershey–Chase experiment]], the [[Molecular Structure of Nucleic Acids: A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid|Watson–Crick structure]] and the [[Meselson–Stahl experiment]] had shown [[DNA]] to be the molecule of genetic information. It was not known, however, how DNA directed the expression of [[protein]]s, or what role [[RNA]] had in these processes. Nirenberg teamed up with [[Heinrich J. Matthaei]] at the [[National Institutes of Health]] to answer these questions. They produced [[RNA]] composed solely of [[uracil]], a [[nucleotide]] that only occurs in RNA. They then added this synthetic poly-uracil RNA into a cell-free extract of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' which contained the DNA, RNA, [[ribosome]]s and other cellular machinery for protein synthesis. They added [[DNase]], which breaks apart the DNA, so that no additional proteins would be produced other than that from their synthetic [[RNA]]. They then added 1 radioactively labeled [[amino acid]], the building blocks of proteins, and 19 unlabeled amino acids to the extract, varying the labeled amino acid in each sample. Only in the extract containing the radioactively labeled [[phenylalanine]], was the resulting protein also [[radioactive]]. This implied that the [[genetic code]] for phenylalanine on RNA consisted of a repetition of uracil bases. Indeed, as we know now, it is UUU (three uracil bases in a row). This was the first step in deciphering the [[codon]]s of the genetic code and the first demonstration of [[messenger RNA]] (see ''[[Nirenberg and Matthaei experiment]]'').<ref>{{Citation

In August 1961, at the International Congress of Biochemistry in Moscow, Nirenberg presented a paper to a small group of scientists, reporting the decoding of the first codon of the genetic code. [[Matthew Meselson]], who was in the audience, spontaneously hugged Nirenberg at the end of the talk and then told [[Francis Crick]] about Nirenberg's result.<ref name=NautilusGoldstein>{{cite web |url=https://nautil.us/issue/72/quandary/the-thrill-of-defeat-rp |title=The Thrill of Defeat: What Francis Crick and Sydney Brenner taught me about being scooped |last=Goldstein |first=Bob |date=May 30, 2019 |publisher=Nautilus |access-date=Jan 21, 2021}}</ref> Crick invited Nirenberg to repeat his performance the next day in a talk to a much larger audience.<ref>{{Citation | last1 = Caskey | first1 = C.

Within a few years, his research team had performed similar experiments and found that three-base repeats of [[adenosine]] (AAA) produced the amino acid [[lysine]], and [[cytosine]] repeats (CCC) produced [[proline]]. The next breakthrough came when [[Philip Leder]], a postdoctoral researcher in Nirenberg's lab, developed a method for determining the genetic code on pieces of [[tRNA]] (see ''[[Nirenberg and Leder experiment]]''). This greatly sped up the assignment of three-base codons to amino acids so that 50 codons were identified in this way. Khorana's experiments confirmed these results and completed the genetic code translation.

The period between 1961 and 1962 is often referred to as the "coding race" because of the competition between the labs of Nirenberg at NIH and Nobel laureate Severo Ochoa at New York University Medical School, who had a massive staff. Faced with the possibility of helping the first NIH scientist win a Nobel prize, many NIH scientists put aside their own work to help Nirenberg in deciphering the mRNA codons for amino acids. Dr. [[DeWitt Stetten, Jr.]], director of the National Institute of Arthritis and Metabolic Diseases, called this period of collaboration "NIH's finest hour".<ref>[http://history.nih.gov/exhibits/nirenberg/HS4_polyU.htm The PolyU Experiment]. history.nih.gov</ref>

Nirenberg's later research focused on [[neuroscience]], neural development, and the [[homeobox]] genes.
