'''Guan Moye''' ({{zh|t=管謨業|s=管谟业|p=Guǎn Móyè}}; born 17 February 1955), better known by the pen name '''Mo Yan''' ({{IPAc-en|m|oʊ|_|j|ɛ|n}}, {{zh|c=莫言|p=Mò Yán}}), is a Chinese novelist and short story writer.  Donald Morrison of<!--As in he is the journalist who wrote the article--> U.S. news magazine ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' referred to him as "one of the most famous, oft-banned and widely [[Copyright infringement|pirated]] of all [[List of Chinese writers|Chinese writers]]",<ref name="Holding Up Half The Sky"/> and [[Jim Leach]] called him the Chinese answer to [[Franz Kafka]] or [[Joseph Heller]].<ref name="Leach"/>

He is best known to Western readers for his 1987 novel  ''[[Red Sorghum Clan]]'', of which the ''Red Sorghum'' and ''Sorghum Wine'' volumes were later adapted for the film ''[[Red Sorghum (film)|Red Sorghum]]'' in 1988 and won the prize at the [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin International Film Festiva]]<nowiki/>l. He won the 2005 [[Nonino#Winners|International Nonino Prize]] in Italy.

==Early life==
Mo Yan was born in February of 1955 into a peasant family in Ping'an Village, Gaomi Township, northeast of [[Shandong|Shandong Province]], the People's Republic of China. His family was of a upper-middle peasant class background.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Leung|first=Laifong|title=Contemporary Chinese Fiction Writers: Biography, Bibliography, and Critical Assessment|publisher=Taylor & Francis Group|year=2016|pages=197|language=en}}</ref> Mo was 11 years old when the [[Cultural Revolution]] was launched, at which time he left school to work as a farmer. In the autumn of 1973, he began work at the cotton oil processing factory. During this period, which coincided with a succession of political campaigns from the [[Great Leap Forward]] to the [[Cultural Revolution]], his access to literature was largely limited to novels in the [[Socialist realism|socialist realist]] style under Mao Zedong, which centered largely on the themes of class struggle and conflict.<ref name=Kenyon>Anna Sun. [http://www.kenyonreview.org/kr-online-issue/2012-fall/selections/anna-sun-656342/ "The Diseased Language of Mo Yan"], The Kenyon Review, Fall 2012.</ref>

At the close of the Cultural Revolution in 1976, Mo enlisted in the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA),<ref name="reutersNobel"/> and began writing while he was still a soldier. During this post-Revolution era when he emerged as a writer, both the lyrical and epic works of Chinese literature, as well as translations of foreign authors such as [[William Faulkner]] and [[Gabriel García Márquez]], would make an impact on his works.<ref name="Laughlin">{{cite news|url=http://cn.nytimes.com/article/culture-arts/2012/12/17/c17moyan/en/?pagemode=print|title=What Mo Yan's Detractors Get Wrong|first=Charles|last=Laughlin|date=17 December 2012|access-date=17 December 2012|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

In 1984, he received a literary award from the ''PLA Magazine'', and the same year began attending the [[People's Liberation Army Arts College]], where he first adopted the pen name of Mo Yan.<ref name="Williford"/> He published his first novella, ''A Transparent Radish,'' in 1984, and released ''Red Sorghum'' in 1986, launching his career as a nationally recognized novelist.<ref name="Williford"/> In 1991, he graduated from the creation graduate class of Lu Xun School of literature, and obtained a master's degree in Literature from [[Beijing Normal University]].<ref name="reutersNobel" />

==Pen name==
"Mo Yan" – "don't speak" in Chinese – is his pen name.<ref name="ahlander"/> Mo Yan has explained on occasion that the name comes from a warning from his father and mother not to speak his mind while outside, because of China's revolutionary political situation from the 1950s, when he grew up.<ref name="Leach"/><ref name=nobelspeech/> It also relates to the subject matter of Mo Yan's writings, which reinterpret Chinese political and sexual history.<ref name="Huang"/>

In an interview with Professor David Wang, Mo Yan stated that he changed his "official name" to Mo Yan because he could not receive royalties under the pen name.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXhJwiWebZE&t=296|title=ChinaX: Introducing Mo Yan|last=SW12X - ChinaX|date=18 February 2015|access-date=7 November 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref>

==Works==
Mo Yan began his career as a writer in the [[reform and opening up]] period, publishing dozens of short stories and novels in Chinese. His first novel was ''Falling Rain on a Spring Night'', published in 1981.

Mo Yan's ''[[Red Sorghum Clan]]'' is a non-chronological novel about the generations of a Shandong family between 1923 and 1976. The author deals with upheavals in Chinese history such as the Second Sino-Japanese War, the 1949 Communist Revolution, and the [[Cultural Revolution]], but in an unconventional way; for example from the point of view of the invading Japanese soldiers.<ref name="Inge"/>

His second novel, ''The Garlic Ballads'', is based on a true story of when the farmers of Gaomi Township rioted against a government that would not buy its crops. ''[[The Republic of Wine]]'' is a satire around gastronomy and alcohol, which uses [[cannibalism]] as a metaphor for Chinese self-destruction, following Lu Xun.<ref name="Inge"/> ''Big Breasts & Wide Hips'' deals with female bodies, from a grandmother whose breasts are shattered by Japanese bullets, to a festival where one of the child characters, Shangguan Jintong, blesses each woman of his town by stroking her breasts.<ref name="Chan"/> The book was controversial in China because some [[Chinese New Left|leftist critics]] objected to ''Big Breasts''' perceived negative portrayal of Communist soldiers.<ref name="Chan"/>

Extremely prolific, Mo Yan wrote ''[[Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out]]'' in only 42 days.<ref name="Leach"/> He composed the more than 500,000 characters contained in the original manuscript on traditional Chinese paper using only ink and a writing brush. He prefers writing his novels by hand rather than by typing using a [[pinyin]] [[input method]], because the latter method "limits your vocabulary".<ref name="Leach"/> ''Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out'' is a meta-fiction about the story of a landlord who is reincarnated in the form of various animals during the Chinese [[land reform]] movement.<ref name="Williford"/> The landlord observes and satirizes Communist society, such as when he (as a donkey) forces two mules to share food with him, because "[in] the age of communism... mine is yours and yours is mine."<ref name="Huang"/>

''[[Pow! (novel)|Pow!]],'' Mo Yan’s first work to be translated into english after receiving the Nobel Prize, is about a young storytelling boy named Luo who was famous in his village for eating so much meat.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2013-01-18|title=Pow! by Mo Yan – review|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jan/18/pow-mo-yan-review|access-date=2021-12-07|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref> His village is so carnivorous it is an obsession that leads to corruption.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Garner|first=Dwight|date=2013-01-01|title=A Meaty Tale, Carnivorous and Twisted|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/books/pow-by-mo-yan.html|access-date=2021-12-07|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> ''Pow!'' cemented his writing style as “hallucinatory realism”.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 2012|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/2012/press-release/|access-date=2021-12-07|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US}}</ref> Another one of his works, [[Frog (novel)|''Frog'']], Yan’s latest novel published, focuses on the cause and consequences of China’s [[One-child policy|One-Child Policy]].

==Impact of works==

Mo Yan's ability to convey traditionalist values inside of his mythical realism writing style in ''The Old Gun'' has allowed insight and view on the swift modernization of China. This short story of Mo Yan was an exemplary example for the "[[Xungen movement]]" Chinese literary movement and influenced many to turn back to traditional values. This movement portrayed the fear of loss of cultural identity due to the swift modernization of China in the 1980s.<ref name="Norton"/>

Mo Yan’s masterpieces have been translated into English by translator [[Howard Goldblatt]]. Goldblatt has effectively transmitted [[Chinese culture]] to target audiences by using a [https://sites.psu.edu/futureoffood/2016/01/31/domestication-techniques-and-concepts/ domestication technique] augmented with [[Domestication and foreignization|foreignization]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ding|first=Rongrong|last2=Wang|first2=Lixun|date=2017-05-04|title=Mo Yan’s style in using colour expressions and Goldblatt’s translation strategies: a corpus-based study|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/23306343.2017.1331389|journal=Asia Pacific Translation and Intercultural Studies|volume=4|issue=2|pages=117–131|doi=10.1080/23306343.2017.1331389|issn=2330-6343}}</ref> 

==Influences==
Mo Yan's works are predominantly social commentary, and he is strongly influenced by the [[social realism]] of [[Lu Xun]] and the [[magical realism]] of Gabriel García Márquez. In terms of traditional Chinese literature, he is deeply inspired by the folklore-based classical epic novel ''[[Water Margin]]''.<ref name="remapping"/> He cites ''[[Journey to the West]]'' and ''[[Dream of the Red Chamber]]'' as formative influences.<ref name="Leach"/> Mo Yan's writing style has also been influenced by the [[Six Dynasties]], [[Chuanqi (short story)|Chuanqi]], notebook novels of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] Dynasties and especially by [http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CF%5CO%5CFolkoralliterature.htm folk oral literature]. His creation combines all of these inspirations into one of the most distinctive voices in [[world literature]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Goldblatt|first=Howard|date=2013-09-01|title=Mo Yan in Translation: One Voice among Many|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/21514399.2013.11833989|journal=Chinese Literature Today|volume=3|issue=1-2|pages=6–9|doi=10.1080/21514399.2013.11833989|issn=2151-4399}}</ref>

Mo Yan, who himself reads foreign authors in translation, strongly advocates the reading of world literature.<ref name="World Literature and China in a Global Age"/> At a speech to open the 2009 [[Frankfurt Book Fair]], he discussed [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]]'s idea of "world literature", stating that "literature can overcome the barriers that separate countries and nations".<ref name="A Writer Has a Nationality, but Literature Has No Boundary"/>

==Style==
Mo Yan's works are [[Epic (genre)|epic]] historical novels characterized by [[hallucinatory realism]] and containing elements of [[black humor]].<ref name="Huang"/> Mo Yan's language is distinguished by his imaginative use of colour expressions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ding|first=Rongrong|last2=Wang|first2=Lixun|date=2017-05-04|title=Mo Yan’s style in using colour expressions and Goldblatt’s translation strategies: a corpus-based study|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/23306343.2017.1331389|journal=Asia Pacific Translation and Intercultural Studies|volume=4|issue=2|pages=117–131|doi=10.1080/23306343.2017.1331389|issn=2330-6343}}</ref> A major theme in Mo Yan's works is the constancy of human greed and corruption, despite the influence of ideology.<ref name="Inge"/> Using dazzling, complex, and often graphically violent images, he sets many of his stories near his hometown, Northeast Gaomi Township in Shandong province. Mo Yan says he realised that he could make "[my] family, [the] people I'm familiar with, the villagers..." his characters after reading [[William Faulkner]]'s ''[[The Sound and the Fury]]''.<ref name="Leach"/> He satirizes the genre of [[socialist realism]] by placing workers and bureaucrats into absurd situations.<ref name="Huang"/>

Mo Yan's writing is characterised by the blurring of distinctions between "past and present, dead and living, as well as good and bad".<ref name="Chan"/> Mo Yan appears in his novels as a semi-autobiographical character who retells and modifies the author's other stories.<ref name="Williford"/> His female characters often fail to observe traditional [[gender role]]s, such as the mother of the Shangguan family in ''Big Breasts & Wide Hips'', who, failing to bear her husband any sons, instead is an adulterer, becoming pregnant with girls by a Swedish missionary and a Japanese soldier, among others. Male power is also portrayed cynically in ''Big Breasts & Wide Hips'', and there is only one male hero in the novel.<ref name="Chan"/>

==Nobel Prize in Literature, 2012==
[[File:Mo Yan 14 2012.jpg|thumb|240px|Mo Yan in Stockholm to receive the Nobel Prize in Literature 2012]]
On 11 October 2012, the [[Swedish Academy]] announced that Mo Yan had received the Nobel Prize in Literature for his work that "with [[hallucinatory realism]] merges folk tales, history and the contemporary".<ref name="Nobel" /> Aged 57 at the time of the announcement, he was the 109th recipient of the award and the first ever resident of mainland China to receive it. In his Award Ceremony Speech, [[Per Wästberg]] explained: "Mo Yan is a poet who tears down stereotypical propaganda posters, elevating the individual from an anonymous human mass. Using ridicule and sarcasm Mo Yan attacks history and its falsifications as well as deprivation and political hypocrisy."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2012/presentation-speech.html|title= The Nobel Prize in Literature 2012 – Award Ceremony Speech|publisher=[[Nobelprize.org]]|author=Per Wästberg|date=10 December 2012|access-date=25 May 2017|author-link= Per Wästberg}}</ref>

Swedish Academy head [[Peter Englund]] said less formally, "He has such a damn unique way of writing. If you read half a page of Mo Yan you immediately recognize it as him".<ref name="Chinese writer Mo Yan wins Nobel prize"/> During a seminar on Mo Yan at [[Beijing Normal University]] in April 2011, [https://www.ou.edu/cas/english/about/faculty/robert-con-davis-undiano Robert Con Davis-Undiano], Executive Director of CLT and WLT, revealed that he will be proposing Mo Yan for the 2012 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Davis address that, given Mo Yan's fame and production, his work should serve as the best ground in quality and depth of [[Modern Chinese Literature and Culture|modern Chinese literature]] for Westerners.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Davis-Undiano|first=Robert Con|date=2013-09-01|title=A Westerner's Reflection on Mo Yan|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/21514399.2013.11833993|journal=Chinese Literature Today|volume=3|issue=1-2|pages=21–25|doi=10.1080/21514399.2013.11833993|issn=2151-4399}}</ref>

==Controversies and criticism==
Winning the Nobel Prize occasioned both support and criticism.

Firstly, it won warm welcome from the Chinese government immediately after the announcement of the Nobel Prize. The ''[[People's Daily]] Online'', the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, published on 11 October 2012: "Congratulations to Mo Yan for winning the Nobel Prize in Literature! It is the first time for a writer of Chinese nationality to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. Today is the day that Chinese writers have awaited for too long and that Chinese people have awaited for too long."<ref name="PeopleDaily">{{cite web|url=http://opinion.people.com.cn/n/2012/1011/c1003-19234842.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014020909/http://opinion.people.com.cn/n/2012/1011/c1003-19234842.html |archive-date=14 October 2012 |script-title=zh:人民网评：祝贺莫言荣获诺贝尔文学奖！|language=zh }}</ref>

The Chinese writer [[Ma Jian (writer)|Ma Jian]] deplored Mo Yan's lack of solidarity and commitment to other Chinese writers and intellectuals who were punished or detained in violation of their constitutionally protected [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]].<ref name="From cowherd to Nobel, it was a long lonely journey: Mo Yan"/> Several other Chinese dissidents such as Ye Du and [[Ai Weiwei]] also criticized him,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hF40kSvhPqArvfADF4OBH3B_0QOg?docId=CNG.e0a83893fea5c249564658b0cf94c359.01|title=Mo Yan Nobel lecture derided by China dissidents|agency=Agence France-Presse|date=8 December 2012|access-date=8 December 2012}}</ref> as did 2009 Nobel Laureate [[Herta Müller]] who called the decision a "catastrophe".<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/nov/26/mo-yan-nobel-herta-muller ''Salon'' 6 December 2012.</ref> A specific criticism was that Mo hand-copied [[Mao Zedong]]'s influential ''[[Yan'an Talks on Literature and Art]]'' in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the speech, which described the writer's responsibility to place politics before art.<ref name="Is Mo Yan man enough for the Nobel?"/> These "Talks"—which were the intellectual handcuffs of Chinese writers throughout the Mao era and were almost universally reviled by writers during the years between Mao's death in 1976 and the Tiananmen protest in 1989—were now again being held up for adulation. Mo Yan not only agreed but has gone further than others to explain that the "Talks," in their time, had "historical necessity" and "played a positive role."<ref>Perry Link [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/dec/06/mo-yan-nobel-prize/?pagination=false&printpage=true  "Does This Writer Deserve the Prize?"] [[New York Review of Books]], (6 December 2012).</ref> He has also attracted criticism for his supposed good relationship with the Chinese Communist Party in general.<ref name="The Nobel prize in literature: A Chinese Dickens?"/>

Mo Yan released a publication by the name of ''Big Breasts and Wide Hips'' that caught criticism and came under fire for its sexual content and how it portrayed the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] in early 20th century China. Due to the abundance of negative feedback from the community, Mo Yan was forced to withdraw this short story from publication.<ref name="Morgan"/>

Anna Sun, an assistant professor of Sociology and Asian studies at [[Kenyon College]], criticized Mo's writing as coarse, predictable, and lacking in aesthetic conviction. "Mo Yan's language is striking indeed," she writes, but it is striking because "it is diseased. The disease is caused by the conscious renunciation of China's cultural past at the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949."<ref name=Kenyon/> [[Charles Laughlin]] of the [[University of Virginia]], however, accuses Sun of "piling up aesthetic objections to conceal ideological conflict," comparing her characterization of Mo to the official [[China Writers Association]]'s characterization of [[Gao Xingjian]] as a mediocre writer when Gao won the Nobel Prize in 2000.<ref name="Laughlin"/>

[[Perry Link]], describing Mo Yan's fiction and politics in the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'', asked, "Does this writer deserve the prize?" Link commented that Chinese writers, whether "inside the system" or not, "all must choose how they will relate to their country's authoritarian government." This "inevitably involves calculations, trade-offs, and the playing of cards in various ways." Link's main criticism was that Mo Yan "invoke(d) a kind of daft hilarity when treating 'sensitive' events" such as the [[Great Chinese Famine]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Link believed that the regime approved it because "this mode of writing is useful not just because it diverts a square look at history but because of its function as a safety valve." As Link pointed out, to treat sensitive topics as jokes might be better than banning them outright. Link compared Mo to [[Liu Xiaobo]], winner of the 2010 Nobel Peace Prize, who was jailed for dissidence, whose moral choices were "highly unusual." It would be wrong, Link concludes, "for spectators like you and me, who enjoy the comfort of distance, to demand that Mo Yan risk all and be another Liu Xiaobo. But it would be even more wrong to mistake the clear difference between the two."<ref>Perry Link,[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2012/dec/06/mo-yan-nobel-prize/?pagination=false&printpage=true  "Does This Writer Deserve the Prize?"] [[New York Review of Books]], (6 December 2012).</ref>

Charles Laughlin, however, published an article called ''What Mo Yan's Detractors Get Wrong''<ref name="Laughlin2">[https://www.chinafile.com/what-mo-yans-detractors-get-wrong], What Mo Yan's Detractors Get Wrong</ref> on ChinaFile against Link's argument. As a response to Link's criticism that Mo Yan trivialized serious historical tragedies by using black humor and what he called "daft hilarity", Laughlin emphasized the distinction between documentary and art and literature: "art and literature, particularly since the traumas of the twentieth century, never simply document experience." Laughlin argued that Mo Yan's intended readers already know that "the [[Great Leap Forward]] led to a catastrophic famine, and any artistic approach to historical trauma is inflected or refracted." According to him, "Mo Yan writes about the period he writes about because they were traumatic, not because they were hilarious."<ref name = "Laughlin2" />

[[Salman Rushdie]] called Mo Yan a "patsy" for refusing to sign a petition asking for Liu Xiaobo's freedom.<ref>[http://www.salon.com/2012/12/07/rushdie_mo_yan_is_a_patsy_of_the_regime "Rushdie: Mo Yan is a "patsy of the regime"]. ''Salon'' 6 December 2012.</ref> [[Pankaj Mishra]] saw an "unexamined assumption" lurking in the "western scorn" for these choices, namely that "Anglo-American writers" were not criticized for similarly apolitical attitudes.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/13/mo-yan-salman-rushdie-censorship?INTCMP=SRCH|Why Salman Rushdie should pause before condemning Mo Yan on censorship]''The Guardian'' 13 December 2012.</ref>

In a rare interview with German newspaper [[Der Spiegel]], Mo Yan, using a translator said "I know he envies me for this award and I understand this. But his criticism is unjustified," about fellow Chinese writer and musician [[Liao Yiwu]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|date=2013-02-28|title=Mo Yan dismisses 'envious' Nobel critics|url=http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/28/mo-yan-dismisses-nobel-critics|access-date=2021-12-07|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref> He also stated that his major critics, "use magnifying glasses to look for my flaws and they even distort the meaning of my poems".<ref name=":1" />

In his Nobel Lecture, Mo Yan himself commented, "At first I thought I was the target of the disputes, but over time I've come to realize that the real target was a person who had nothing to do with me. Like someone watching a play in a theater, I observed the performances around me. I saw the winner of the prize both garlanded with flowers and besieged by stone-throwers and mudslingers." He concluded that "for a writer, the best way to speak is by writing. You will find everything I need to say in my works. Speech is carried off by the wind; the written word can never be obliterated."<ref name=nobelspeech>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/2012/yan-lecture_en.html "Mo Yan – Nobel Lecture: Storytellers"]. translated by Howard Goldblatt, 26 February 2013</ref>

Another source of criticism was a perceived conflict of interest on the part of [[Göran Malmqvist]], who is one of the members of the [[Swedish Academy]]. Malmqvist had translated several of Mo Yan's works into Swedish and published some through his own publishing house. Mo had also written a laudatory preface to one of Malmqvist's own books, and been a close friend of Malmqvist's wife for 15 years.
