'''Robert Woodrow Wilson''' (born January 10, 1936) is an American [[astronomer]] who, along with [[Arno Allan Penzias]], discovered [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] (CMB) in 1964.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.space.com/25945-cosmic-microwave-background-discovery-50th-anniversary.html|title=Cosmic Anniversary: 'Big Bang Echo' Discovered 50 Years Ago Today|last=May 2014|first=Mike Wall 20|website=Space.com|language=en|access-date=March 13, 2020}}</ref> The pair won the 1978 [[Nobel Prize in physics|Nobel prize in physics]] for their discovery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/1978/summary/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1978|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=March 13, 2020}}</ref>

While doing tests and experiments with the [[Holmdel Horn Antenna]] at [[Bell Labs]] in [[Holmdel Township, New Jersey]], Wilson and Penzias discovered a source of noise in the atmosphere that they could not explain.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Penzias|first1 = A.A.|last2 = Wilson|first2=R.W.|title=A Measurement of Excess Antenna Temperature at 4080 Mc/s|journal=[[Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=142|pages=419–421|date=1965|doi=10.1086/148307|bibcode=1965ApJ...142..419P}}</ref> After removing all potential sources of noise, including pigeon droppings on the antenna, the noise was finally identified as CMB, which served as important corroboration of the [[Big Bang]] theory.

In 1970, Wilson led a team that made the first detection of a rotational spectral line of carbon monoxide  (CO) in an astronomical object, the [[Orion Nebula]], and eight other galactic sources.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wilson|first1 = R.W.|last2 = Jefferts|first2=K.B.|last3=Penzias|first3=A.A.|title=Carbon Monoxide in the Orion Nebula|journal=[[Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=161|pages=L43–L44|date=1970|doi=10.1086/180567|bibcode=1970ApJ...161..L43P}}</ref> Subsequently, [[Carbon_monoxide#Astronomy|CO observations]] became the standard method of tracing cool molecular interstellar gas, and detection of CO was the foundational event for the fields of millimeter and submillimeter astronomy.

==Life and work==
Robert Woodrow Wilson was born on January 10, 1936, in Houston, Texas. He graduated from [[Lamar High School (Houston)|Lamar High School]] in River Oaks, in [[Houston]],<ref name="HISDAlumni">"[http://www.houstonisd.org/HISDConnectDS/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=c3783acb02efc010VgnVCM10000052147fa6RCRD Distinguished HISD Alumni] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/65iBEfhqh?url=http://www.houstonisd.org/HISDConnectDS/v/index.jsp?vgnextoid=c3783acb02efc010VgnVCM10000052147fa6RCRD |date=February 25, 2012 }}," ''[[Houston Independent School District]]''</ref> and studied as an undergraduate at [[Rice University]], also in Houston, where he was inducted into the [[Phi Beta Kappa]] society. He then earned a PhD in physics at [[California Institute of Technology]].

Wilson and Penzias also won the [[Henry Draper Medal]] of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1977.<ref name=Draper>{{cite web|title=Henry Draper Medal|url=http://www.nasonline.org/about-nas/awards/henry-draper-medal.html|publisher=[[National Academy of Sciences]]|access-date=February 24, 2011}}</ref> Wilson received the Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]] in 1987.<ref>{{cite web|title= Golden Plate Awardees of the American Academy of Achievement |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://achievement.org/our-history/golden-plate-awards/#science-exploration}}</ref>

Wilson remained at Bell Laboratories until 1994, when he was named a senior scientist at the [[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] in Cambridge, Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fofweb.com/History/MainPrintPage.asp?iPin=AS0290&DataType=AmericanHistory&WinType=Free |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 2, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407073319/http://www.fofweb.com/History/MainPrintPage.asp?iPin=AS0290&DataType=AmericanHistory&WinType=Free |archive-date=April 7, 2014 }}</ref>

Wilson has been a resident of [[Holmdel Township, New Jersey]].<ref>Nobel Lectures, Physics 1971–1980, Editor Stig Lundqvist, World Scientific Publishing Co., Singapore, 1992. {{Nobelprize|name=Autobiography}}. Accessed March 15, 2011. "We still live in the house in Holmdel which we bought when I first came to Bell Laboratories."</ref>

Wilson married Elizabeth Rhoads Sawin<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1978/wilson-bio.html|title=Robert Woodrow Wilson - Biographical|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=June 7, 2016}}</ref> in 1958.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/938/000099641/|title=Robert Woodrow Wilson|website=www.nndb.com|access-date=June 7, 2016}}</ref>

Wilson is one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President [[George W. Bush]] in May 2008, urging him to "reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill" by requesting additional emergency funding for the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]'s [[Office of Science]], the [[National Science Foundation]], and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=A Letter from America's Physics Nobel Laureates|url=https://fire.pppl.gov/nobel_bush_fy08_050808.pdf}}</ref>

Wilson was elected to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|title=APS Member History|url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=Robert+W.+Wilson&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced|access-date=2021-04-23|website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref>
