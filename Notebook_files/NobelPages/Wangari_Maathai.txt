In 1977, Maathai founded the [[Green Belt Movement]],<ref name="greenbelt obit">{{Cite news|url=https://www.greenbeltmovement.org/wangari-maathai|title=Wangari Maathai, Nobel peace prize winner, dies at 71|last=Rice|first=Xan|date=26 September 2011|work=The Guardian|access-date=13 April 2019|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref name="greenbelt bio">{{Cite web|url=http://www.greenbeltmovement.org/wangari-maathai/biography|title=Biography {{!}} The Green Belt Movement|last=http://www.cstraight.com|first=Cstraight Media -|website=www.greenbeltmovement.org|language=en|access-date=23 May 2018}}</ref> an environmental non-governmental organisation focused on the planting of trees, [[environmental conservation]], and [[women's rights]]. In 1984, she was awarded the [[Right Livelihood Award]] for "converting the Kenyan ecological debate into mass action for reforestation". Maathai was an elected member of the [[National Assembly of Kenya|Parliament of Kenya]] and between January 2003 and November 2005 served as assistant minister for environment and natural resources in the government of President [[Mwai Kibaki]]. She was an Honorary Councillor of the [[World Future Council]]. As an academic and the author of several books, Maathai was not only an activist but also an intellectual who has made significant contributions to thinking about ecology, development, gender, and African cultures and religions.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Muhonja|first=Besi Brillian|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1155925037|title=Radical utu : critical ideas and ideals of Wangari Muta Maathai|year=2020|isbn=978-0-89680-507-1|location=Athens, Ohio|oclc=1155925037}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Musila|first=Grace|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1148322483|title=Wangari Maathai's Registers of freedom|publisher=HSRC Press|others=Grace A.

Maathai died of complications from [[ovarian cancer]] on 25 September 2011.

==Early life and education==
Maathai was born on 1 April 1940 in the village of Ihithe, [[Nyeri District]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.greenbeltmovement.org/wangari-maathai|title=Wangari Maathai {{!}} The Green Belt Movement|last=http://www.cstraight.com|first=Cstraight Media-|website=www.greenbeltmovement.org|language=en|access-date=13 April 2019}}</ref> in the [[Central Province (Kenya)|central highlands]] of the [[colony of Kenya]]. Her family was [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], the most populous [[List of ethnic groups of Kenya|ethnic group in Kenya]], and had lived in the area for several generations.<ref>Wangari Maathai, ''Unbowed: A Memoir'', [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]], 2006. {{ISBN|0-307-26348-7}}, p. 3.</ref> Around 1943, Maathai's family relocated to a White-owned farm in the [[Rift Valley Province|Rift Valley]], near the town of [[Nakuru]], where her father had found work.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 14–15.</ref> Late in 1947, she returned to Ihithe with her mother, as two of her brothers were attending primary school in the village, and there was no schooling available on the farm where her father worked. Her father remained at the farm.<ref>''Unbowed'', p. 29.</ref> Shortly afterward, at the age of eight, she joined her brothers at Ihithe Primary School.

At the age of 11, Maathai moved to St. Cecilia's Intermediate Primary School, a [[boarding school]] at the [[Nyeri#Religion|Mathari Catholic Mission]] in Nyeri.<ref>''Unbowed'', p. 53.</ref> Maathai studied at St. Cecilia's for four years. During this time, she became fluent in English and converted to Catholicism. She was involved with the [[Legion of Mary]], whose members attempted "to serve God by serving fellow human beings."<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 60–61.</ref> Studying at St. Cecilia's, she was sheltered from the ongoing [[Mau Mau uprising]], which forced her mother to move from their homestead to an emergency village in Ihithe.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 63–69.</ref> When she completed her studies there in 1956, she was rated first in her class, and was granted admission to the only Catholic high school for girls in Kenya, [[Loreto High School, Limuru|Loreto High School]] in [[Limuru]].<ref>''Unbowed'', p. 69.</ref>

As the end of East African colonialism approached, Kenyan politicians, such as [[Tom Mboya]], were proposing ways to make education in [[Western world#Modern definitions|Western nations]] available to promising students. [[John F. Kennedy]], then a [[United States Senator]], agreed to fund such a program through the [[Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation]], initiating what became known as [[the Kennedy Airlift]] or Airlift Africa. Maathai became one of some 300 Kenyans selected to study in the United States in September 1960.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 73–74.</ref>

She received a scholarship to study at Mount St. Scholastica College (now [[Benedictine College]]), in [[Atchison, Kansas]], where she [[Academic major|majored]] in biology, with [[Academic minor|minors]] in chemistry and German.<ref>''Unbowed'', p. 79.</ref> After receiving her Bachelor of Science degree in 1964, she studied at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] for a master's degree in biology. Her graduate studies there were funded by the [[Africa-America Institute]],<ref>''Unbowed'', p. 92.</ref> and during her time in [[Pittsburgh]], she first experienced [[environmental restoration]], when local environmentalists pushed to rid the city of air pollution.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 93–94.</ref> In January 1966, Maathai received her MSc in biological sciences,<ref name="UNCCD">[http://www.unccd.int/IYDD/documents/iydd_docs/WANGARIMAATHAICV.pdf UNCCD profile of Wangari Maathai] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927152236/http://www.unccd.int/IYDD/documents/iydd_docs/WANGARIMAATHAICV.pdf |date=27 September 2011 }}. Retrieved 10 April 2009</ref> and was appointed to a position as [[research assistant]] to a professor of zoology at [[University of Nairobi|University College of Nairobi]].<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 94–95.</ref>

Upon returning to Kenya, Maathai dropped her forename, preferring to be known by her birth name, Wangarĩ Muta.<ref>''Unbowed'', p. 96.</ref> When she arrived at the university to start her new job, she was informed that it had been given to someone else. Maathai believed this was because of gender and tribal bias.<ref>''Unbowed'', p. 101.</ref> After a two-month job search, Professor Reinhold Hofmann, from the [[University of Giessen]] in Germany, offered her a job as a research assistant in the [[microanatomy]] section of the newly established Department of Veterinary Anatomy in the School of Veterinary Medicine at University College of Nairobi.<ref>''Unbowed'', p. 102.</ref> In April 1966, she met [[Mwangi Mathai]], another Kenyan who had studied in America, who would later become her husband.<ref>''Unbowed'', p. 105.</ref> She also rented a small shop in the city, and established a general store, at which her sisters worked. In 1967, at the urging of Professor Hofmann, she travelled to the [[University of Giessen]] in Germany in pursuit of a doctorate. She studied both at Giessen and the [[University of Munich]].

In the spring of 1969, she returned to [[Nairobi]] to continue studies at the University College of Nairobi as an assistant lecturer. In May, she and Mwangi Mathai married.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 106–109.</ref> Later that year, she became pregnant with her first child, and her husband campaigned for a seat in [[National Assembly of Kenya|Parliament]], narrowly losing. During the course of the election, Tom Mboya, who had been instrumental in founding the program which sent her overseas, was assassinated. This led to President Kenyatta effectually ending multi-party democracy in Kenya. Shortly after, her first son, Waweru, was born.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 109–11.</ref> In 1971, she became the first [[East Africa|Eastern African]] woman to receive a PhD, her doctorate in veterinary anatomy,<ref name="UNCCD"/> from the University College of Nairobi, which became the [[University of Nairobi]] the following year. She completed her dissertation on the development and differentiation of gonads in bovines.<ref>''Unbowed'', p. 112.</ref> Her daughter, [[Wanjira Mathai|Wanjira]], was born in December 1971.

==1972–1977: Activism and political life==
Maathai continued to teach at Nairobi, becoming a senior lecturer in anatomy in 1975, chair of the Department of Veterinary Anatomy in 1976 and associate professor in 1977. She was the first woman in Nairobi appointed to any of these positions.<ref name="NobelBio">[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2004/maathai-bio.html Wangari Maathai, the Nobel Peace Prize 2004] Nobel Foundation. Retrieved 24 February 2009.</ref> During this time, she campaigned for equal benefits for the women working on the staff of the university, going so far as trying to turn the academic staff association of the university into a union, in order to negotiate for benefits. The courts denied this bid, but many of her demands for equal benefits were later met.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 114–118.</ref> In addition to her work at the University of Nairobi, Maathai became involved in a number of civic organisations in the early 1970s. She was a member of the Nairobi branch of the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Kenya Red Cross Society]], becoming its director in 1973. She was a member of the Kenya Association of University Women. Following the establishment of the Environment Liaison Centre in 1974, Maathai was asked to be a member of the local board, eventually becoming board chair. The Environment Liaison Centre worked to promote the participation of non-governmental organisations in the work of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), whose headquarters was established in Nairobi following the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] held in [[Stockholm]] in 1972. Maathai also joined the National Council of Women of Kenya (NCWK).<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 119–122.</ref> Through her work at these various volunteer associations, it became evident to Maathai that the root of most of Kenya's problems was environmental degradation.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 124–125.</ref>

In 1974, Maathai's family expanded to include her third child, son Muta. Her husband campaigned again for a seat in Parliament, hoping to represent the [[Langata Constituency|Lang'ata constituency]], and won. During his campaign, he had promised to find jobs to limit the rising unemployment in Kenya. These promises led Maathai to connect her ideas of environmental restoration to providing jobs for the unemployed and led to the founding of Envirocare Ltd., a business that involved the planting of trees to conserve the environment, involving ordinary people in the process. This led to the planting of her first tree nursery, collocated with a government tree nursery in [[Karura Forest]]. Envirocare ran into multiple problems, primarily dealing with funding. The project failed. However, through conversations concerning Envirocare and her work at the Environment Liaison Centre, UNEP made it possible to send Maathai to the first [[Habitat I|UN conference on human settlements]], known as Habitat I, in June 1976.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 125–129.</ref>

In 1977, Maathai spoke to the NCWK concerning her attendance at Habitat I. She proposed further tree planting, which the council supported. On 5 June 1977, marking World Environment Day, the NCWK marched in a procession from [[Kenyatta International Conference Centre]] in downtown Nairobi to Kamukunji Park on the outskirts of the city, where they planted seven trees in honour of historical community leaders. This was the first event of the [[Green Belt Movement]].<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 130–132.</ref> Maathai encouraged the women of Kenya to plant tree nurseries throughout the country, searching nearby forests for seeds to grow trees native to the area. She agreed to pay the women a small stipend for each seedling which was later planted elsewhere.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 134–137.</ref>

In her 2010 book, ''Replenishing the Earth: Spiritual Values for Healing Ourselves and the World'', she discussed the impact of the Green Belt Movement, explaining that the group's civic and environmental seminars stressed "the importance of communities taking responsibility for their actions and mobilizing to address their local needs," and adding, "We all need to work hard to make a difference in our neighborhoods, regions, and countries, and in the world as a whole. That means making sure we work hard, collaborate with each other, and make ourselves better agents to change."<ref>Snyder, Laurie. "[https://thecontemplativetraveler.wordpress.com/2016/10/09/god-is-green-as-well-as-good-how-nobel-laureate-wangari-maathai-changed-the-world/ God Is Green as Well as Good: How Nobel Laureate Wangari Maathai Changed the World One Tree at a Time]." ''The Contemplative Traveler'', 9 October 2016.</ref> In this book, she explicitly engages with religious traditions, including indigenous Kikuyu religion and Christianity, mobilizing them as resources for environmental thinking and activism.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=van Klinken|first=Adriaan|date=24 May 2021|title=Wangari Maathai's Environmental Bible as an African Knowledge: Eco-spirituality, Christianity, and Decolonial Thought|journal=Eastern African Literary and Cultural Studies|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/23277408.2021.1922129|issn=2327-7408|doi-access=free}}</ref>

===1977–1979: Personal problems===
Maathai and her husband, Mwangi Mathai, separated in 1977. After a lengthy separation, Mwangi filed for divorce in 1979. He was said to have believed that Wangari was "too strong-minded for a woman" and that he was "unable to control her". In addition to naming her as "cruel" in court filings, he publicly accused her of adultery with another Member of Parliament,<ref name="NYTNairobiJournal">Perlez, Jane, [https://www.nytimes.com/1989/12/06/world/nairobi-journal-skyscraper-s-enemy-draws-a-daily-dose-of-scorn.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm "Nairobi Journal; Skyscraper's Enemy Draws a Daily Dose of Scorn"], ''The New York Times'', 6 December 1989. Retrieved 16 April 2009.</ref> which in turn was thought to cause his high blood pressure and the judge ruled in Mwangi's favour. Shortly after the trial, in an interview with ''Viva'' magazine, Maathai referred to the judge as either incompetent or corrupt.<ref name="NYTNairobiJournal"/> The interview later led the judge to charge Maathai with contempt of court. She was found guilty and sentenced to six months in jail. After three days in Lang'ata Women's Prison in Nairobi, her lawyer formulated a statement which the court found sufficient for her release. Shortly after the divorce, her former husband sent a letter via his lawyer demanding that Maathai drop his surname. She chose to add an extra "a" instead of changing her name.<ref>[http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id=7939651 "Conservation and Feminism: Africa's Greenheart."] ''The Economist'', 21 September 2006.</ref><ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 139–151.</ref>

The divorce had been costly, and with lawyers' fees and the loss of her husband's income, Maathai found it difficult to provide for herself and their children on her university wages. An opportunity arose to work for the [[Economic Commission for Africa]] through the [[United Nations Development Programme]]. As this job required extended travel throughout Africa and was based primarily in [[Lusaka, Zambia]], she was unable to bring her children with her. Maathai chose to send them to her ex-husband and take the job. While she visited them regularly, they lived with their father until 1985.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 151–155.</ref>

===1979–1982: Political problems===
In 1979, shortly after the divorce, Maathai ran for the position of chairperson of the [[National Council of Women of Kenya]] (NCWK), an [[umbrella organisation]] consisting of many women's organisations in the country. The newly elected [[President of Kenya]], [[Daniel arap Moi]], tried to limit the amount of influence those of the Kikuyu ethnicity held in the country, including in volunteer civic organisations such as the NCWK. She lost this election by three votes, but was overwhelmingly chosen to be the vice-chairman of the organisation. The following year, Maathai again ran for chairman of the NCWK. Again she was opposed, she believes, by the government. When it became apparent that Maathai was going to win the election, [[Maendeleo Ya Wanawake]], a member organisation which represented a majority of Kenya's rural women and whose leader was close to Arap Moi, withdrew from the NCWK. Maathai was then elected chairman of the NCWK unopposed. However, Maendeleo Ya Wanawake came to receive a majority of the financial support for women's programs in the country, and NCWK was left virtually bankrupt. Future funding was much more difficult to come by, but the NCWK survived by increasing its focus on the environment and making its presence and work known. Maathai continued to be reelected to serve as chairman of the organisation every year until she retired from the position in 1987.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 156–160.</ref>

In 1982, the Parliamentary seat representing her home region of Nyeri was open, and Maathai decided to campaign for the seat. As required by law, she resigned her position with the University of Nairobi to campaign for office. The courts decided that she was ineligible to run for office because she had not re-registered to vote in the last presidential election in 1979. Maathai believed this to be false and illegal, and brought the matter to court. The court was to meet at nine in the morning, and if she received a favorable ruling, was required to present her candidacy papers in Nyeri by three in the afternoon that day. The judge disqualified her from running on a technicality. {{Clarify|date=May 2013}} When she requested her job back, she was denied. As she lived in university housing and was no longer a staff member, she was evicted.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 160–163.</ref>

===Green Belt Movement===
{{main|Green Belt Movement}}
Maathai moved into a small home she had purchased years before, and focused on the NCWK before becoming employed again. In the course of her work through the NCWK, she had the opportunity to partner with the executive director of the Norwegian Forestry Society, Wilhelm Elsrud. Maathai became the coordinator. Along with the partnership for the Norwegian Forestry Society, the movement had also received "seed money" from the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Women. These funds allowed for the expansion of the movement, for hiring additional employees to oversee the operations, and for continuing to pay a small stipend to the women who planted seedlings throughout the country. It allowed her to refine the operations of the movement, paying a small stipend to the women's husbands and sons who were literate and able to keep accurate records of seedlings planted.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 168–173.</ref>

The UN held the third global women's conference in Nairobi. During the conference, Maathai arranged seminars and presentations to describe the work the Green Belt Movement was doing in Kenya. She escorted delegates to see nurseries and plant trees. She met Peggy Snyder, the head of UNIFEM, and [[Helvi Sipilä]], the first woman appointed a UN assistant secretary general. The conference helped to expand funding for the Green Belt Movement and led to the movement's establishing itself outside Kenya. In 1986, with funding from UNEP, the movement expanded throughout Africa and led to the foundation of the Pan-African Green Belt Network. Forty-five representatives from fifteen African countries travelled to Kenya over the next three years to learn how to set up similar programs in their own countries to combat desertification, deforestation, water crises, and rural hunger. The attention the movement received in the media led to Maathai's being honored with numerous awards. The government of Kenya, however, demanded that the Green Belt Movement separate from the NCWK, believing the latter should focus solely on women's issues, not the environment. Therefore, in 1987, Maathai stepped down as chairperson of the NCWK and focused on the newly separate non-governmental organisation.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 175–179.</ref>

===Government intervention===
In the latter half of the 1980s, the Kenyan government came down against Maathai and the Green Belt Movement. The single-party regime opposed many of the movement's positions regarding democratic rights. The government invoked a colonial-era law prohibiting groups of more than nine people from meeting without a government license. In 1988, the Green Belt Movement carried out pro-democracy activities such as registering voters for the election and pressing for constitutional reform and freedom of expression. The government carried out electoral fraud in the elections to maintain power, according to Maathai.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 180–183.</ref>

In October 1989, Maathai learned of a plan to construct the 60-storey Kenya Times Media Trust Complex in [[Uhuru Park]]. The complex was intended to house the headquarters of KANU, the ''[[Kenya Times]]'' newspaper, a trading center, offices, an auditorium, galleries, shopping malls, and parking space for 2,000 cars. The plan also included a large statue of President Daniel Arap Moi. Maathai wrote many letters in protest to, among others, the ''Kenya Times'', the Office of the President, the Nairobi city commission, the provincial commissioner, the minister for environment and natural resources, the executive directors of UNEP and the Environment Liaison Centre International, the executive director of the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), the ministry of public works, and the permanent secretary in the department of international security and administration all received letters. She wrote to Sir John Johnson, the British high commissioner in Nairobi, urging him to intervene with Robert Maxwell, a major shareholder in the project, equating the construction of a tower in Uhuru Park to such construction in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] or [[Central Park]] and maintaining that it could not be tolerated.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 184–188.</ref>
{{Quote box|salign=center|width=300px|align=right|quote=When I see Uhuru Park and contemplate its meaning, I feel compelled to fight for it so that my grandchildren may share that dream and that joy of freedom as they one day walk there.|source=Wangarĩ Muta Maathai – ''Unbowed'', p. 192.}}
The government refused to respond to her inquiries and protests, instead responding through the media that Maathai was "a crazy woman"; that denying the project in Uhuru Park would take more than a small portion of public park land; and proclaiming the project as a "fine and magnificent work of architecture" opposed by only the "ignorant few." On 8 November 1989, Parliament expressed outrage at Maathai's actions, complaining of her letters to foreign organisations and calling the Green Belt Movement a bogus organisation and its members "a bunch of divorcees". They suggested that if Maathai was so comfortable writing to Europeans, perhaps she should go live in Europe.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 190–193.</ref>

Despite Maathai's protests, as well as popular protest growing throughout the city, the ground was broken at Uhuru Park for construction of the complex on 15 November 1989. Maathai sought an injunction in the Kenya High Court to halt construction, but the case was thrown out on 11 December. In his first public comments pertaining to the project, President Daniel Arap Moi stated that those who opposed the project had "insects in their heads". On 12 December, in Uhuru Park, during a speech celebrating independence from the British, President Moi suggested Maathai be a proper woman in the African tradition and respect men and be quiet.<ref>''Unbowed'', p. 196.</ref> She was forced by the government to vacate her office, and the Green Belt Movement was moved into her home. The government audited the Green Belt Movement in an apparent attempt to shut it down. Despite all this, her protests, the government's response – and the media coverage it garnered – led foreign investors to cancel the project in January 1990.<ref name="Ecologist">''The Ecologist'' (1 April 2001).

In January 1992, it came to the attention of Maathai and other pro-democracy activists that a list of people were targeted for assassination and that a government-sponsored coup was possible. Maathai's name was on the list. The pro-democracy group, known as the [[Forum for the Restoration of Democracy–Kenya|Forum for the Restoration of Democracy]] (FORD), presented its information to the media, calling for a general election. Later that day, Maathai received a warning that one of their members had been arrested. Maathai decided to barricade herself in her home. Shortly thereafter, police arrived and surrounded the house. She was besieged for three days before police cut through the bars she had installed on her windows, came in, and arrested her. She and the other pro-democracy activists who had been arrested were charged with spreading malicious rumors, sedition, and treason. After a day and a half in jail, they were brought to a hearing and released on bail. A variety of international organisations and eight senators (including [[Al Gore]] and [[Edward M. Kennedy]]) put pressure on the Kenyan government to substantiate the charges against the pro-democracy activists or risk damaging relations with the United States. In November 1992, the Kenyan government dropped the charges.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 208–215.</ref>

On 28 February 1992, while released on bail, Maathai and others took part in a [[hunger strike]] in a corner of Uhuru Park, which they labeled Freedom Corner, to pressure the government to release [[political prisoner]]s. After four days of hunger strike, on 3 March 1992, the police forcibly removed the protesters. Maathai and three others were knocked unconscious by police and hospitalized.<ref name="NYTLikeaTree">Lacey, Marc, [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/09/international/africa/09kenya.html "Like a Tree, Unbowed"], ''The New York Times'', 9 October 2004.

Retrieved 16 April 2009.</ref> When the prisoners were not released, the protesters – mostly mothers of those in prison – moved their protest to All Saints Cathedral, the seat of the [[Anglican Church of Kenya|Anglican Archbishop in Kenya]], across from Uhuru Park. The protest there continued, with Maathai contributing frequently, until early 1993, when the prisoners were finally released.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 217–225.</ref>

During this time, Maathai was recognized with various awards internationally, but the Kenyan government did not appreciate her work. In 1991 she received the [[Goldman Environmental Prize]] in San Francisco and the [[Hunger Project]]'s Africa Prize for Leadership in London. [[CNN]] aired a three-minute segment about the Goldman prize, but when it aired in Kenya, that segment was cut out. In June 1992, during the long protest at Uhuru Park, both Maathai and President arap Moi travelled to [[Rio de Janeiro]] for the UN Conference on Environment and Development ([[Earth Summit]]). The Kenyan government accused Maathai of inciting women and encouraging them to strip at Freedom Corner, urging that she not be allowed to speak at the summit. Despite this, Maathai was chosen to be a chief spokesperson at the summit.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp.  226–228.</ref>

===Push for democracy===
During the first multi-party [[1992 Kenyan general election|election of Kenya, in 1992]], Maathai strove to unite the opposition and for fair elections in Kenya. The Forum for the Restoration of Democracy (FORD) had fractured into [[FORD-Kenya]] (led by [[Oginga Odinga]]) and [[FORD-Asili]] (led by [[Kenneth Matiba]]); former [[Vice-President of Kenya|vice president]] [[Mwai Kibaki]] had left the ruling [[Kenya African National Union]] (KANU) party, and formed the [[Democratic Party (Kenya)|Democratic Party]]. Maathai and many others believed such a fractured opposition would lead to KANU's retaining control of the country, so they formed the Middle Ground Group in an effort to unite the opposition. Maathai was chosen to serve as its chairperson. Also during the election, Maathai and like-minded opposition members formed the Movement for Free and Fair Elections. Despite their efforts, the opposition did not unite, and the ruling KANU party used intimidation and state-held media to win the election, retaining control of parliament.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 230–235.</ref>
{{Quote box|salign=center|width=300px|align=right|quote=It is often difficult to describe to those who live in a free society what life is like in an authoritarian regime. You don't know who to trust. You worry that you, your family, or your friends will be arrested and jailed without due process. The fear of political violence or death, whether through direct assassinations or targeted "accidents", is constant. Such was the case in Kenya, especially during the 1990s.|source=Wangarĩ Muta Maathai – ''Unbowed'', p. 206.}}

The following year, ethnic clashes occurred throughout Kenya. Maathai believed they were incited by the government, who had warned of stark consequences to [[multi-party democracy]]. Maathai travelled with friends and the press to areas of violence in order to encourage them to cease fighting. With the Green Belt Movement she planted "trees of peace", but before long her actions were opposed by the government. The conflict areas were labeled as "no go zones", and in February 1993 the president claimed that Maathai had masterminded a distribution of leaflets inciting [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyus]] to attack [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjins]]. After her friend and supporter Dr. Makanga was kidnapped, Maathai chose to go into hiding. While in hiding, Maathai was invited to a meeting in Tokyo of the [[Green Cross International]], an environmental organisation recently founded by former Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. When Maathai responded that she could not attend as she did not believe the government would allow her to leave the country and she was in hiding, Gorbachev pressured the government of Kenya to allow her to travel freely. President arap Moi denied limiting her travel, and she was allowed to leave the country, although too late for the meeting in Tokyo. Maathai was again recognized internationally, and she flew to Scotland to receive the Edinburgh Medal in April 1993. In May she went to Chicago to receive the [[Jane Addams]] International Women's Leadership Award, and in June she attended the UN's [[World Conference on Human Rights]] in Vienna.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 235–252.</ref>

During the [[1997 Kenyan general election|elections of 1997]], Maathai again wished to unite the opposition in order to defeat the ruling party. In November, less than two months before the election, she decided to run for parliament and for president as a candidate of the [[Mazingira Green Party of Kenya|Liberal Party]]. Her intentions were widely questioned in the press; many believed she should simply stick to running the Green Belt Movement and stay out of politics. On the day of the election, a rumour that Maathai had withdrawn from the election and endorsed another candidate was printed in the media. Maathai garnered few votes and lost the election.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 254–259.</ref>

In the summer of 1998, Maathai learned of a government plan to privatize large areas of public land in the Karura Forest, just outside Nairobi, and give it to political supporters. Maathai protested this through letters to the government and the press. She went with the Green Belt Movement to Karura Forest, planting trees and protesting the destruction of the forest. On 8 January 1999, a group of protesters including Maathai, six opposition MPs, journalists, international observers, and Green Belt members and supporters returned to the forest to plant a tree in protest. The entry to the forest was guarded by a large group of men. When she tried to plant a tree in an area that had been designated to be cleared for a golf course, the group was attacked. Many of the protesters were injured, including Maathai, four MPs, some of the journalists, and German environmentalists. When she reported the attack to the police, they refused to return with her to the forest to arrest her attackers. However, the attack had been filmed by Maathai's supporters, and the event provoked international outrage.<ref name="Ecologist"/><ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 261–270.</ref> Student protests broke out throughout Nairobi, and some of these groups were violently broken up by the police. Protests continued until 16 August 1999, when the president announced that he was banning all allocation of public land.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 270–271.</ref>

In 2001, the government again planned to take public forest land and give it to its supporters. While protesting this and collecting [[petition]] signatures on 7 March 2001, in Wang'uru village near [[Mount Kenya]], Maathai was again arrested. The following day, following international and popular protest at her arrest, she was released without being charged. On 7 July 2001, shortly after planting trees at Freedom Corner in Uhuru Park in Nairobi to commemorate [[Saba Saba Day]], Maathai was again arrested. Later that evening, she was again released without being charged.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 280–284.</ref> In January 2002, Maathai returned to teaching as the Dorothy McCluskey Visiting Fellow for Conservation at the [[Yale University]]'s [[Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies|School of Forestry and Environmental Studies]]. She remained there until June 2002, teaching a course on sustainable development focused on the work of the Green Belt Movement.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 284–285.</ref>

===Election to parliament===
[[File:Wangari Maathai social forum.jpg|thumb|left|Wangari Maathai speaks about deforestation]]
Upon her return to Kenya, Maathai again campaigned for parliament in the [[2002 Kenyan general election|2002 elections]], this time as a candidate of the [[National Rainbow Coalition]], the umbrella organisation which finally united the opposition. On 27 December 2002, the Rainbow Coalition defeated the ruling party [[Kenya African National Union]], and in [[Tetu Constituency]] Maathai won with an overwhelming 98% of the vote.<ref>''Unbowed'', pp. 286–289.</ref> In January 2003, she was appointed Assistant Minister in the Ministry for Environment and Natural Resources and served in that capacity until November 2005.<ref name="UNCCD"/> She founded the [[Mazingira Green Party of Kenya]] in 2003 to allow candidates to run on a platform of conservation as embodied by the Green Belt Movement. It is a member of the [[Federation of Green Parties of Africa]] and the [[Global Greens]].<ref>''Unbowed'', p. 260.</ref>

Through her significant efforts, Wangari Maathai became the first African woman, and the first environmentalist, to win the Peace Prize.

==AIDS conspiracy theory==
Controversy arose when it was reported by Kenyan newspaper ''[[The Standard (Kenya)|The Standard]]'' that Maathai had claimed HIV/AIDS was "[[Operation INFEKTION|deliberately created by Western scientists]] to decimate the African population."<ref name="rferl.org">{{cite web|last=Sindelar|first=Daisy|url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2004/12/bf4adbd1-fba8-4ae6-b68b-fa5bcb171f1a.html|title=World: Africa's First Female Nobel Peace Laureate Accepts Award Amid Controversy Over AIDS stupidRemarks|publisher=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=10 December 2004|access-date=28 September 2011}}</ref> Maathai denied making the allegations, but ''The Standard'' has stood by its reports.<ref name="rferl.org"/>

In a 2004 interview with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, in response to questions concerning that report, Maathai replied: "I have no idea who created AIDS and whether it is a biological agent or not. But I do know things like that don't come from the moon. I have always thought that it is important to tell people the truth, but I guess there is some truth that must not be too exposed," and when asked what she meant, she continued, "I'm referring to AIDS. I am sure people know where it came from. And I'm quite sure it did not come from the monkeys."<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070312045031/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901041018-713166,00.html "10 Questions: Wangari Maathai"].

These prevalent beliefs in my region have led to an upsurge in rape and violence against children. It is within this context, also complicated by the cultural and religious perspective, that I often speak. I have therefore been shocked by the ongoing debate generated by what I am purported to have said. It is therefore critical for me to state that I neither say nor believe that the virus was developed by white people or white powers in order to destroy the African people.

In August 2006, then [[United States Senator]] [[Barack Obama]] traveled to Kenya. His father was educated in America through the same  program as Maathai. She and the Senator met and planted a tree together in Uhuru Park in Nairobi. Obama called for freedom of the press to be respected, saying, "Press freedom is like tending a garden; it continually has to be nurtured and cultivated. The citizenry has to value it because it's one of those things that can slip away if we're not vigilant." He deplored global ecological losses, singling out President [[George W. Bush]]'s refusal to join the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) and its subsidiary, the [[Kyoto Protocol]].<ref>[https://archive.today/20130422011933/http://www.mg.co.za/article/2006-08-28-obama-press-freedom-is-like-tending-a-garden Obama: 'Press freedom is like tending a garden'].
