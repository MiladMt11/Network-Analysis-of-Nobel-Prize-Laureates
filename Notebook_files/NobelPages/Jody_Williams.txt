'''Jody Williams''' (born October 9, 1950) is an American political activist known for her work in banning [[Anti-personnel mine|anti-personnel]] [[Land mine|landmine]]s, her [[human rights defender|defense of human rights]] (especially those of [[Women's rights|women]]), and her efforts to promote new understandings of [[security]] in today's world. She was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1997<ref name=":0" /> for her work toward the banning and clearing of anti-personnel mines.

== Education ==
Williams earned a [[Master of International Affairs|Master in International Relations]] from the [[Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies]] (a division of [[Johns Hopkins University]]) in [[Washington, D.C.]] (1984), an [[Master of Arts|MA]] in teaching Spanish and [[English as a second or foreign language|English]] as a second language from the [[School for International Training]] (SIT) in [[Brattleboro, Vermont|Brattleboro]], [[Vermont]] (1976), and a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from the [[University of Vermont]] (1972).

== Advocacy ==
Williams served as the founding coordinator of the [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]] (ICBL) from early 1992 until February 1998. Before that work, she spent eleven years on various projects related to the wars in Nicaragua and El Salvador, where, according to the ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights'', she "spent the 1980s performing life-threatening human rights work."<ref>[[Ken Rutherford (political scientist)|Ken Rutherford]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=1QbX90fmCVUC&q=landmines#v=onepage&q=Jody%20Williams&f=false "Landmines," ''Encyclopedia of Human Rights:'' Vol. 1. David P. Forsythe, ed. Oxford University Press, 2009; p. 395] {{ISBN|0195334027}}</ref>

In an unprecedented cooperative effort with governments, UN bodies and the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], Williams served as a chief strategist and spokesperson for the ICBL, which she developed from two [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) with a staff of one – herself – to an international powerhouse of 1,300 NGOs in ninety countries.

From its small beginning and official launch in 1992, Williams and the ICBL dramatically achieved the campaign's goal of an international treaty banning antipersonnel landmines during a diplomatic conference held in Oslo in September 1997. The [[Ottawa Treaty]] that banned land-mines is credited to her and the ICBL.<ref name=":0">{{Nobelprize|name=Jody Williams|accessdate=2020-10-11}}</ref> Three weeks later, she and the ICBL were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. At that time, she became the tenth woman – and third American woman – in its almost hundred-year history to receive the Prize.  
 
In November 2004, after discussions with Iranian Peace Laureates Dr. [[Shirin Ebadi]] and Professor [[Wangari Maathai]] of Kenya, Williams established the Nobel Women’s Initiative which was launched in January 2006. Williams has since served as its Chair. This initiative brought together six of the female Peace Laureates, the women seek to use their influence to promote the work of women working for peace with justice and equality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nobelwomensinitiative.org/|title=Nobel Women's Initiative|website=Nobel Women's Initiative|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-07}}</ref> ([[Aung San Suu Kyi]] is an honorary member.)

In 2020, Williams called upon [[Chevron corporation]] to pay cleanup costs to the residents of the [[Lago Agrio oil field]] which were awarded in 2011 and have been in litigation ever since.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2020/08/how-did-a-lawyer-who-took-on-big-oil-and-won-end-up-under-house-arrest/|title=How did a lawyer who took on big oil and won end up under house arrest?|first=Rex|last=Weyler|publisher=Mother Jones|year=2020|access-date=2020-09-09}}</ref>

Williams is quoted as saying, "The image of peace with a dove flying over a rainbow and people holding hands singing kumbaya ends up infantilizing people who believe that sustainable peace is possible. If you think that singing and looking at a rainbow will suddenly make peace appear then you're not capable of meaningful thought, or understanding the difficulties of the world."<ref>an interview with ''Real Leaders'' magazine in 2015</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Jody Williams Admits, "I'm No Mother Theresa."|url=http://real-leaders.com/nobel-peace-laureate-jody-williams-admits-im-no-mother-theresa/|website=Real Leaders|language=en-US}}</ref>
