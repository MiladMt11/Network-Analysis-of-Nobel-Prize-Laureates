'''Fredrik Bajer''' (21 April 1837 – 22 January 1922) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] writer, teacher, and [[pacifism|pacifist]] [[politician]] who received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1908 together with [[Klas Pontus Arnoldson]].

==Life==
He was son of a clergyman born in Næstved in 1837. Bajer served as an officer in the Danish army, fighting in the [[Second Schleswig War|1864 war]] against [[Prussia]] and [[Austria]] where he was promoted to the rank of first lieutenant. He was discharged in 1865, and moved to Copenhagen where he became a teacher, translator and writer.

He entered the [[Rigsdag|Danish Parliament]] in 1872 as a member of [[Parliament of Denmark|Folketinget]] and held a seat there for the following 23 years. As a member of parliament, he worked for the use of international arbitration to solve conflicts among nations, and it is due to Bajer's efforts that foreign relations became part of the work of the Danish Parliament and that Denmark participated in the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] from the beginning and earned a distinguished position among its members.<ref>Skou, Kaare R.
