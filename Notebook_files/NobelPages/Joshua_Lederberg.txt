He was 33 years old when he won the 1958 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for discovering that [[bacteria]] can mate and exchange genes ([[bacterial conjugation]]).<ref>[[Kevin Warwick|Warwick, K]]. "The Joshua Lederberg Papers: Profiles in Science, National Library of Medicine", Biography, Volume 24, Number 4, Fall 2001, pp. 978-982</ref> He shared the prize with [[Edward Tatum]] and [[George Beadle]], who won for their work with genetics.

In addition to his contributions to [[biology]], Lederberg did extensive research in [[artificial intelligence]]. This included work in the [[NASA]] experimental programs seeking [[life on Mars]] and the [[chemistry]] [[expert system]] [[Dendral]].

==Early life and education==
Lederberg was born in [[Montclair, New Jersey]], to a [[Jewish]] family, son of Esther Goldenbaum Schulman Lederberg and [[Rabbi]] Zvi Hirsch Lederberg, in 1925, and moved to [[Washington Heights, Manhattan]] as an infant.<ref>Broad, William J. [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/us/05lederberg.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/D/Deaths%20(Obituaries)&pagewanted=all "Joshua Lederberg, 82, a Nobel Winner, Dies"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 5, 2008. Accessed October 29 , 2018. "Dr. Lederberg was born May 23, 1925, in Montclair, N.J., to Zvi Hirsch Lederberg, a rabbi, and the former Esther Goldenbaum, who had emigrated from what is now Israel two years earlier. His family moved to the Washington Heights section of Manhattan when he was 6 months old."</ref> He had two younger brothers. Lederberg graduated from [[Stuyvesant High School]] in [[New York City]] at the age of 15 in 1941.<ref name="Nobel">{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1958/lederberg-bio.html |title=Joshua Lederberg - The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1958 - Biography | year=1958 |access-date=2007-10-31}}</ref> After graduation, he was allowed lab space as part of the American Institute Science Laboratory, a forerunner of the [[Westinghouse Science Talent Search]]. He enrolled in [[Columbia University]] in 1941, majoring in zoology. Under the mentorship of Francis J. Ryan, he conducted biochemical and genetic studies on the bread mold ''[[Neurospora crassa]]''. Intending to receive his MD and fulfill his military service obligations, Lederberg worked as a hospital corpsman during 1943 in the clinical pathology laboratory at St. Albans Naval Hospital, where he examined sailors' blood and stool samples for [[malaria]]. He went on to receive his undergraduate degree in 1944.

==Bacterial genetics==
Joshua Lederberg began medical studies at Columbia's [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons|College of Physicians and Surgeons]] while continuing to perform experiments. Inspired by [[Oswald Avery]]'s [[Avery-MacLeod-McCarty experiment|discovery]] of the importance of [[DNA]], Lederberg began to investigate his hypothesis that, contrary to prevailing opinion, bacteria did not simply pass down exact copies of genetic information, making all cells in a lineage essentially [[Cloning|clones]]. After making little progress at Columbia, Lederberg wrote to [[Edward Tatum]], Ryan's post-doctoral mentor, proposing a collaboration. In 1946 and 1947, Lederberg took a leave of absence to study under the mentorship of Tatum at [[Yale University]]. Lederberg and Tatum showed that the [[bacterium]] ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' entered a sexual phase during which it could share genetic information through [[bacterial conjugation]].<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Lederberg | first1 = J. | author-link = Joshua Lederberg| last2 = Tatum | first2 = E.

Instead of returning to Columbia to finish his medical degree, Lederberg chose to accept an offer of an assistant professorship in genetics at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. His wife [[Esther Lederberg]] went with him to Wisconsin. She received her doctorate there in 1950.

Joshua Lederberg and [[Norton Zinder]] showed in 1951 that genetic material could be transferred from one strain of the bacterium ''Salmonella typhimurium'' to another using viral material as an intermediary step.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21760/|title=Transduction|first1=Anthony JF|last1=Griffiths|first2=Jeffrey H.|last2=Miller|first3=David T.|last3=Suzuki|first4=Richard C.|last4=Lewontin|first5=William M.|last5=Gelbart|date=28 September 2018|journal=An Introduction to Genetic Analysis. 7th Edition|via=www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov}}</ref>  This process is called [[Transduction (genetics)|transduction]].

}}</ref> The research in specialized transduction focused upon lambda phage infection of ''E. coli''. Transduction and specialized transduction explained how bacteria of different species could gain resistance to the same [[antibiotic]] very quickly.

During her time in Joshua Lederberg's laboratory, [[Esther Lederberg]] also discovered fertility factor F, later publishing with Joshua Lederberg and [[Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza]]. In 1956, the Society of Illinois Bacteriologists simultaneously awarded Joshua Lederberg and Esther Lederberg the Pasteur Medal, for "their outstanding contributions to the fields of microbiology and genetics".

In 1957, Joshua Lederberg founded the Department of Medical Genetics at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]]. He has held visiting professorship in Bacteriology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in summer 1950<ref>{{cite web|title=University of Wisconsin-Madison Archives Oral History Project (Joshua Lederberg)|url=https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/ps/access/BBBDHF.pdf|publisher=U.S. National Library of Medicine|access-date=5 April 2018}}</ref> and [[University of Melbourne]] (1957). Also in 1957, he was elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]].<ref name="Nobel"/>

[[Gustav Nossal|Sir Gustav Nossal]] views Lederberg as his mentor, describing him as "lightning fast" and "loving a robust debate."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.findmypathway.com/blog/sir-gustav-nossal-immunologist-interview/|title=Sir Gustav Nossal in Forging the Path - A Find My Pathway Interview|date=30 October 2018|website=Find My Pathway}}</ref>

==Post Nobel Prize research==
[[Image:Joshua Lederberg and George Bush.jpg|240px|thumb|right|Lederberg (right) receiving The National Medal of Science from George H. W. Bush.]]
In 1958, Joshua Lederberg received the Nobel Prize and moved to [[Stanford University]], where he was the founder and chairman of the Department of Genetics. He collaborated with [[Frank Macfarlane Burnet]] to study viral antibodies. With the launching of ''[[Sputnik]]'' in 1957, Lederberg became concerned about the biological impact of space exploration. In a letter to the [[National Academies of Sciences]], he outlined his concerns that extraterrestrial microbes might gain entry to Earth onboard spacecraft, causing catastrophic diseases. He also argued that, conversely, microbial contamination of manmade satellites and probes may obscure the search for extraterrestrial life. He advised quarantine for returning astronauts and equipment and sterilization of equipment prior to launch. Teaming up with [[Carl Sagan]], his public advocacy for what he termed [[exobiology]] helped expand the role of biology in NASA.<ref>{{cite news |last=Scharf |first= Caleb |url=http://nautil.us/issue/32/space/how-the-cold-war-created-astrobiology-rp |title=How the Cold War Created Astrobiology |work=Nautilus |date=January 21, 2016 |access-date=2016-01-24 }}</ref>

In the 1960s, he collaborated with [[Edward Feigenbaum]] in Stanford's computer science department to develop [[Dendral|DENDRAL]].

In 1978, he became the president of [[Rockefeller University]], until he stepped down in 1990 and became professor-[[emeritus]] of [[bioinformatics|molecular genetics and informatics]] at Rockefeller University, reflecting his extensive research and publications in these disciplines.<ref name="OH1992">{{cite web|author=Center for Oral History| title= Joshua Lederberg |url=https://oh.sciencehistory.org/oral-histories/lederberg-joshua|website= [[Science History Institute]] }}</ref><ref name="OH2000">{{cite web|author=Center for Oral History| title= Joshua Lederberg |url=https://oh.sciencehistory.org/oral-histories/lederberg-joshua-0|website= [[Science History Institute]] }}</ref>

Throughout his career, Lederberg was active as a scientific advisor to the U.S. government. Starting in 1950, he was a member of various panels of the Presidential Science Advisory Committee. In 1979, he became a member of the U.S. [[Defense Science Board]] and the chairman of President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s President's Cancer Panel. In 1989, he received [[National Medal of Science]] for his contributions to the scientific world. In 1994, he headed the Department of Defense's Task Force on Persian Gulf War Health Effects, which investigated [[Gulf War Syndrome]].

During a 1986 fact finding mission of the 1979 [[Soviet Union]] epidemic of [[anthrax bacteria]] that killed 66 people in the city of Sverdlovsk, Russia now named [[Yakaterinberg]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/sverdlovsk-anthrax-leak|title=Sverdlovsk anthrax leak}}</ref><ref>https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/08/anthrax-genome-reveals-secrets-about-soviet-bioweapons-accident {{Bare URL inline|date=November 2021}}</ref> Lederberg sided with Soviets that the anthrax outbreak was from animal to human transmission stating, “Wild rumors do spread around every epidemic." “The current Soviet account is very likely to be true."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/101584906X18717|title = Readonly NLM-id ssim: 101584906X18717 - Joshua Lederberg - Profiles in Science Search Results}}</ref>
After the fall of the Soviet Union and subsequent US investigations in the early 1990's a team of scientists confirmed the outbreak was caused by a release of an aerosol of anthrax pathogen from a nearby military facility, the lab leak is one of the deadliest ever ever documented.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/20/world/europe/coronavirus-lab-anthrax.html|title = Soviets Once Denied a Deadly Anthrax Lab Leak.
