== Biography ==
Hofstadter was born into a Jewish family<ref>{{cite news|title=Dr. Robert Hofstadter, U.S. Jewish Scientist, Wins 1961 Nobel Prize|url=http://www.jta.org/1961/11/03/archive/dr-robert-hofstadter-u-s-jewish-scientist-wins-1961-nobel-prize|access-date=October 20, 2013|newspaper=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]|date=November 3, 1961}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Robert Hofstadter biography|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/318/000072102/|publisher=NNDB|access-date=October 20, 2013}}</ref> in New York City on February 5, 1915, to Polish immigrants, Louis Hofstadter, a salesman, and [[née]] Henrietta Koenigsberg.<ref>{{cite web|title=Guide to the Robert Hofstadter Papers |url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt458037nx/entire_text/|access-date=November 5, 2014}}</ref> He attended elementary and high schools in New York City and entered [[City College of New York]], graduating with a B.S. degree ''[[magna cum laude]]'' in 1935 at the age of 20, and was awarded the Kenyon Prize in Mathematics and Physics.  He also received a Charles A. Coffin Foundation Fellowship from the [[General Electric Company]], which enabled him to attend graduate school at [[Princeton University]], where he earned his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees at the age of 23.<ref>{{cite book|title=Robert Hofstadter biography|url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10169&page=161|access-date=November 5, 2014|doi = 10.17226/10169|year = 2001|isbn = 978-0-309-07572-5}}</ref> His doctoral dissertation was titled "Infra-red absorption by light and heavy formic and acetic acids."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hofstadter|first=Robert|url=https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/2123975|title=Infra-red absorption by light and heavy formic and acetic acids|date=1938|publisher=Princeton|language=en}}</ref> He did his post-doctoral research at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and was an assistant professor at Princeton before joining [[Stanford University]].  Hofstadter taught at Stanford from 1950 to 1985.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

In 1942 he married Nancy Givan (1920–2007), a native of [[Baltimore]].<ref>[http://news.stanford.edu/pr/2007/pr-nancy-082207.html Obituary to Nancy Givan] from Stanford University, 2007.</ref>  They had three children: Laura, Molly (who was disabled and not able to communicate),<ref>[https://prelectur.stanford.edu/lecturers/hofstadter/autolipography.html Douglas Hofstadter's autobiography]</ref> and [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winner [[Douglas Hofstadter]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010628061939/http://stills.nap.edu/html/biomems/rhofstadter.html National Academy of Sciences biography]</ref>

==Opus==
===Thallium-activated sodium iodide gamma ray detector===
In 1948 Hofstadter filed a patent on this for the detection of [[ionizing radiation]] by this crystal.<ref>{{US patent reference|number=2585551|title=Means for detecting ionizing radiations|inventor=Robert Hofstadter}}</ref><ref>[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=10169&page=163 "Robert Hofstadter"] ''Biographical Memoirs'' National Academy of Sciences</ref>  These detectors are widely used for gamma ray detection to this day.

===Coining of the fermi (unit) and 1961 Nobel Lecture===

Robert Hofstadter coined the term [[fermi (unit)|fermi]], symbol '''fm''',<ref>{{cite journal

in honor of the Italian [[physicist]] [[Enrico Fermi]] (1901–1954), one of the founders of nuclear physics, in Hofstadter's 1956 paper published in the ''[[Reviews of Modern Physics]]'' journal, "Electron Scattering and Nuclear Structure".<ref>Hofstadter, Robert, Department of Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, California, [http://rmp.aps.org/abstract/RMP/v28/i3/p214_1 "Electron Scattering and Nuclear Structure"], ''Rev.

When Hofstadter was awarded the 1961 Nobel Prize in Physics, it subsequently appears in the text of his 1961 Nobel Lecture, "The electron-scattering method and its application to the structure of nuclei and nucleons" (December 11, 1961).<ref name="Nobel"/>

===Compton Gamma Ray Observatory and EGRET Telescope===
In his last few years, Hofstadter became interested in [[astrophysics]] and applied his knowledge of [[scintillator]]s to the design of the [[Energetic Gamma Ray Experiment Telescope|EGRET]] [[gamma-ray telescope]] of the [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] named for fellow Nobel Laureate in Physics (1927), [[Arthur Holly Compton]]. [[Stanford University]]'s Department of Physics credits Hofstadter with being "one of the principal scientists who developed the Compton Observatory."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Hofstadter Memorial Lectures|url=http://www.stanford.edu/dept/physics/events/hofstadter2004.html|publisher=Stanford University|access-date=December 7, 2013}}</ref>
