'''Robert Francis Furchgott''' (June 4, 1916 &ndash; May 19, 2009) was a [[Nobel Prize]]-winning [[United States|American]] [[biochemist]] who contributed to the discovery of nitric oxide as a transient cellular signal in [[mammal]]ian systems.

==Early life and education==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2015}}
Furchgott was born in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], to Arthur Furchgott (December 1884 &ndash; January 1971), a department store owner, and Pena (Sorentrue) Furchgott.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} He graduated with a degree in chemistry  from the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] (1937),{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} and went on to earn a [[Ph.D]] in biochemistry at [[Northwestern University]] (1940),{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} immediately joining a medical faculty thereafter.

Furchgott was faculty member of [[Cornell University Medical College]] from 1940 to 1949,{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} of [[Washington University School of Medicine]] from 1949 to 1956,{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} and [[State University of New York Downstate Medical Center]] from 1956 to 2009, as professor of [[pharmacology]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In 1978, Furchgott discovered a substance in [[endothelium|endothelial cells]] that relaxes [[blood vessel]]s, calling it [[endothelium-derived relaxing factor]] (EDRF).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Furchgott|first=Robert F.|last2=Zawadzki|first2=John V.|date=November 1980|title=The obligatory role of endothelial cells in the relaxation of arterial smooth muscle by acetylcholine|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/288373a0|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=288|issue=5789|pages=373–376|doi=10.1038/288373a0|issn=0028-0836}}</ref> By 1986, he had worked out EDRF's nature and mechanism of action,{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} and determined that EDRF was in fact [[nitric oxide]] (NO),{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} an important compound in many aspects of cardiovascular physiology.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} This research is important in explaining a wide variety of neuronal, cardiovascular, and general physiologic processes of central importance in human health and disease.<ref name="Nobel">{{cite web |title=Summary: The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1998 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1998/press-release |website=NobelPrize.org. |publisher=Nobel Media AB 2020 |access-date= 4 January 2020}}</ref>

Furchgott, who was Jewish,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fau.edu/library/nobel34.htm |title=Seymour "Sy" Brody's |publisher=Fau.edu |access-date=2015-08-11}}</ref> lived for most of his married and career life in [[Woodmere, NY]] (Long Island). He was married to Lenore Mandelbaum (February 1915 &ndash; April 1983)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi |title=RootsWeb: Database Index |publisher=Ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com |access-date=2015-08-11}}</ref> from 1941 until she died aged 68. They had three daughters: Jane, Terry and Susan. His daughter, Susan, was a prolific artist in the San Francisco counter culture and a co-founder of the [[Kerista Commune]] (she was also known as "Even Eve" and "Eve Furchgott"). Robert Furchgott spent his later years with Margaret Gallagher Roth, who died March 14, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E1DB143AF934A25750C0A9609C8B63 |title=Paid Notice - Deaths ROTH, MARGARET - Paid Death Notice - NYTimes.com |work=New York Times |date=2006-03-17 |access-date=2015-08-11}}</ref> He served as a professor emeritus at the [[State University of New York Downstate Medical Center]]. In 2008 he moved to Seattle's Ravenna neighborhood. Furchgott died on May 19, 2009<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.downstate.edu |title=SUNY Downstate Medical Center |publisher=Downstate.edu |access-date=2015-08-11}}</ref> in Seattle. He is survived by his three daughters, four grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
