He held academic positions, wrote many medical articles and also served in several legislative and diplomatic posts in the Portuguese government. In 1911 he became professor of neurology in Lisbon until his retirement in 1944.

== Early life and training ==
Moniz was born in [[Avanca]], [[Estarreja]], Portugal, as '''António Caetano de Abreu Freire de Resende'''. He attended Escola do Padre José Ramos and the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]]-run [[:pt:Colégio de São Fiel|College of Saint Fidelis]] and studied medicine at the [[University of Coimbra]], graduating in 1899. For the next 12 years, he served as a lecturer for basic medical courses at Coimbra. In 1911, he became a neurology professor at the University of Lisbon, where he worked until his retirement in 1944.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Tierney|first=Ann Jane|date=2000-04-01|title=Egas Moniz and the Origins of Psychosurgery: A Review Commemorating the 50th Anniversary of Moniz's Nobel Prize|journal=Journal of the History of the Neurosciences|volume=9|issue=1|pages=22–36|doi=10.1076/0964-704X(200004)9:1;1-2;FT022|issn=0964-704X|pmid=11232345|s2cid=12482874}}</ref>

His uncle and godfather, Father Caetano de Pina Resende Abreu e Sá Freire, convinced his family to change his surname to Egas Moniz since he was convinced that the Resende family was descended from medieval nobleman [[Egas Moniz o Aio]].

== Politics ==
Politics was an early passion for Moniz. He supported a republican government, diverging from his family's support for the monarchy. As a student activist, he was jailed on two separate occasions for participating in demonstrations. While serving as Dean of the Medical School at the University of Lisbon, he was arrested a third time for preventing police from settling a student-run protest.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Siang Yong|last2=Yip|first2=Angela|date=2017-04-21|title=António Egas Moniz (1874–1955): Lobotomy pioneer and Nobel laureate|journal=Singapore Medical Journal|volume=55|issue=4|pages=175–76|doi=10.11622/smedj.2014048|issn=0037-5675|pmc=4291941|pmid=24763831}}</ref>

Moniz's formal political career began when he was elected to parliament in 1900. During World War I, he was appointed the Ambassador to Spain, and afterward, he became Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1917, and in 1918 led the Portuguese delegation to the [[Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920)|Versailles Peace Conference]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=Nobel-01a>{{cite news|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1949/moniz/biographical/|title=Egas Moniz – Biographical|publisher=nobelprize.org|author=|date=|accessdate=26 February 2021|quote=Moniz entered politics in 1903 and served as a Deputy in the Portuguese Parliament until 1917 when he became Portuguese Ambassador to Spain.

== Research ==
=== Cerebral angiography ===
[[File:Retrato do Prof. Egas Moniz (1932) - José Malhoa (Hospital de Santa Maria).png|thumb|Portrait of Egas Moniz in the doctoral regalia of the [[University of Coimbra]], 1932, by [[José Malhoa]]]]
In 1926, at age 51, Moniz retired from politics{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} and returned to medicine full-time. He hypothesized that visualizing blood vessels in the brain with radiographic means would allow for more precise localization of brain tumors. During his experiments, Moniz injected radiopaque dyes into brain arteries and took X-rays to visualize abnormalities. In his initial tests, Moniz used strontium and lithium bromide in three patients with a suspected tumor, epilepsy, and Parkinsonism, but the experiment failed and one patient died. In the next set of trials, he achieved success using 25% sodium iodide solution on three patients, developing the first cerebral angiogram.<ref name=":1" />

Moniz presented his findings at the Neurological Society in Paris and the French Academy of Medicine in 1927. He was the first person to successfully visualize the brain using radiopaque substances, as previous scientists had only visualized peripheral structures. He also contributed to the development of [[Thorotrast]] for use in the procedure and delivered many lectures and papers on the subject.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tondreau|first=R L|title=The retrospectoscope. Egas Moniz 1874–1955|journal=RadioGraphics|volume=5|issue=6|pages=994–97|doi=10.1148/radiographics.5.6.3916824|pmid=3916824|year=1985}}</ref> His work led to the use of angiography to detect internal carotid occlusion, as well as two Nobel Prize nominations in this area.<ref name=":1" />

=== Prefrontal leucotomy ===
Moniz thought that mental illness originated from abnormal neural connections in the frontal lobe. He described a "fixation of synapses," which in mental illness, was expressed as "predominant, obsessive ideas." Moniz also referenced the experiments of Yale physiologists John Fulton and C.F. Jacobsen, who found that removing the frontal lobes of a chimpanzee made it calmer and more cooperative. In addition, Moniz observed "changes in character and personality" among soldiers who had suffered from injuries to their frontal lobes.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last1=Gross|first1=Dominik|last2=Schäfer|first2=Gereon|date=2011-02-01|title=Egas Moniz (1874–1955) and the "invention" of modern psychosurgery: a historical and ethical reanalysis under special consideration of Portuguese original sources|journal=Neurosurgical Focus|volume=30|issue=2|pages=E8|doi=10.3171/2010.10.FOCUS10214|pmid=21284454}}</ref>

Moniz hypothesized that surgically removing white matter fibers from the frontal lobe would improve a patient's mental illness. He enlisted his long-time staff member and neurosurgeon Almeida Lima to test the procedure on a group of 20 patients, mainly with schizophrenia, anxiety, and depression. The surgeries took place under general anesthesia. The first psychosurgery was performed in 1935 on a 63-year-old woman with depression, anxiety, paranoia, hallucinations, and insomnia. The patient experienced a rapid physical recovery, and two months later, a psychiatrist noted that she was calmer, less paranoid, and well oriented. In the first set of surgeries, Moniz reported a total of seven cures, seven improvements, and six unchanged cases.<ref name=":0" />

Moniz never performed a surgery himself, partially because of his lack of neurosurgical training but also because he suffered from severe gout that left his hands crippled.<ref name=":0" /> Instructed by Moniz, Lima performed ten of the first twenty surgeries by injecting absolute alcohol to destroy the frontal lobe.<ref name=":2" /> Later on, Moniz and Lima developed a new technique using a leucotome, a needle-like instrument with a retractable wire loop.<ref name=":1" /> By rotating the wire loop, they were able to surgically separate white matter fibres.<ref name=":2" />

Moniz judged the results acceptable in the first 40 or so patients he treated, claiming, "Prefrontal leukotomy is a simple operation, always safe, which may prove to be an effective surgical treatment in certain cases of mental disorder."<ref name="Jansson">{{cite web|last=Jansson|first=Bengt|title=Controversial Psychosurgery Resulted in a Nobel Prize|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1949/moniz-article.html|access-date=11 July 2010|publisher=Nobelprize.org}}</ref> He also claimed that any behavioral and personality deterioration that may occur was outweighed by reduction in the debilitating effects of the illness.<ref name="Jansson" /><ref name="Diefenbach">{{cite journal|url=http://facstaff.unca.edu/ddiefenb/lobotomy.html |title=Portrayal of Lobotomy in the Popular Press: 1935–1960 |last=Diefenbach |first=Gretchen J |publisher=unca.ed |author2=Donald Diefenbach |author3=Alan Baumeister |author4=Mark West |journal=Journal of the History of the Neurosciences |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=60–69 |access-date=11 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323015412/http://facstaff.unca.edu/ddiefenb/lobotomy.html |archive-date=23 March 2010 |pmid=11624138 |year=1999 |doi=10.1076/jhin.8.1.60.1766 }}</ref> He conceded that patients who had already deteriorated from the mental illness did not benefit much.

Critics accused Moniz of understating complications, providing inadequate documentation, and not following up with patients. After his initial procedures, other physicians, such as [[Walter Jackson Freeman II]] and [[James W. Watts]], adopted a modified technique in the United States and renamed it "lobotomy."<ref name=":1" />

== Writing ==
Moniz was a prolific writer, publishing work in Portuguese literature, sexology, and two autobiographies. Upon graduating from medical school, he gained notoriety for publishing a series of controversial books, called ''A Vida Sexual'' (The Sexual Life). His other writings included biographies of Portuguese physician [[Pope John XXI|Pedro Hispano Portucalense]] and [[Abbé Faria|José Custódio de Faria]], a monk and hypnotist. In the field of medicine, Moniz published 112 articles and 2 books on angiography alone. He also wrote on neurological war injuries, Parkinson's disease, and clinical neurology.<ref name=":1" />

== Later life and death ==
In 1939, Moniz was shot multiple times by a patient suffering from schizophrenia and subsequently used a wheelchair.{{efn|
It is often said that this was one of Moniz's lobotomy patients, but there seems to be no evidence for this.{{refn|{{cite book

He continued in private practice until 1955. Moniz died from an internal haemorrhage on 13 December 1955.<ref name=":1" />

In his native Portugal, Moniz is highly regarded,<ref name=":2" /> being featured on commemorative banknotes and postage stamps. A statue of him stands outside the Faculty of Medicine of the [[University of Lisbon]], and his country house in [[Avanca]] is now a museum.

In 2020, a [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[Television film|made-for-television film]] was produced by [[RTP2]] titled ''O Ego de Egas'' ("The [[Egotism|Ego]] of Egas"), which explores Moniz's work and motives.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Neto|first=Ricardo|title='O Ego do Egas': O Telefilme que promete contar a história de Egas Moniz|url=https://www.fantastictv.pt/2020/11/o-ego-do-egas-o-telefilme-que-promete.html|access-date=2021-03-29|website=Fantastic – Mais do que Televisão}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Egas Moniz é uma figura polémica e essas pessoas tendem a dar boas histórias|url=https://www.nit.pt/cultura/televisao/egas-moniz-e-uma-figura-polemica-e-essas-pessoas-tendem-dar-boas-historias|access-date=2021-03-29|website=NiT|language=pt-PT}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Santos|first=José Carlos|title=O Ego de Egas|date=2020-12-31|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt13334948/|type=Biography, Drama|others=João Lagarto, Ana Nave, João Jesus, Virgílio Castelo|publisher=Thrust Media Productions|access-date=2021-03-29}}</ref>
