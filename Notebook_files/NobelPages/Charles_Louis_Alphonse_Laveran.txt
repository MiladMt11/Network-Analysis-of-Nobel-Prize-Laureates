'''Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran''' (18 June 1845 – 18 May 1922) was a French physician who won the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1907 for his discoveries of [[parasitic]] [[protozoans]] as causative agents of [[infectious diseases]] such as [[malaria]] and [[trypanosomiasis]]. Following his father, Louis Théodore Laveran, he took up military medicine as his profession. He obtained his medical degree from [[University of Strasbourg]] in 1867.

At the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870, he joined the [[French Army]]. At the age of 29 he became Chair of Military Diseases and Epidemics at the [[Val-de-Grâce|École de Val-de-Grâce]]. At the end of his tenure in 1878 he worked in [[Algeria]], where he made his major achievements. He discovered that the protozoan parasite ''[[Plasmodium]]'' was responsible for malaria, and that ''[[Trypanosoma]]'' caused trypanosomiasis or African sleeping sickness.<ref>{{Cite journal | pmid=11956550 | last=Nye | first=Edwin R | year=2002 | title=Alphonse Laveran (1845–1922): discoverer of the malarial parasite and Nobel laureate, 1907 | volume=10 | issue=2 | periodical=Journal of Medical Biography | pages=81–7| doi=10.1177/096777200201000205| s2cid=39278614}}</ref> In 1894 he returned to France to serve in various military health services. In 1896 he joined [[Pasteur Institute]] as Chief of the Honorary Service, from where he received the Nobel Prize. He donated half of his Nobel prize money to establish the Laboratory of Tropical Medicine at the Pasteur Institute. In 1908, he founded the Société de Pathologie Exotique.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Garnham|first=PC|title=Presidential address: reflections on Laveran, Marchiafava, Golgi, Koch and Danilewsky after sixty years|journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=1967|volume=61|issue=6|pages=753–64|doi=10.1016/0035-9203(67)90030-2|pmid=4865951|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Laveran was elected to [[French Academy of Sciences]] in 1893, and was conferred Commander of the [[National Order of the Legion of Honour]] in 1912.

==Early life and education==
Alphonse Laveran was born at [[Boulevard Saint-Michel]] in Paris, to parents Louis Théodore Laveran and Marie-Louise Anselme Guénard de la Tour Laveran.<ref name=oakes>{{cite book|last1=Oakes|first1=Elizabeth H.|title=Encyclopedia of World Scientists|date=2007|publisher=Facts on File|location=New York (US)|isbn=978-1-43-811882-6|pages=427–428|edition=Revised|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uPRB-OED1bcC&pg=PA427 }}</ref> He was an only son with one sister. His family was in a military environment. His father was an army doctor and a Professor of military medicine at the École de Val-de-Grâce. His mother was the daughter of an army commander. At a young age his family went to Algeria to accompany his father's service. He was educated in Paris, and completed his higher education from [[Collège Saint Barbe]] and later from the [[Lycée Louis-le-Grand]]. Following his father he chose military medicine and entered the Public Health School at [[Strasbourg]] in 1863. In 1866 he became a resident medical student in the Strasbourg civil hospitals. In 1867 he submitted a thesis on the regeneration of nerves and earned his medical degree from the University of Strasbourg.<ref name=nobel>{{cite web|title=Alphonse Laveran – Biographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1907/laveran-bio.html|work=Nobelprize.org|publisher=Nobel Media AB|access-date=13 March 2014|year=2013}}</ref>

==Career==
Laveran was Medical Assistant-Major of the French Army at the time of Franco-Prussian War. He was posted to [[Metz]], where the French were eventually defeated and the place occupied by Germans. He was sent to work at [[Lille]] hospital and then to the St Martin Hospital (now [[St Martin's House]]) in Paris. In 1874 he qualified a competitive examination by which he was appointed to the Chair of Military Diseases and Epidemics at the École de Val-de-Grâce, a position his father had occupied. His tenure ended in 1878 and he was sent to Algeria, where he remained until 1883. From 1884 to 1889 he was Professor of Military Hygiene at the École de Val-de-Grâce. In 1894 he was appointed Chief Medical Officer of the military hospital at Lille and then Director of Health Services of the 11th Army Corps at [[Nantes]]. By then he was promoted to the rank of Principal Medical Officer of the First Class. In 1896 he entered the Pasteur Institute as Chief of the Honorary Service to pursue a full-time research on tropical diseases.<ref name=nobel/>

In 1880, while working in the [[military hospital]] in [[Constantine, Algeria]], he discovered that the cause of [[malaria]] is a [[protozoa]]n, after observing the parasites in a [[blood smear]] taken from a patient who had just died of malaria.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Bruce-Chwatt LJ |title=Alphonse Laveran's discovery 100 years ago and today's global fight against malaria |journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine |volume=74 |issue=7 |pages=531–536 |year=1981 |pmid=7021827 |pmc=1439072|doi=10.1177/014107688107400715 }}</ref>  He found the causative organism to be a protozoan which he named ''Oscillaria malariae'', but later renamed ''[[Plasmodium]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Cox|first=Francis EG|title=History of the discovery of the malaria parasites and their vectors|journal=Parasites & Vectors|year=2010|volume=3|issue=1|pages=5|doi=10.1186/1756-3305-3-5|pmid=20205846| pmc=2825508 }}</ref><ref name=haas>{{cite journal|last=Haas|first=L F|title=Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran (1845-1922)|journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery & Psychiatry|year=1999|volume=67|issue=4|pages=520|doi=10.1136/jnnp.67.4.520|pmid=10486402| pmc=1736558 }}</ref> This was the first time that protozoans were shown to be a cause of disease of any kind. The discovery was therefore a validation of the germ theory of diseases.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sherman|first=Irwin|title=Reflections on a Century of Malaria Biochemistry|journal=Advances in Parasitology|year=2008|volume=67|publisher=Academic Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-0809-2183-9|pages=3–4|doi=10.1016/S0065-308X(08)00401-6|pmid=18940418|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t9e81NrD0FIC&pg=PA3 }}</ref>

Laveran later worked on the [[trypanosomes]], particularly [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], and showed once again that protozoans were responsible for the disease.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sundberg|first=C|title=Alphonse Laveran: the Nobel Prize for Medicine 1907|journal=Parassitologia|year=2007|volume=49|issue=4|pages=257–60|pmid=18689237}}</ref>

==Awards and honours==
Laveran was awarded the Bréant Prize (''Prix Bréant'') of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] in 1889 and the [[Edward Jenner Medal]] of the [[Royal Society of Medicine]] in 1902 for his discovery of the malarial parasite. He received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1907. He gave half the Prize for foundation of the Laboratory of Tropical Medicine at the Pasteur Institute. In 1908 he founded the [[Société de pathologie exotique]], over which he presided for 12 years. He was elected to membership in the French Academy of Sciences in 1893, and was conferred Commander of the [[National Order of the Legion of Honour]] in 1912. He was Honorary Director of the Pasteur Institute in 1915 on his 70th birthday. He was elected President of the [[French Academy of Medicine]] in 1920.  His work was commemorated philatelically on a stamp issued by Algeria in 1954.<ref name=haas/>
