'''Paul Greengard''' (December 11, 1925 – April 13, 2019) was an [[United States|American]] [[neuroscientist]] best known for his work on the [[molecule|molecular]] and [[cell (biology)|cellular]] function of [[neuron]]s. In 2000, Greengard, [[Arvid Carlsson]] and [[Eric Kandel]] were awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] for their discoveries concerning [[signal transduction]] in the [[nervous system]]. He was [[Vincent Astor]] Professor at [[Rockefeller University]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockefeller.edu/research/abstract.php?id=53|title=Paul Greengard profile|publisher=[[Rockefeller University]]|access-date=2008-09-28|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922135126/http://www.rockefeller.edu/research/abstract.php?id=53|archive-date=2008-09-22}}</ref> and served on the Scientific Advisory Board of the [[Cure Alzheimer's Fund]], as well as the Scientific Council of the [[Brain & Behavior Research Foundation]]. He was married to artist [[Ursula von Rydingsvard]].

==Biography==
Greengard was born in [[New York City]], the son of Pearl (née Meister) and Benjamin Greengard, a vaudeville comedian. His older sister was actress [[Irene Kane]], who later became a writer by the name of [[Chris Chase]]; she died in 2013, aged 89. Their mother died in childbirth<ref name=nyas/> and their father remarried in 1927.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/26/science/26conv.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Claudia | last=Dreifus | title=He Turned His Nobel Into a Prize for Women | date=September 26, 2006}}</ref> The Greengard siblings' parents were Jewish, but their stepmother was [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]]. He and his sister were "brought up in the Christian tradition".<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2000/greengard-autobio.html Profile of Paul Greengard], nobelprize.org; accessed December 28, 2013.</ref>

During [[World War II]], he served in the [[United States Navy]] as an [[electronics]] technician at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] working on an early warning system against Japanese [[kamikaze]] planes. After World War II, he attended [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] where he graduated in 1948 with a bachelor's degree in [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]. He decided against graduate school in physics because most post-war physics research was focusing on [[nuclear weapon]]s, and instead became interested in [[biophysics]].

Greengard began his graduate studies at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in the lab of [[Haldan Keffer Hartline]]. Inspired by a lecture by [[Alan Hodgkin]], Greengard began work on the molecular and cellular function of neurons. He received his PhD in 1953 and began postdoctoral work at the [[University of London]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], and the [[University of Amsterdam]].<ref name=mjf>{{cite web|url=https://www.michaeljfox.org/foundation/researchers.php?id=891|title=Paul Greengard, PhD|publisher=The Michael J.

After leaving Geigy in 1967, he worked briefly at the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] and [[Vanderbilt University]] before taking a position as Professor in the Department of Pharmacology at [[Yale University]]. In 1983 he joined the faculty of [[The Rockefeller University]].<ref name=mjf/> Greengard was a member of the Board of Scientific Governors at [[The Scripps Research Institute]]. He was the acting chairman of the [[Fisher Center for Alzheimer's Research Foundation]] and served on the board of the Michael Stern Parkinson's Research Foundation, which later merged with [[The Michael J. Fox Foundation]].<ref name=mspr>{{cite web|url=https://www.michaeljfox.org/foundation/publication-detail.html?id=586&category=7|title=The Michael J.

==Research==
Greengard's research focused on events inside the neuron caused by [[neurotransmitter]]s. Specifically, Greengard and his fellow researchers studied the behavior of [[second messenger]] cascades that transform the docking of a neurotransmitter with a receptor into permanent changes in the neuron. In a series of experiments, Greengard and his colleagues showed that when [[dopamine]] interacts with a [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] on the [[cell membrane]] of a neuron, it causes an increase in [[cyclic AMP]] inside the cell. This increase of cyclic AMP, in turn activates a protein called [[protein kinase A]], which turns other proteins on or off by adding [[phosphate]] groups in a reaction known as [[phosphorylation]]. The proteins activated by phosphorylation can then perform a number of changes in the cell: transcribing [[DNA]] to make new proteins, moving more receptors to the [[synapse]] (and thus increasing the neuron's sensitivity), or moving [[ion channel]]s to the cell surface (and thus increasing the cell's excitability). He shared the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with [[Arvid Carlsson]] and [[Eric Kandel]] for his work on the central regulatory protein [[DARPP-32]].<ref name="nobel2000">{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2000/press-release/|title=Press Release: The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2000|publisher=NobelPrize.org|date=9 October 2000|access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref>

==Family==

In 1985, Paul Greengard married internationally renowned sculptor [[Ursula von Rydingsvard]], who has received numerous awards and grants, including two awards from the [[National Endowment of the Arts]], a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]], the Skowhegan Medal for Sculpture, and three awards from the American section of the International Association of Art Critics. von Rydingsvard is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]], and her artworks are among the permanent collections of the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], The Brooklyn Museum, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, the [[National Gallery of Art]] and the Walker Art Center.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Harrison |title=Paul Greengard, Nobel laureate who showed how nerve cells communicate, dies at 93 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/paul-greengard-nobel-laureate-who-showed-how-nerve-cells-communicate-dies-at-93/2019/04/15/b6b403d2-5f88-11e9-bfad-36a7eb36cb60_story.html |access-date=10 January 2021 |work=Washington Post}}</ref>

In February 2018, a federal jury in the Southern District of New York found The Rockefeller University liable for discrimination based on race and national origin which occurred in 2007 in the lab of, and under the supervision of, Greengard.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blhny.com/single-post/2018/02/28/225-Million-Jury-Verdict-in-Race-Discrimination-Case-Against-Rockefeller-University|title=$2.25 Million Jury Verdict in Race/National Origin Discrimination Case Against Rockefeller University|date=28 February 2018|access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2007/06/03/bias-suit-slaps-city-nobel-prof/|title=Bias Suit Slaps City Nobel Prof|author=Fisher J|date=3 June 2007|publisher=The New York Post|access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref>

==Pearl Meister Greengard Prize==
Paul Greengard used his Nobel Prize honorarium to help fund the [[Pearl Meister Greengard Prize]], an [[List of prizes, medals, and awards for women in science|award for women scientists]]. The award is named after his mother, who died during childbirth.<ref name=nyas/> It was established in 2004 to shine a spotlight on exceptional [[women in science]], since, as Greengard observed, "[women] are not yet receiving awards and honors at a level commensurate with their achievements."<ref>{{cite web|author=Betsy Hanson|title=The Birth of an Award|work=Benchmarks|date=December 17, 2004|url=http://www.rockefeller.edu/benchmarks/benchmarks_121704_c.php|access-date=2008-09-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207150824/http://www.rockefeller.edu/benchmarks/benchmarks_121704_c.php|archive-date=February 7, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The annual prize is awarded to an outstanding woman conducting biomedical research.<ref name="NYTimes">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/26/science/26conv.html|title=He Turned His Nobel Into a Prize for Women|access-date=September 26, 2006 |last=Dreifus |author-link=Claudia Dreifus |first=Claudia|work=New York Times|date=September 26, 2006}}</ref>
