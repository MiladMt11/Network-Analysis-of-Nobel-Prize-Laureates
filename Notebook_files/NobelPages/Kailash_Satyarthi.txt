'''Kailash Satyarthi''' (born 11 January 1954) is an Indian social reformer who campaigned against [[child labour in India]] and advocated the universal right to [[education]]. In 2014, he was the co-recipient of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]], along with [[Malala Yousafzai]], "for their struggle against the suppression of children and ''young'' people and for the right of all children to education." He is the founder of multiple social activist organizations, including [[Bachpan Bachao Andolan]], [[Global March Against Child Labour]], [[Global Campaign for Education]] and Kailash Satyarthi Children's Foundation.

Kailash Satyarthi and his team at Bachpan Bachao Andolan have liberated more than 86,000<ref>https://bba.org.in/</ref> children in India from [[child labour]], slavery and [[child trafficking in India|trafficking]]. In 1998, Satyarthi conceived and led the Global March against Child Labour,<ref name="auto">{{Cite web |url= http://www.globalmarch.org/aboutus/howwestarted|title=How we started {{!}} Global March Against Child Labour |website= www.globalmarch.org |access-date=6 November 2017}}</ref> an 80,000&nbsp;km (ca. 49,710&nbsp;mi)-long march across 103 countries to put forth a global demand against worst forms of child labour. This became one of the largest social movements ever on behalf of exploited children. The demands of the marchers, which included children and youth (particularly the survivors of trafficking for forced labour, exploitation, sexual abuse, illegal organ transplants, armed conflict, etc.) were reflected in the draft of the [[Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention|ILO Convention 182]] on the Worst Forms of Child Labour. The following year, the Convention was unanimously adopted at the ILO Conference in Geneva.

He has served on the board and committee of several international organisations including the [[Center for Victims of Torture]] (USA), the [[International Labor Rights Forum|International Labor Rights Fund]] (USA), and the Cocoa Initiative. Satyarthi was among [[Fortune (magazine)|''Fortune'']] magazine's "World's Greatest Leaders" in 2015<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://www.livemint.com/Politics/PSgnyCQBtja2Llvacf5CIM/Modi-Kailash-Satyarthi-among-Fortunes-list-of-worlds-grea.html|title=Modi, Kailash Satyarthi among Fortune's list of world's greatest leaders |last=Singh |first=Yoshita |date=27 March 2015 |work= livemint.com |access-date= 6 November 2017}}</ref> and featured in [[LinkedIn]]'s Power Profiles List in 2017 and 2018.<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://www.news18.com/news/tech/modi-priyanka-linkedin-power-profiles-1499681.html |title= Modi, Priyanka Feature in LinkedIn Power Profiles List of 2017 |work=News18 |access-date= 6 November 2017}}</ref> Satyarthi led a nationwide march, Bharat Yatra,<ref>{{Cite news |url= http://www.thestatesman.com/india/kailash-satyarthis-bharat-yatra-culminates-rashtrapati-bhavan-1502512184.html |title=19,000 km in 35 days: Kailash Satyarthi's Bharat Yatra culminates at Rashtrapati Bhavan|date=16 October 2017|work=The Statesman |access-date=6 November 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> in India covering {{cvt|19,000|km}} in 35 days, to demand for legislation against child rape, [[child sexual abuse]] and trafficking.

==Early life==
Satyarthi was born in [[Vidisha]], a small town in the Indian state of [[Madhya Pradesh]] into a middy. He is the youngest among four brothers and a sister in his family. His father was a retired police head constable and his mother was an uneducated housewife with high morals. As per Satyarthi, this exceptionally idealistic and helpful nature of his mother had a big impact on him. He was raised in a locality (''mohalla'') where Hindus and Muslims lived with each other. As a four-year-old toddler, he learned to read Urdu from the Maulvi at the neighboring mosque and learned Hindi and English in his school.<ref name="Regunathan">{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/friday-review/kailash-satyarthi-how-he-got-his-name/article7158927.ece|title=How he got his name|last=Regunathan|first=Sudhamahi|date=30 April 2015|work=The Hindu|access-date=6 November 2017|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref>
