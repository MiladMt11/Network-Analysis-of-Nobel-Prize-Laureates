== Personal life ==
Feringa was born as the son of farmer Geert Feringa (1918–1993) and his wife Lies Feringa née Hake (1924–2013). Feringa was the second of ten siblings in a Catholic family. He spent his youth on the family's farm, which is directly on the border with Germany, in [[Barger-Compascuum]] in the [[Bourtange moor]]. He is of Dutch and German descent. Among his ancestors is the settler [[:de:Johann Gerhard Bekel|Johann Gerhard Bekel]]. Together with his wife Betty Feringa, he has three daughters. He lives in [[Paterswolde]] near [[Groningen]].<ref>See German and Dutch Wikipedia.</ref>

Aside from molecular motors and switches, Feringa's work has crossed many disciplines and includes the use of chiral electromagnetic radiation to generate enantioselectivity, low molecular weight gelators, imaging porphyrins with STM, drying induced self-assembly, organic synthesis, CD spectroscopy, asymmetric catalysis, exploring the origins of chirality including the possibility of an extraterrestrial source and various aspects of surface science including surface modification, surface energy control, and porphyrin allayers.
