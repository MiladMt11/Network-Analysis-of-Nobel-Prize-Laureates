'''Francis William Aston''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]]<ref name="frs"/> (1 September 1877 – 20 November 1945) was a British [[chemist]] and [[physicist]] who won the 1922 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his discovery, by means of his [[mass spectrograph]], of isotopes in many non-radioactive elements and for his enunciation of the [[whole number rule]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1922/  | title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1922  | access-date=14 April 2008  | publisher=Nobel Foundation }}</ref><ref name='a804629h'>{{cite journal | title=Francis Aston and the mass spectrograph | journal=[[Dalton Transactions]]  | year=1998 | first=Gordon | last=Squires | issue= 23| pages=3893–3900 | doi= 10.1039/a804629h }}</ref> He was a fellow of the [[Royal Society]]<ref name="frs"/> and Fellow of [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].<ref name=obit/>

==Early life==
[[Image:Mason Science College.png|thumb|left|[[Mason Science College|Mason College]], before its incorporation into the University of Birmingham; this building was destroyed in 1964.]]
Francis Aston was born in [[Harborne]], now part of Birmingham, on 1 September 1877.<ref>{{openplaque|1616}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=The Encyclopedia of Mass Spectrometry | author=Kevin M. Downard | volume=9B | pages=6–8 | year=2015 | doi=10.1016/B978-0-08-100379-4.00048-4 | chapter=Francis William Aston | isbn=9780081003794 }}</ref> He was the third child and second son of William Aston and Fanny Charlotte Hollis. He was educated at the Harborne Vicarage School and later [[Malvern College]] in Worcestershire where he was a boarder. In 1893 Francis William Aston began his university studies at [[Mason College]] (which was then external college of University of London) where he was taught physics by [[John Henry Poynting]] and chemistry by [[Percy F. Frankland|Frankland]] and [[William A. Tilden|Tilden]]. From 1896 on he conducted additional research on [[organic chemistry]] in a private laboratory at his father's house. In 1898 he started as a student of Frankland financed by a Forster Scholarship; his work concerned optical properties of [[tartaric acid]] compounds. He started to work on [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation chemistry]] at the school of brewing in Birmingham and was employed by W. Butler & Co. Brewery in 1900. This period of employment ended in 1903 when he returned to the University of Birmingham under Poynting as an Associate.

==Research==
With a scholarship from the [[University of Birmingham]], he pursued research in physics following the discovery of [[X-rays]] and [[radioactivity]] in the mid-1890s.  Aston studied the current through a [[gas-filled tube]]. The research, conducted with self-made discharge tubes, led him to investigate the volume of the [[Aston dark space]].<ref>{{cite journal | title=Experiments on a New Cathode Dark Space in Helium and Hydrogen | author=Francis William Aston | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A | volume=80 | issue=535 | pages=45–49 | year=1907 | doi=10.1098/rspa.1907.0072 | jstor=92589|bibcode = 1907RSPSA..80...45A | doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title=Experiments on the Length of the Cathode Dark Space with Varying Current Densities and Pressures in Different Gases | author= Francis William Aston | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A | volume=79 | issue=528 | pages=80–95 | year=1907 | doi=10.1098/rspa.1907.0016 | jstor=92573|bibcode = 1907RSPSA..79...80A | doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | title=The Distribution of Electric Force in the Crookes Dark Space | author=Francis William Aston | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A | volume=84 | issue=573 | pages=526–535 | year=1911 | doi=10.1098/rspa.1911.0005 | jstor=93257|bibcode = 1911RSPSA..84..526A | doi-access=free }}</ref>

After the death of his father, and a trip around the world in 1908, he was appointed lecturer at the University of Birmingham in 1909 but moved to the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] in [[Cambridge]] on the invitation of [[J. J. Thomson]] in 1910.

Birmingham University awarded him a BSc in Applied/Pure Science in 1910{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} and a DSc in Applied/Pure Science in 1914.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://bhamalumni.org/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?pid=610#FrancisAston |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 September 2014 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/65laWDU4W?url=http://bhamalumni.org/NetCommunity/Page.aspx?pid=610#FrancisAston |archive-date=27 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Joseph John Thomson revealed the nature of the [[cathode ray]] and then discovered the electron and he was now doing research on the positively charged "[[Anode ray|Kanalstrahlen]]" discovered by [[Eugen Goldstein]] in 1886. The method of deflecting particles in the "Kanalstrahlen" by magnetic fields was discovered by [[Wilhelm Wien]] in 1908; combining magnetic and electric fields allowed the separation of different ions by their ratio of charge and mass.  Ions of a particular charge/mass ratio would leave a characteristic parabolic trace on a photographic plate, demonstrating for the first time that atoms of a single element could have different masses. The first sector field [[mass spectrometer]] was the result of these experiments.<ref name="Jones">{{cite web |author-first=Mark |author-last=Jones|title=Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry  |url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/gas-chromatography-mass-spectrometry.html |website=American Chemical Society |access-date=19 Nov 2019}}</ref>

It was speculations about isotopy that directly gave rise to the building of a mass spectrometer capable of separating the isotopes of the chemical elements. Aston initially worked on the identification of [[isotope]]s in the element [[neon]] and later chlorine and mercury. [[First World War]] stalled and delayed his research on providing experimental proof for the existence of isotopes by mass spectroscopy and during the war, Aston worked at the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] in Farnborough as a Technical Assistant working on aeronautical coatings.

After the war, he returned to research at the [[Cavendish Laboratory]] in Cambridge and completed building his first [[mass spectrometry|mass spectrograph]] that he reported on in 1919.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=D.Sc|first=F. W. Aston M. A.|date=1919-12-01|title=LXXIV. A positive ray spectrograph|journal=The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science|volume=38|issue=228|pages=707–714|doi=10.1080/14786441208636004|issn=1941-5982|url=https://zenodo.org/record/1430906}}</ref> Subsequent improvements in the instrument led to the development of a second and third instrument of improved mass resolving power and mass accuracy. These instruments employing electromagnetic focusing allowed him to identify 212 naturally occurring isotopes. In 1921, Aston became a member of the [[Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights|International Committee on Atomic Weights]]<ref>{{cite journal|author=F.W. Aston|title=Report of the International Committee on Chemical Elements: 1923|doi=10.1021/ja01657a001|journal=[[Journal of the American Chemical Society|J. Am. Chem. Soc.]] | year = 1923 | volume = 45 | pages = 867–874 | issue = 4|display-authors=etal}}</ref> and a fellow of the [[Royal Society]]<ref name="frs"/> and received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] the following year.

His work on isotopes also led to his formulation of the [[whole number rule]] which states that "the mass of the oxygen isotope being defined [as 16], all the other isotopes have masses that are very nearly whole numbers," a rule that was used extensively in the development of [[Nuclear physics|nuclear energy]]. The exact mass of many isotopes was measured leading to the result that hydrogen has a 1% higher mass than expected by the average mass of the other elements. Aston speculated about the subatomic energy and the use of it in 1936.

''Isotopes''<ref>{{cite book | last = Aston | first = Francis William | title = Isotopes | publisher = E.

In his private life, he was a sportsman, [[cross-country skiing]] and [[ice skating|skating]] in winter time, during his regular visits to [[Switzerland]] and [[Norway]]; deprived of these winter sports during the [[First World War]] he started climbing. Between the ages of 20 and 25 he spent a large part of his spare time cycling. With the invention of [[motorised vehicle]]s he constructed a [[Internal combustion engine|combustion engine]] of his own in 1902 and participated in the [[Gordon Bennett Cup in auto racing|Gordon Bennett auto race]] in Ireland in 1903. Not content with these sports he also engaged in swimming, golf, especially with [[Ernest Rutherford|Rutherford]] and other colleagues in Cambridge,<ref>{{cite journal  | title=Cavendish's Crocodile and Dark Horse – The Lives of Rutherford and Aston in Parallel | author=KM Downard  | journal=Mass Spectrometry Reviews | volume=26 | issue=5 | pages=713–723 | year=2007 | doi=10.1002/mas.20145  | pmid=17546675| bibcode=2007MSRv...26..713D| doi-access=free }}</ref> tennis, winning some prizes at open tournaments in England [[Wales]] and Ireland and learning surfing in [[Honolulu]] in 1909. Coming from a musical family, he was capable of playing the piano, violin and cello at a level such that he regularly played in concerts at Cambridge. He visited many places around the globe on extensive travel tours starting from 1908 with a trip to Australia and [[New Zealand]] which he visited again in 1938–1939.<ref name="frs">{{Cite journal | last1 = Hevesy | first1 = G. | author-link = George de Hevesy| title = Francis William Aston. 1877–1945 | doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1948.0002 | journal = [[Obituary Notices of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 5 | issue = 16 | pages = 634–650| year = 1948 | jstor = 768761| s2cid = 191531223 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal  | title=Francis William Aston – the man behind the mass spectrograph | author=KM Downard  | journal=European Journal of Mass Spectrometry | volume=13 | issue=3 | pages=177–190 | year=2007 | doi=10.1255/ejms.878  | pmid=17881785| s2cid=25747367 }}</ref>

Aston was a skilled photographer and interested in [[astronomy]]. He joined several expeditions to study solar eclipses in Benkoeben in 1925, [[Sumatra]] in 1932, Magog in Canada on 31 August 1932 and Kamishari [[Hokkaido, Japan]] on June19th 1936. He also planned to attend expeditions to South Africa in 1940 and [[Brazil]] in 1945 in later life. He never married.

==Death==
Aston died in Cambridge on 20 November 1945. He was 68 years old.<ref name=obit>{{cite news |title=Dr. F.W. Aston Dies. Winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1922.
