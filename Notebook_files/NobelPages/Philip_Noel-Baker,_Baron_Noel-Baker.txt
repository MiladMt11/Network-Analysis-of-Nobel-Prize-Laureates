==Early life and athletic career==
Baker was born in [[Brondesbury Park]], London,<ref name="ODNB"/> the sixth of seven children of the Canadian-born [[Quaker]], [[Joseph Allen Baker]] and the Scottish-born Elizabeth Balmer Moscrip. His father had moved to England in 1876 to establish a manufacturing business and served as a [[Progressive Party (London)|Progressive]] member of the [[London County Council]] from 1895 to 1906 and as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] member of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] for [[East Finsbury (UK Parliament constituency)|East Finsbury]] from 1905 to 1918.

Baker was educated at [[Ackworth School]], [[Bootham School]], and then in the US at the Quaker-associated [[Haverford College]] in Pennsylvania. He studied at [[King's College, Cambridge]], from 1908 to 1912. As well as being an excellent student, obtaining a second in Part I history and a first in Part II economics, he was President of the [[Cambridge Union Society]] in 1912 and President of the [[Cambridge University Athletic Club]] from 1910 to 1912.<ref name="ODNB"/>

He was a competitor in the Olympic Games as a middle-distance runner, both before and after the First World War, representing [[Team GB|Great Britain]] in the [[800 metres]] and [[Athletics at the 1912 Summer Olympics – Men's 1500 metres|1500 metres]] at the [[1912 Olympic Games]] in Stockholm.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.olympedia.org/athletes/69349 |title=Philip Noel-Baker |work=Olympedia |access-date=18 April 2021}}</ref> He reached the final of the 1500 metres, won by his fellow countryman [[Arnold Jackson (British Army officer)|Arnold Jackson]]. At the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in Antwerp Baker was captain of the British track team and carried the team's flag. He won his first race in the 800 metres, but then concentrated on the 1500 metres, taking the silver medal behind his teammate [[Albert Hill (athlete)|Albert Hill]].<ref name=sr>[https://web.archive.org/web/20200417114459/https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/ba/philip-baker-1.html Philip Baker]. sports-reference.com</ref> He was captain again at the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] in Paris, but did not compete.<ref name="ODNB"/>

Baker's early career was as an academic. In 1914 he was appointed as vice-principal of [[Ruskin College, Oxford]], and in 1915 was elected a fellow at King's College, Cambridge.<ref name="ODNB"/> During [[World War I]], he organised and led the [[Friends' Ambulance Unit]] attached to the fighting front in France (1914–1915), and was then, as a [[conscientious objector]] from 1916, adjutant of the First British Ambulance Unit for Italy, in association with the [[British Red Cross]] (1915–1918), for which he received military medals from the UK, France and Italy.<ref name=sr/>

==Political career==
After World War I, Noel-Baker was closely involved in the formation of the [[League of Nations]], serving as assistant to [[Robert Cecil, 1st Viscount Cecil of Chelwood|Lord Robert Cecil]], then assistant to Sir [[James Eric Drummond|Eric Drummond]], the league's first secretary-general.

He was elected as the member for [[Coventry (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry]] in 1929, and served as [[parliamentary private secretary]] to the [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Arthur Henderson]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Noel-Baker|first=Philip|title=The Geneva Protocol for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes|location=London|publisher=P.S. King & Son Ltd|year=1925}}</ref>

Noel-Baker lost his seat in 1931, but remained Henderson's assistant while Henderson was president of the [[World Disarmament Conference]] in Geneva in 1932 to 1933. He stood for Parliament again in Coventry in 1935, unsuccessfully, but won the [[1936 Derby by-election|Derby by-election]] in July 1936 after the sitting [[Derby (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby]] Member of Parliament [[James Henry Thomas|J. H. Thomas]] resigned. When that constituency was split in 1950, he transferred to [[Derby South (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby South]].

Noel-Baker became a member of the Labour Party's [[National Executive Committee of the Labour Party|National Executive Committee]] in 1937. On 21 June 1938, Noel-Baker, as M.P. for [[Derby (UK Parliament constituency)|Derby]], in the run up to [[World War II]], spoke at the House of Commons against aerial bombing of German cities based on moral grounds.

Noel-Baker was the minister responsible for organising the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 Olympic Games]] in London. He moved to the [[Ministry of Fuel and Power]] in 1950. In the mid-1940s, Noel-Baker served on the British delegation to what became the [[United Nations]], helping to draft its charter and other rules for operation as a British delegate. He served as [[Chairman of the Labour Party]] in 1946–47, but lost his place on the National Executive Committee in 1948, his place being taken by [[Michael Foot]].<ref name= "GE">{{cite news |title=NOEL-BAKER DROPPED |work=Gloucester Echo |date=18 May 1948 |access-date=2 November 2015 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000320/19480518/004/0001| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|url-access=subscription }}</ref> An opponent of left-wing [[Bevanite]] policies in the 1950s, and an advocate of multilateral nuclear disarmament, rather than a policy of [[unilateral disarmament]], he received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1959. In 1979, with [[Fenner Brockway]], he co-founded the World Disarmament Campaign, serving as co-Chair until he died,<ref>{{Nobelprize}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Whittaker|first=David J.|title=Fighter for peace: Philip Noel-Baker 1889–1982|publisher=Sessions|location=York|year=1989|isbn=1-85072-056-8}}</ref> and was an active supporter of disarmament into the 1980s.

Noel-Baker stood down as the MP for Derby South at the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]], at which he was succeeded by [[Walter Johnson (politician)|Walter Johnson]]. His [[life peer]]age was announced in the [[1977 Silver Jubilee and Birthday Honours]]<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=47234 |date=10 June 1977 |page=7080 |supp=y}}</ref> and he was raised to the [[Peerage of the United Kingdom|peerage]] 22 July 1977, as '''Baron Noel-Baker''', of the [[City of Derby]],<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=47285 |date=26 July 1977 |page=9679}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette |issue=20121 |date=26 July 1977 |page=861 |city=e}}</ref> having declined an appointment as a [[Companion of Honour]] in the 1965 New Year Honours.

==Personal life==
In June 1915, Philip Baker married Irene Noel, a field hospital nurse in [[East Grinstead]], subsequently adopting the hyphenated name '''Noel-Baker''' in 1921 by deed poll.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=32613 |date=17 February 1922 |page=1455 |supp=y}}</ref> His wife was a friend of [[Virginia Woolf]]. Their only son, [[Francis Noel-Baker]], also became a Labour MP and served together with his father in the Commons. Their marriage, however was not a success and Noel-Baker's mistress from 1936 was [[Megan Lloyd George]], daughter of the former [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] leader [[David Lloyd George]], herself a Liberal and later Labour MP. The relationship ended when Irene died in 1956.

Following Noel-Baker's death in [[Westminster]], aged 92, he was buried alongside his wife in [[Heyshott]], West Sussex.<ref name="ODNB">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31505 David Howell, "Baker, Philip John Noel-, Baron Noel-Baker (1889–1982)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2012]; accessed 7 December 2014.</ref>
