'''Jerome Karle''' (born '''Jerome Karfunkle'''; June 18, 1918 – June 6, 2013) was an American [[physical chemist]]. Jointly with [[Herbert A. Hauptman]], he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Chemistry]] in 1985, for the direct analysis of [[crystal structure]]s using [[X-ray scattering techniques]].<ref name=Nobel/><ref name=NRL>[http://www.nrl.navy.mil/content.php?P=NOBEL NRL Scientists Receive 1985 Nobel Prize in Chemistry] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008174813/http://www.nrl.navy.mil/content.php?P=NOBEL |date=2007-10-08 }}, [[United States Naval Research Laboratory]].

He started college at the age of 15 and received his [[bachelor's degree]] from the [[City College of New York]] in 1937, where he took additional courses in biology, chemistry and math in addition to the required curriculum there. He earned a [[master's degree]] from [[Harvard University]] in 1938, having majored in biology.<ref name=Nobel/><ref name="Bohning">{{cite book|editor-first1=James J.|editor-last1= Bohning|editor-first2=David K. |editor-last2=Van Keuren|title=Isabella Karle and Jerome Karle, Transcript of an Interview Conducted by James J.

As part of a plan to accumulate enough money to pay for further graduate studies, Karle took a position in [[Albany, New York]] with the [[New York State Department of Health]], where he developed a method to measure dissolved [[fluoride]] levels, a technique that would become a standard for [[water fluoridation]].<ref name=Nobel/>

He enrolled at the [[University of Michigan]] in 1940 and met his future wife, [[Isabella_Karle|Isabella Lugoski]], who was sitting at an adjoining desk during his first course in physical chemistry. The two married in 1942. They were both supervised in their Ph.D. studies by physical chemist [[Lawrence Brockway]]. Though Karle completed his studies in 1943, he was awarded his [[Ph.D.]] the following year.<ref name=Nobel/><ref name="Bohning"/>

Jerome Karle was a former president of both the [[American Crystallographic Association]] (ACA) (1972) and the [[IUCr]] (1981-1984), as well as a co-recipient of the 1985 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on [[Direct methods (crystallography)|direct methods]]. Among the many additional honors he received for his work, he was elected to the [[National Academy of Sciences]] in 1976,<ref name="Bohning"/> the Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]] in 1986,<ref>{{cite web|title= Golden Plate Awardees of the American Academy of Achievement |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://achievement.org/our-history/golden-plate-awards/#science-exploration}}</ref> and the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 1990.

==Research and Nobel Prize==
Starting in 1943, after completing graduate studies, Karle worked on the [[Manhattan Project]] at the [[University of Chicago]] with his wife Dr. [[Isabella Karle]], one of the youngest scientists and few women on the project. In 1944, they returned to the [[University of Michigan]], where Karle worked on a project for the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory]]. In 1946, they moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] to work for the Naval Research Laboratory.<ref name=Nobel/>

Karle and Herbert A. Hauptman were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1985 for their work in using X-ray scattering techniques to determine the structure of crystals, a technique that is used to study the biological, chemical, metallurgical and physical characteristics. They were able to employ the [[Sayre equation]] in centrosymmetric structure, developing the so-called [[direct methods (crystallography)|direct methods]]. Through isolating the position of the atoms in a crystal, the molecular structure of the material being studied can be determined, allowing processes to be designed to duplicate the molecules being studied. This technique has played a major role in the development of new pharmaceutical products and other synthesized materials.<ref name=NRL/>

[[Image:Karle Retirement.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Jerome (left foreground) and [[Isabella Karle]] (seated center) at their 2009 retirement ceremony]]
Karle and his wife retired from the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory on July 31, 2009, after a combined 127 years of service to the United States Government, with Karle joining the NRL in 1944 and his wife two years later. At the time of his departure from government service, Karle held the Chair of Science as Chief Scientist of the Laboratory for the Structure of Matter. Retirement ceremonies for the Karles were attended by [[United States Secretary of the Navy]] [[Ray Mabus]], who presented the couple with the Department of the Navy Distinguished Civilian Service Award, the Navy's highest form of recognition to civilian employees.<ref>McKinney, Donna.
