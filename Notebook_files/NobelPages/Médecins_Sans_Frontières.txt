'''{{lang|fr|Médecins Sans Frontières}}''' ('''MSF'''; pronounced {{IPA-fr|medsɛ̃ sɑ̃ fʁɔ̃tjɛʁ||Fr-Médecins Sans Frontières.oga}}), sometimes rendered in English as '''Doctors Without Borders''', is an international [[Humanitarian aid|humanitarian]] medical [[International non-governmental organization|non-governmental organisation]] (NGO) of French origin best known for its projects in conflict zones and in [[developing country|countries]] affected by [[Endemic (epidemiology)|endemic diseases]]. In 2019, the group was active in 70 countries with over 35,000 personnel mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators.<ref>{{cite web |title=Our staff |url=http://www.msf.org/our-staff |access-date=2 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150519013601/http://www.msf.org/our-staff |archive-date=19 May 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Private donors provide about 90% of the organisation's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$1.63&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.msf.org/sites/msf.org/files/msf_financial_report_2016_final.pdf|title=MSF International Financial Report 2016|access-date=2021-07-11}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><!-- page 89: Total programme expenses listed as 669.1 million Euros, converted to US dollars gives 755 million -->

{{lang|fr|Médecins Sans Frontières}} was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the [[Nigerian Civil War|Biafra secession]], by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to [[medical care]] across national boundaries and irrespective of [[Race (classification of humans)|race]], [[religion]], creed or political affiliation.<ref name=creation>{{cite web |url=http://www.msf.fr/histoire-sommaire-book-page/1971-creation-medecins-sans-frontieres |title=La création de Médecins Sans Frontières |id=La création de Médecins Sans Frontières |publisher=Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without borders) |access-date=14 September 2011 |language=fr}}</ref> To that end, the organisation emphasises "independence and impartiality", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisations. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the [[Rwandan genocide|1994 genocide in Rwanda]], has the organisation called for military intervention.

MSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter,<ref>MSF Article [http://www.msf.org.uk/about_charter.aspx MSF's Charter – About MSF  – MSF UK] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421050920/http://www.msf.org.uk/about_charter.aspx |date=21 April 2008 }} '''MSF'''.

MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres ([[Amsterdam]], [[Barcelona]]-[[Athens]], [[Brussels]], [[Geneva]] and [[Paris]]). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in [[Geneva]], Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.

MSF has [[List of organizations with consultative status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council|general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council]].

==Origin==

===Biafra===
[[File:Starved girl.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A child with [[kwashiorkor]] during the [[Nigerian Civil War]]]]

During the [[Nigerian Civil War]] of 1967 to 1970, the Nigerian military formed a [[blockade]] around the nation's newly [[secession|independent]] south-eastern region, [[Biafra]]. At this time, France was one of the only major countries supportive of the Biafrans (the United Kingdom, the [[Soviet Union]] and the United States sided with the Nigerian government), and the conditions within the blockade were unknown to the world. A number of French doctors volunteered with the French [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] to work in hospitals and feeding centres in besieged Biafra.<ref name=creation/> One of the co-founders of the organisation was [[Bernard Kouchner]], who later became a high-ranking French politician.

After entering the country, the volunteers, in addition to Biafran [[health professional|health workers]] and hospitals, were subjected to attacks by the [[Nigerian Armed Forces|Nigerian army]], and witnessed civilians being murdered and starved by the blockading forces. The doctors publicly criticised the Nigerian government and the Red Cross for their seemingly complicit behaviour. These doctors concluded that a new aid organisation was needed that would ignore political/religious boundaries and prioritise the welfare of victims.<ref name=creation/>
Apart from Nigeria, MSF exists in several African countries including Benin, Zambia, Uganda, Kenya, South Africa, Rwanda, Sudan, Sierra Leone, etc.

===1971 establishment===
The ''Groupe d'intervention médicale et chirurgicale en urgence'' ("Emergency Medical and Surgical Intervention Group") was formed in 1971 by French doctors who had worked in Biafra, to provide aid and to emphasize the importance of victims' rights. At the same time, [[Raymond Borel]], the editor of the French [[medical journal]] ''TONUS'', had started a group called ''Secours Médical Français'' ("French Medical Relief") in response to the [[1970 Bhola cyclone]], which killed at least 625,000 in [[East Pakistan]] (now Bangladesh). Borel had intended to recruit doctors to provide aid to victims of natural disasters. On 22 December 1971, the two groups of colleagues merged to form ''Médecins Sans Frontières''.<ref name="hih"/>

MSF's first mission was to the Nicaraguan capital, [[Managua]], where a [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake|1972 earthquake]] had destroyed most of the city and killed between 10,000 and 30,000 people.<ref>Bortolotti, above, puts the death toll at 10,000. An estimate of 15,000 to 30,000, warning of an inevitable dysentery epidemic, comes from: {{Cite journal |author=Camilo, V |year=1974 |title=The Earthquake in Managua |journal=The Lancet |volume=303 |issue=7845 |pages=25–26 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(74)93014-1|pmid=4129001 }}</ref> The organization, today known for its quick response in an emergency, arrived three days after the Red Cross had set up a relief mission. On 18 and 19 September 1974, [[Hurricane Fifi]] caused major flooding in Honduras and killed thousands of people (estimates vary), and MSF set up its first long-term medical relief mission.<ref>MSF Article [http://www.medecinssansfrontieres.com/site/site.nsf/pages/70 Chronologies: Années 70 (French)] '''MSF-France'''. Retrieved 10 January 2006.</ref>

Between 1975 and 1979, after [[South Vietnam]] had fallen to [[North Vietnam]], millions of Cambodians emigrated to Thailand to avoid the [[Khmer Rouge]].<ref name="Dromi_2020">{{cite book |last1=Dromi |first1=Shai M. |title=Above the Fray: The Red Cross and the Making of the Humanitarian NGO Sector |date=2020 |publisher=Univ. of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=9780226680101 |page=126 |url=https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/A/bo46479924.html}}</ref> In response MSF set up its first [[refugee camp]] missions in Thailand.<ref name="hih"/> When Vietnam withdrew from Cambodia in 1989, MSF started long-term relief missions to help survivors of [[The Killing Fields|the mass killings]] and reconstruct the country's health care system.<ref>MSF Article (1999) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=751B6EAC-B3D6-11D4-B1FA0060084A6370&method=full_html Cambodia's second chance] '''MSF'''. Retrieved 10 January 2006.</ref> Although its missions to Thailand to help victims of war in Southeast Asia could arguably be seen as its first war-time mission, MSF saw its first mission to a true war zone, including exposure to hostile fire, in 1976. MSF spent nine years (1976–1984) assisting surgeries in the hospitals of various cities in Lebanon, during the [[Lebanese Civil War]], and established a reputation for its neutrality and willingness to work under fire. Throughout the war, MSF helped both [[Lebanese Civil War#Christian militias|Christian]] and [[Lebanese Civil War#Shi'a militias|Muslim soldiers]] alike, helping whichever group required the most medical aid at the time. In 1984, as the situation in Lebanon deteriorated further and security for aid groups was minimised, MSF withdrew its volunteers.

==History==

=== 1970s ===
[[Claude Malhuret]] was elected as the new president of Medicins Sans Frontieres in 1977, and soon after debates began over the future of the organisation. In particular, the concept of ''témoignage'' ("witnessing"), which refers to speaking out about the suffering that one sees as opposed to remaining silent,<ref>MSF Article (2005) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?objectid=F75AB4F5-E018-0C72-093A3A517D56EB33&component=toolkit.article&method=full_html MSF's principles and identity – The challenges ahead] '''MSF'''. Retrieved 10 January 2006.</ref> was being opposed or played down by Malhuret and his supporters. Malhuret thought MSF should avoid criticism of the governments of countries in which they were working, while Kouchner believed that documenting and broadcasting the suffering in a country was the most effective way to solve a problem.

In 1979, after four years of refugee movement from South Vietnam and the surrounding countries by foot and [[Vietnamese boat people|by boat]], French intellectuals made an appeal in ''[[Le Monde]]'' for "A Boat for Vietnam", a project intended to provide medical aid to the refugees. Although the project did not receive support from the majority of MSF, some, including later Minister [[Bernard Kouchner]], chartered a ship called ''L’Île de Lumière'' ("The Island of Light"), and, along with doctors, journalists and photographers, sailed to the [[South China Sea]] and provided some medical aid to the boat people. The splinter organisation that undertook this, [[Médecins du Monde]], later developed the idea of [[humanitarian intervention]] as a duty, in particular on the part of Western nations such as France.<ref>Richard Seymour, ''The Liberal Defense of Murder'' (London 2008), p. 174.</ref> In 2007 MSF clarified that for nearly 30 years MSF and Kouchner have had public disagreements on such issues as the right to intervene and the use of armed force for humanitarian reasons. Kouchner is in favour of the latter, whereas MSF stands up for an impartial humanitarian action, independent from all political, economic and religious powers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/press/release.cfm?id=2053 |title=Dr. Bernard Kouchner and MSF: A Clarification, 22 May 2007 |publisher=Doctorswithoutborders.org |access-date=3 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927220144/http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/press/release.cfm?id=2053 |archive-date=27 September 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

===1980s===
In 1982, Malhuret and [[Rony Brauman]] (who became the organisation's president in 1982) brought increased financial independence to MSF by introducing fundraising-by-mail to better collect donations. The 1980s also saw the establishment of the other operational sections from MSF-France (1971): MSF-Belgium (1980), MSF-Switzerland (1981), MSF-Holland (1984), and MSF-Spain (1986). MSF-Luxembourg was the first support section, created in 1986. The early 1990s saw the establishment of the majority of the support sections: MSF-Greece (1990), MSF-USA (1990), MSF-Canada (1991), MSF-Japan (1992), MSF-UK (1993), MSF-Italy (1993), MSF-Australia (1994), as well as Germany, Austria, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Hong Kong (MSF-UAE was formed later).<ref name="hih"/><ref name="various">Information obtained from the various sections' websites.</ref> Malhuret and Brauman were instrumental in professionalising MSF. In December 1979, after the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet army had invaded Afghanistan]], field missions were immediately set up to provide medical aid to the [[mujahideen]], and in February 1980, MSF publicly denounced the [[Khmer Rouge]]. During the [[1983–1985 famine in Ethiopia]], MSF set up nutrition programmes in the country in 1984, but was expelled in 1985 after denouncing the abuse of international aid and the forced resettlements. MSF's explicit attacks on the Ethiopian government led to other NGOs criticizing their abandonment of their supposed neutrality and contributed to a series of debates in France around humanitarian ethics.<ref>[http://www.allacademic.com//meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/5/1/6/6/pages251669/p251669-1.php Denis Kennedy, "Humanitarian NGOs and the Norm of Neutrality: A Community Approach"]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Davey |first=Eleanor |title=Famine, aid, and ideology: the political activism of Médecins Sans Frontières in the 1980s |journal=French Historical Studies |year=2011 |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=529–58 |doi=10.1215/00161071-1259157}}</ref>  The group also set up equipment to produce clean [[drinking water]] for the population of [[San Salvador]], capital of El Salvador, after 10 October 1986 earthquake that struck the city.<ref name="hih"/><ref name="frchrono80">MSF Article [http://www.medecinssansfrontieres.com/site/site.nsf/pages/80 Chronologie: Années 80 (French)] '''MSF-France'''.

[[Kala-azar]], also known as [[visceral leishmaniasis]], has been one of the major health problems in [[Sudan]]. After the Comprehensive Peace Agreement between North and Southern Sudan on 9 January 2005, the increase in stability within the region helped further efforts in healthcare delivery.

The early 1990s saw MSF open a number of new national sections, and at the same time, set up field missions in some of the most dangerous and distressing situations it had ever encountered.

MSF first began work in [[Srebrenica]] (in Bosnia and Herzegovina) as part of a UN convoy in 1993, one year after the [[Bosnian War]] had begun. The city had become surrounded by the [[Bosnian Serb Army]] and, containing about 60,000 [[Bosniaks]], had become an enclave guarded by a [[United Nations Protection Force]]. MSF was the only organisation providing medical care to the surrounded civilians, and as such, did not denounce the genocide for fear of being expelled from the country (it did, however, denounce the lack of access for other organisations). MSF was forced to leave the area in 1995 when the [[Bosnian Serb Army]] captured the town. 40,000 [[Bosnian Muslims|Bosniak]] civilian inhabitants were deported, and approximately 7,000 were killed in mass executions.<ref>MSF Article (2000) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=751B6F1E-B3D6-11D4-B1FA0060084A6370&method=full_html Srebrenica five years on] '''MSF'''.

===Rwanda===
When the [[genocide in Rwanda]] began in April 1994, some delegates of MSF working in the country were incorporated into the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) medical team for protection. Both groups succeeded in keeping all main hospitals in Rwanda's capital [[Kigali]] operational throughout the main period of the genocide. MSF, together with several other aid organisations, had to leave the country in 1995, although many MSF and ICRC volunteers worked together under the ICRC's rules of engagement, which held that neutrality was of the utmost importance. These events led to a debate within the organisation about the concept of balancing neutrality of humanitarian aid workers against their witnessing role. As a result of its Rwanda mission, the position of MSF with respect to neutrality moved closer to that of the ICRC, a remarkable development in the light of the origin of the organisation.<ref>Forsythe DP (2005).

The ICRC lost 56 and MSF lost almost one hundred of their respective local staff in Rwanda, and MSF-France, which had chosen to evacuate its team from the country (the local staff were forced to stay), denounced the murders and demanded that a [[Military of France|French military]] intervention stop the genocide. MSF-France introduced the slogan ''"One cannot stop a genocide with doctors"'' to the media, and the controversial [[Opération Turquoise]] followed less than one month later.<ref name="hih"/> This intervention directly or indirectly resulted in movements of hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees to [[Zaire]] and Tanzania in what became known as the [[Great Lakes refugee crisis]], and subsequent cholera epidemics, starvation and more mass killings in the large groups of civilians. MSF-France returned to the area and provided medical aid to refugees in [[Goma]].<ref>[http://www.msf.fr/site/actu.nsf/actus/msfen1994 One cannot stop a genocide with doctors (French)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210082737/http://www.msf.fr/site/actu.nsf/actus/msfen1994 |date=10 December 2006 }} '''MSF-France'''.

In 1999, the organisation spoke out about the lack of humanitarian support in Kosovo and Chechnya, having set up field missions to help civilians affected by the respective political situations. Although MSF had worked in the Kosovo region since 1993, the onset of the [[Kosovo War]] prompted the movement of tens of thousands of refugees, and a decline in suitable living conditions. MSF provided shelter, water and health care to civilians affected by [[Operation Allied Force|NATO's strategic bombing campaigns]].<ref>MSF Article (2000) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=6589C7EE-DC2C-11D4-B2010060084A6370&method=full_html Kosovo: The physical and psychological consequences of war] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222439/http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=6589C7EE-DC2C-11D4-B2010060084A6370&method=full_html |date=27 September 2007 }} '''MSF'''.

A serious crisis within MSF erupted in connection with the organisation's work in Kosovo when the Greek section of MSF was expelled from the organization. The Greek MSF section had gained access to Serbia at the cost of accepting Serb government imposed limits on where it could go and what it could see – terms that the rest of the MSF movement had refused.<ref>Urbinski, James.

Faced with more than 1.5&nbsp;million people displaced from their homes, MSF set up relief programmes in [[internally displaced person]] (IDP) camps to provide clean water, food and sanitation.

MSF first provided medical help to civilians and refugees who have escaped to camps along the Thai-Cambodian border in 1979. Due to long decades of war, a proper [[health care]] system in the country was severely lacking and MSF moved inland in 1989 to help restructure basic medical facilities.

In 1999, Cambodia was hit with a malaria epidemic. The situation of the epidemic was aggravated by a lack of qualified practitioners and poor quality control which led to a market of fake antimalarial drugs. Counterfeit antimalarial drugs were responsible for the deaths of at least 30 people during the epidemic.<ref name="cdcarticle">[https://www.cdc.gov/malaria/malaria_worldwide/reduction/counterfeit.html CDC Article (2010) Counterfeit and Substandard Antimalarial Drugs.

Cambodia is one of the hardest hit HIV/AIDS countries in Southeast Asia. In 2001, MSF started introducing antiretroviral (ARV) therapy to AIDS patients for free. This therapy prolongs the patients' lives and is a long-term treatment.<ref name="msrarticle">{{Cite web |url=http://doctorswithoutborders.org/news/article.cfm?id=1508&cat=field-news |title=MSF Article (2004) AIDS in Cambodia: A Second Chance at Life.

Cambodia is one of 22 countries listed by WHO as having a high burden of tuberculosis. WHO estimates that 64% of all Cambodians carry the tuberculosis mycobacterium.

===Libya===
The [[2011 Libyan civil war]] has prompted efforts by MSF to set up a hospital and mental health services to help locals affected by the conflict. The fighting created a backlog of patients that needed surgery. With parts of the country slowly returning to livable, MSF has started working with local health personnel to address the needs. The need for psychological counseling has increased and MSF has set up mental health services to address the fears and stress of people living in tents without water and electricity. Currently MSF is the only International Aid organisation with actual presence in the country.

===Mediterranean Sea===
MSF is providing Maritime Search And Rescue (SAR) services on the Mediterranean Sea to save the lives of migrants attempting to cross with unseaworthy boats. The Mission started in 2015 after the EU ended its major SAR [[operation Mare Nostrum]] severely diminishing much needed SAR capacities in the Mediterranean.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/country-region/mediterranean-sea |title=Mediterranean Sea: Latest MSF Updates October 4, 2017 |access-date=17 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180218090835/http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/country-region/mediterranean-sea |archive-date=18 February 2018 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Throughout the mission MSF has operated its own vessels like the ''[[Bourbon Argos]]'' (2015–2016), ''[[Sea-Watch 3#Dignity 1|Dignity 1]]'' (2015–2016) and ''[[VOS Prudence]]'' (2016–2017). MSF has also provided medical teams to support other NGOs and their ships like the [[Migrant Offshore Aid Station|MOAS]] ''[[Phoenix (1973)|Phoenix]]'' (2015) or the ''[[Aquarius (NGO ship)|Aquarius]]'' (2017–2018) and ''[[Ocean Viking]]'' (2019-2020) with [[SOS Méditerranée]]<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://searchandrescue.msf.org/ |title = Search and Rescue – MSF}}</ref> and [[Mediterranea Saving Humans]].

In December 2018 MSF and SOS Méditerranée were forced to end operations of the ''[[Aquarius (NGO ship)|Aquarius]]'', at that date the last remaining vessel supported by MSF. This came after attacks by EU states that stripped the vessel of its registration and produced criminal accusations against MSF.

===Sri Lanka===
MSF is involved in Sri Lanka, where a [[Sri Lankan Civil War|26 year civil war]] ended in 2009 and MSF has adapted its activities there to continue its mission.

===Yemen===
{{See also|Airstrikes on hospitals in Yemen}}
MSF is involved in trying to help with the humanitarian crisis caused by the [[Yemeni Civil War (2015–present)|Yemeni Civil War]]. The organisation operates eleven hospitals and health centres in Yemen and provides support to another 18 hospitals or health centres.<ref name="msf.org.uk">{{Cite web | url=https://www.msf.org.uk/article/yemen-staff-and-patients-killed-after-airstrike-hits-abs-hospital | title=Yemen: Staff and patients killed after airstrike hits Abs Hospital| date=15 August 2016}}</ref> According to MSF, since October 2015, four of its hospitals and one ambulance have been destroyed by Saudi-led coalition airstrikes.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.msf.org.uk/country/yemen | title=Yemen| date=11 September 2016}}</ref> In August 2016, an airstrike on Abs hospital killed 19 people, including one MSF staff member, and wounded 24.<ref name="msf.org.uk"/> According to MSF, the GPS coordinates of the hospital were repeatedly shared with all parties to the conflict, including the Saudi-led coalition, and its location was well-known.

==Field mission structure==
Before a field mission is established in a country, an MSF team visits the area to determine the nature of the humanitarian emergency, the level of safety in the area and what type of aid is needed (this is called an "exploratory mission").

Medical aid is the main objective of most missions, although some missions help in such areas as [[water purification]] and nutrition.<ref>[http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/aboutus/what.cfm Field Operations: What Do We Do?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316011210/http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/aboutus/what.cfm |date=16 March 2006 }} '''MSF'''.

===Field mission team===
[[File:MSF logistician showing plans.jpg|thumb|MSF logistician in [[Nigeria]] showing plans]]

A field mission team usually consists of a small number of coordinators to head each component of a field mission, and a "head of mission." The head of mission usually has the most experience in humanitarian situations of the members of the team, and it is his/her job to deal with the media, national governments and other humanitarian organizations. The head of mission does not necessarily have a medical background.

Medical volunteers include physicians, surgeons, nurses, and various other specialists. In addition to operating the medical and nutrition components of the field mission, these volunteers are sometimes in charge of a group of local medical staff and provide training for them.

Although the medical volunteers almost always receive the most media attention when the world becomes aware of an MSF field mission, there are a number of non-medical volunteers who help keep the field mission functioning. Logisticians are responsible for providing everything that the medical component of a mission needs, ranging from security and vehicle maintenance to food and electricity supplies. They may be engineers and/or [[Construction foreman|foremen]], but they usually also help with setting up treatment centres and supervising local staff. Other non-medical staff are water/sanitation specialists, who are usually experienced engineers in the fields of water treatment and management and financial/administration/human resources experts who are placed with field missions.

===Medical component===
[[File:Preparing to enter Ebola treatment unit (2).jpg|thumb|Doctors from MSF and the American [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] put on protective gear before entering an [[Ebola]] treatment ward in [[Liberia]], August 2014]]

Vaccination campaigns are a major part of the medical care provided during MSF missions. Diseases such as [[diphtheria]], [[measles]], [[meningitis]], [[tetanus]], [[pertussis]], [[yellow fever]], [[polio]], and [[cholera]], all of which are uncommon in developed countries, may be prevented with [[vaccination]]. Some of these diseases, such as cholera and measles, spread rapidly in large populations living in close proximity, such as in a refugee camp, and people must be immunised by the hundreds or thousands in a short period of time.<ref>MSF Article (2003) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=2371723C-A340-45A4-919DDF2685CD9289&method=full_html The Vaccine Gap: NY Times editorial] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015853/http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=2371723C-A340-45A4-919DDF2685CD9289&method=full_html |date=30 September 2007 }} '''MSF'''.

MSF is the only source of treatment for many countries in Africa, whose citizens make up the majority of people with HIV and AIDS worldwide.<ref name="whoaids"/> Because antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) are not readily available, MSF usually provides treatment for [[opportunistic infection]]s and educates the public on how to slow transmission of the disease.<ref>MSF Article (2004) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=6746E5F4-0A5B-4C1E-B9EFCB10C8509248&method=full_html World AIDS Day MSF country profiles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930020129/http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=6746E5F4-0A5B-4C1E-B9EFCB10C8509248&method=full_html |date=30 September 2007 }} '''MSF'''.

Since most of the areas that require field missions have been affected by a natural disaster, civil war, or endemic disease, the residents usually require psychological support as well.

===Nutrition===
Often in situations where an MSF mission is set up, there is moderate or severe [[malnutrition]] as a result of war, drought, or government economic mismanagement. Intentional starvation is also sometimes used during a war as a weapon, and MSF, in addition to providing food, brings awareness to the situation and insists on foreign government intervention. Infectious diseases and [[diarrhoea]], both of which cause weight loss and weakening of a person's body (especially in children), must be treated with medication and proper nutrition to prevent further infections and weight loss. A combination of the above situations, as when a civil war is fought during times of drought and infectious disease outbreaks, can create famine.<ref>MSF Article (2000) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=71282930-EC70-11D4-B2010060084A6370&method=full_html Preventing malnutrition and famine] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222723/http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=71282930-EC70-11D4-B2010060084A6370&method=full_html |date=27 September 2007 }} '''MSF'''.

In emergency situations where there is a lack of nutritious food, but not to the level of a true famine, [[protein-energy malnutrition]] is most common among young children. [[Marasmus]], a form of calorie deficiency, is the most common form of childhood malnutrition and is characterised by severe wasting and often fatal weakening of the immune system. [[Kwashiorkor]], a form of calorie and protein deficiency, is a more serious type of malnutrition in young children, and can negatively affect [[Human development (biology)|physical]] and [[Developmental psychology|mental development]]. Both types of malnutrition can make opportunistic infections fatal.<ref>MSF Article (2001) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=CB803D87-94DC-423E-98E2485EAAAC0873&method=full_html Malnutrition definition and MSF treatment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222348/http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=CB803D87-94DC-423E-98E2485EAAAC0873&method=full_html |date=27 September 2007 }} '''MSF'''.

A Therapeutic Feeding Centre (or Therapeutic Feeding Programme) is designed to treat severe malnutrition through the gradual introduction of a special diet intended to promote weight gain after the individual has been treated for other health problems. The treatment programme is split between two phases:<ref>MSF Article (2001) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=38EE4ACD-E76C-419D-8888955E03EF9E13&method=full_html MSF Therapeutic Feeding Programmes] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930015539/http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=38EE4ACD-E76C-419D-8888955E03EF9E13&method=full_html |date=30 September 2007 }} '''MSF'''.

* Phase 1 lasts for 24 hours and involves basic health care and several small meals of low energy/protein food spaced over the day.
* Phase 2 involves monitoring of the patient and several small meals of high energy/protein food spaced over each day until the individual's weight approaches normal.

MSF uses foods designed specifically for treatment of severe malnutrition. During phase 1, a type of therapeutic milk called [[F-75 (food)|F-75]] is fed to patients.

[[Dehydration]], sometimes due to [[diarrhoea]] or cholera, may also be present in a population, and MSF set up rehydration centres to combat this. A special solution called [[Oral rehydration salt|Oral Rehydration Solution]] (ORS), which contains [[Glucose#Function|glucose]] and [[Cell electrolyte|electrolytes]], is given to patients to [[Fluid replacement|replace fluids lost]].

===Statistics===
In order to accurately report the conditions of a humanitarian emergency to the rest of the world and to governing bodies, data on a number of factors are collected during each field mission. The rate of malnutrition in children is used to determine the malnutrition rate in the population, and then to determine the need for feeding centres.<ref>MSF Article (2002) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=09972681-0B23-4AF6-B488A0B4A177C6CF&method=full_html Malnutrition: rates and measures] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930020239/http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=09972681-0B23-4AF6-B488A0B4A177C6CF&method=full_html |date=30 September 2007 }} '''MSF'''.

In addition to epidemiological surveys, MSF also uses population [[Statistical survey|surveys]] to determine the rates of violence in various regions.

==Epicentre==

In 1986, MSF created Epicentre, an in-house research organization, to support its activities. Epicentre conducts training, publishes scientific papers and develops new techniques for MSF. It performs epidemiological research, conducts clinical vaccine trials during outbreaks MSF is responding to, experiments on vaccine stability, and analysis of vaccine deployment strategy.<ref>[https://epicentre.msf.org/en/epicentre/mission Who We Are?]</ref>

==Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines==
{{Main|Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines}}

The Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines was initiated in 1999 to increase access to [[essential medicines]] in developing countries. "Essential medicines" are those drugs that are needed in sufficient supply to treat a disease common to a population.<ref>WHO Health topic [https://www.who.int/topics/essential_medicines/en/ Essential Medicines]</ref> However, most diseases common to populations in developing countries are no longer common to populations in developed countries; therefore, [[pharmaceutical company|pharmaceutical companies]] find that producing these drugs is no longer profitable and may raise the price per treatment, decrease development of the drug (and new treatments) or even stop production of the drug. MSF often lacks effective drugs during field missions, and started the campaign to put pressure on governments and pharmaceutical companies to increase funding for essential medicines.

In recent years, the organization has tried to use its influence to urge the drug maker [[Novartis]] to drop its case against India's patent law that prevents Novartis from patenting its drugs in [[India]]. A few years earlier, Novartis also sued [[South Africa]] to prevent it from importing cheaper [[AIDS]] drugs. Dr. Tido von Schoen-Angerer, director of DWB's Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines, says, "Just like five years ago, Novartis, with its legal actions, is trying to stand in the way of people's right to access the medicines they need."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web1.doctorswithoutborders.org/press/release.cfm?id=1908&cat=press-release |title=MSF Urges Novartis to Drop Case Against Indian Government &#124; Doctors Without Borders |publisher=Web1.doctorswithoutborders.org |date=20 December 2006 |access-date=3 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404055800/http://web1.doctorswithoutborders.org/press/release.cfm?id=1908&cat=press-release |archive-date=4 April 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

On 1 April 2013, it was announced that the Indian court invalidated Novartis's patent on Gleevec. This decision makes the drug available via generics on the Indian market at a considerably lower price.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-india-novartis-patent-idUSBRE93002I20130401 |work=Reuters |access-date=1 April 2013 |title=Novartis loses landmark India cancer drug patent case |date=1 April 2013 |archive-date=1 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401104520/http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/04/01/us-india-novartis-patent-idUSBRE93002I20130401 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Dangers faced by volunteers==
Aside from injuries and death associated with stray bullets, mines and epidemic disease, MSF volunteers are sometimes attacked or kidnapped for political reasons. In some countries afflicted by civil war, humanitarian-aid organizations are viewed as helping the enemy. If an aid mission is perceived to be exclusively set up for victims on one side of the conflict, it may come under attack for that reason. However, the [[War on Terrorism]] has generated attitudes among some groups in US-occupied countries that non-governmental aid organizations such as MSF are allied with or even work for the [[Multinational force in Iraq|Coalition forces]]. Since the United States has labelled its operations "humanitarian actions," independent aid organizations have been forced to defend their positions, or even evacuate their teams.<ref>MSF Article (2004) [http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=762E8B7B-2F5F-448A-8EC26F2039794E54&method=full_html Military humanitarianism: A deadly confusion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514040456/http://www.msf.org/msfinternational/invoke.cfm?component=article&objectid=762E8B7B-2F5F-448A-8EC26F2039794E54&method=full_html |date=14 May 2006 }} '''MSF'''.

And her face had been so carefully disfigured that a pattern was obvious in the slashes.  She was one among many—living an inhuman and simply indescribable suffering.  We could do little more for her at the moment than stop the bleeding with a few necessary sutures.  We were completely overwhelmed, and she knew that there were so many others.  She said to me in the clearest voice I have ever heard, 'Allez, allez…ummera, ummerasha'—'Go, go…my friend, find and let live your courage.' | James Orbinski | Nobel acceptance speech for MSF}}

Orbinski affirmed the organization's commitment to publicizing the issues MSF encountered, stating<ref>{{cite web |last=MSF Article (1999) |title=The Nobel Peace Prize speech |url=http://www.msf.org/article/nobel-peace-prize-speech |work=www.msf.org |publisher=MSF |access-date=7 October 2013}}</ref>

{{quote | Silence has long been confused with neutrality, and has been presented as a necessary condition for humanitarian action. From its beginning, MSF was created in opposition to this assumption. We are not sure that words can always save lives, but we know that silence can certainly kill. | James Orbinski}}
==Lasker Prize==
MSF received the [[Lasker-Bloomberg Public Service Award]] in 2015 from the [[New York City|New York]] based [[Lasker Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/ultimas/2015/09/08/premio-lasker-2015-para-medicos-sin-fronteras-8995.html |title=2015 Lasker Prize for MSF (in Spanish) |publisher=Jornada.unam.mx |date=2015-09-08 |access-date=2016-07-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422061632/http://www.jornada.unam.mx/ultimas/2015/09/08/premio-lasker-2015-para-medicos-sin-fronteras-8995.html/ |archive-date=22 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Namesakes==

The French game show ''[[Jeux Sans Frontières]]'' ("Games Without Frontiers") is older, being first broadcast in Europe in 1965. 

A number of other non-governmental organizations have adopted names ending in "Sans Frontières" or "Without Borders", inspired by Médecins Sans Frontières: for example, [[Engineers Without Borders]], [[Avocats Sans Frontières]] (Lawyers Without Borders), [[Reporters sans frontières ]] (Reporters Without Borders), Charpentiers sans frontières (Carpenters Without Borders), [[Payasos Sin Fronteras]] (Clowns Without Borders), [[Bibliothèques Sans Frontières]] and [[Homeopaths Without Borders]].

==Controversies==
===2019–20 Hong Kong protests===
During the [[2019–20 Hong Kong protests]], there were conflicts between the civilians and the police. Some injured protesters feared arrest if they sought medical assistance from government hospitals, and some sought assistance from MSF.<ref>[https://news.ltn.com.tw/amp/news/world/breakingnews/2958538 香港人反抗》示威傷者被迫求「私醫」 醫護集會籲警克制]，自由時報，2019-10-26</ref> 

In October, conflicts erupted at multiple universities in Hong Kong, with police using tear gas. MSF stated that they considered the state medical assistance to be adequate, but were heavily criticised by supporters of the protests, including artists [[Gregory Wong]] and [[Gloria Yip]] who stated that they would no longer donate to MSF.<ref>[https://msf.hk/18771 無國界醫生（香港）回應有關近日查詢] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191118160113/https://msf.hk/18771 |date=18 November 2019 }}，2019-11-19</ref><ref>[http://www.passiontimes.hk/article/11-18-2019/57643 無國界醫生評估小組：香港醫療資源與救援能力充足]，熱血時報，2019.11.18</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=【恥與為伍】藝人群起與無國界醫生割席 王宗堯：香港人唔會再捐錢畀你|url=https://hk.entertainment.appledaily.com/enews/realtime/article/20191119/60283850|access-date=2019-11-19|work=Apple Daily 蘋果日報}}</ref>
