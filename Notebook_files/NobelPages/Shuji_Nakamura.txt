{{nihongo|'''Shuji Nakamura'''|中村 修二|Nakamura Shūji|extra=born May 22, 1954}} is a Japanese-born American [[electronic engineer]] and [[list of prolific inventors|prolific inventor]] specializing in the field of [[semiconductor]] technology, professor at the Materials Department of the [[UCSB College of Engineering|College of Engineering]], [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] (UCSB),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engr.ucsb.edu/faculty/profile/82|title=Shuji Nakamura|access-date=July 31, 2008|publisher=[[University of California]]|place=Santa Barbara|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715103346/http://www1.engr.ucsb.edu/faculty/profile/82|archive-date=July 15, 2010}}</ref> and is regarded as the inventor of the blue [[Light-emitting diode|LED]], a major breakthrough in lighting technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pacbiztimes.com/2014/10/10/laureate-fought-the-odds-to-make-history |title=Nobel laureate fought the odds to make history|access-date=Oct 10, 2014|publisher=Pacific Coast Business Times}}</ref> 

Together with [[Isamu Akasaki]] and [[Hiroshi Amano]], he is one of the three recipients of the [[Nobel Prize in Physics|2014 Nobel Prize for Physics]] "for the invention of efficient blue light-emitting diodes, which has enabled bright and energy-saving white light sources". In 2015, his input into commercialization and development of energy-efficient white LED lighting technology was recognized by the [[Global Energy Prize]]. In 2021, Nakamura, along with <!--Isamu -->Akasaki, [[Nick Holonyak]], [[M. George Craford]] and [[Russell D. Dupuis]] were awarded the [[Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering]] "for the creation and development of LED lighting, which forms the basis of all solid state lighting technology".<ref name=QEPrize>https://qeprize.org/winners/led-lighting</ref>

== Career ==
Nakamura graduated from the [[University of Tokushima]] in 1977 with a [[Bachelor of Engineering|B.Eng.]] degree in [[electronic engineering]], and obtained an [[Master of Engineering|M.Eng.]] degree in the same subject two years later, after which he joined the [[Nichia|Nichia Corporation]], also based in [[Tokushima]]. It was while working for Nichia that Nakamura invented the method for producing the first commercial high brightness [[gallium nitride]] (GaN) LED whose brilliant [[blue]] light, when partially converted to yellow by a phosphor coating, is the key to white LED lighting, which went into production in 1993.

Previously, J.&nbsp;I. Pankove and co-workers at [[RCA]] put in considerable effort, but did not manage to make a marketable GaN LED in the 1960s. The principal problem was the difficulty of making strongly [[Extrinsic semiconductor#P-type semiconductors|p-type]] GaN.{{sfnp|Johnstone|2007|pp=90–93}} Nakamura drew on the work of another Japanese group led by Professor [[Isamu Akasaki]], who published their method to make strongly p-type GaN by electron-beam irradiation of magnesium-doped GaN; however, this method was not suitable for mass production. Nakamura managed to develop a thermal annealing method which was much more suitable for mass production.{{sfnp|Johnstone|2007|p=114}} In addition, he and his co-workers worked out the physics and pointed out the culprit was hydrogen, which passivated acceptors in GaN.{{sfnp|Johnstone|2007|pp=114, 116}}

At the time, many considered creating a GaN LED too difficult to produce; therefore Nakamura was fortunate that the founder of Nichia, {{illm|Nobuo Ogawa|ja| 小川信雄 (実業家)}}(1912–2002), was willing to support and fund his GaN project.<ref name=normile/>{{sfnp|Johnstone|2007|p=68}} However, the senior Ogawa ceded the presidency to his son-in-law Eiji Ogawa (in 1989), and the company under Eiji's direction ordered him to suspend work on GaN, claiming it was consuming too much time and money.{{sfnp|Johnstone|2007|pp=103–104}}<ref name=jt20020920/> Nakamura continued to develop the blue LED on his own and in 1993 succeeded in making the device.{{sfnp|Johnstone|2007|pp=112–120}}<ref name=jt20020920/>

Despite these circumstances, once Nakamura succeeded in creating a commercially viable prototype, 3 orders of magnitude (more than 100 times) brighter than previously successful blue LEDs, Nichia pursued developing the marketable product.<ref name=normile/>{{sfnp|Johnstone|2007|pp=120–121}} The company's gross receipt surged from just over ¥20 billion yen(≈US$200 million) in 1993 to ¥80 billion(≈US$800 million) by 2001, 60 percent of which was accounted for by sales of blue LED products.<ref name=jt20020920/> The company's workforce doubled between 1994 and 1999 from 640 to 1300 employees.{{sfnp|Johnstone|2007|p=122}}

Nakamura was awarded a [[Doctor of Engineering|D.Eng.]] degree from the University of Tokushima in 1994.  He left Nichia Corporation in 1999 and took a position as a professor of engineering at the University of California, Santa Barbara.

In 2001, Nakamura sued his former employer Nichia over his bonus for the discovery as a part of a series of lawsuits between Nichia and Nakamura with Nichia's US competitor [[Cree Inc.]]; they agreed in 2000 to jointly sue Nichia at the expense of Cree and Nakamura received stock options from Cree. Nakamura claimed that he received only {{JP¥|20,000|link=yes}} (≈{{US$|180|link=yes}}) for his discovery of "404 patent," though Nichia's president Eiji Ogawa's side of the story was that he was shocked beyond belief that the court would award Nakamura ¥20 billion, and downplaying the significance of the "404 patent," opined that the company had adequately compensated him for the innovation through promotions and bonuses amounting to ¥62 million over 11 years and annual salary which was raised to ¥20 million by the time Nakamura quit Nichia.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nichia kagaku kōgyō no Ogawa Eiji shi: soshō sōdō no shinjitsu wo ima koso akiraka ni suru |script-title=ja:日亜化学工業社長の小川英治氏 訴訟騒動の真実を今こそ明らかにする |trans-title=Nichia president Eiji Ogawa [says] I am now going to clarify the truth behind the lawsuit <!--Series: 食い違うそれぞれの「真実」 日亜化学工業社長と中村氏/「青色LED訴訟」の深層 The conflicting 'truths' [from] Nichia and Mr. Nakamura, the deeper side of the Blue LED lawsuit-->|publisher=Nikkei Tech-on |url=http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/NEWS/nakamura/mono200404_2.html |language=ja |date=April 2004 |access-date=1 December 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141007160518/http://techon.nikkeibp.co.jp/NEWS/nakamura/mono200404_2.html |archive-date=7 October 2014}}</ref>

Nakamura sued for ¥2 billion (<US$20 million) as his fair share for the invention, and the district court awarded him ten times the amount, ¥20 billion (<US$200 million). However, Nichia appealed the award and the parties settled in 2005 for ¥840 million (≈US$8.1 million, less than 5% of the award amount), which was still the largest payment ever paid by a Japanese company to an employee for an invention;<ref>{{cite news|last=Zaun |first=Todd |date=January 12, 2005 |title=Japanese Company to Pay Ex-Employee $8.1 Million for Invention |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/12/business/worldbusiness/12light.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=October 7, 2014}}</ref>{{sfnp|Johnstone|2007|pp=233–237}} an amount only enough to cover legal expenses incurred by Nakamura.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/d4f26220-e1ec-11db-af9e-000b5df10621|title=Book Review: The man who had the world's brightest idea | author=Robert Matthews. |publisher=Financial Times |date=3 April 2007 | access-date=6 April 2021}}</ref>
