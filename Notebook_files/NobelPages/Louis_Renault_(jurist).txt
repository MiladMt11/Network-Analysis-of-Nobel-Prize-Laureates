'''Louis Renault''' (21 May 1843 – 8 February 1918) was a [[France|French]] jurist and educator, the co-winner in 1907 (with [[Ernesto Teodoro Moneta]]) of the [[Nobel Prize for Peace]].

Renault was born at [[Autun]]. From 1868 to 1873 Renault was professor of [[Roman law#Roman law today|Roman]] and [[commercial law]] at the [[University of Dijon]]. From 1873 until his death he was professor in the faculty of law at the [[University of Paris]], where in 1881 he became professor of international law. In 1890 he was appointed [[jurisconsult]] of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a post created for him in which he scrutinized French foreign policy in the light of international law. He served at numerous conferences in this capacity, notably at the two [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)]] and the [[London Naval Conference (1908–1909)]].

Renault was prominent as an arbitrator, his more famous cases including the Japanese House Tax case of 1905, the Casa Blanca Case of 1909, the [[Vinayak Damodar Savarkar#Case before the Permanent Court of Arbitration|Sarvarkar Case]] of 1911, the [[Carthage]] case of 1913, and the [[Manouba]] case of 1913. Among his writings are articles and monographs on the specialized topics of international law. Together with his friend and colleague C. Lyon-Caen, he produced several works on commercial law, including a [[compendium]] in two volumes, a treatise in eight volumes, and a manual that ran to many editions.

In 1879 Renault published his Introduction to the Study of International Law and in 1917 First Violations of International Law by Germany, concerning the [[Western Front (World War I)#1914—German invasion of France and Belgium|invasion of Belgium]] and of [[Luxembourg]] in breach of [[Germany]]'s treaty obligations.
