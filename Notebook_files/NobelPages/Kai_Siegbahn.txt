'''Kai Manne Börje Siegbahn''' (20 April 1918 – 20 July 2007) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[physics|physicist]] who was awarded the 1981 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Kai Siegbahn, Swedish Physicist, Dies at 89|author=Jeremy Pearce |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/07/world/europe/07siegbahn.html |work=[[New York Times]] |date=August 7, 2007 |access-date=2007-07-21 }}</ref>

==Biography==
Siegbahn was born in [[Lund]], Sweden, son of [[Manne Siegbahn]] the 1924 physics Nobel Prize winner. Siegbahn earned his doctorate at the [[University of Stockholm]] in 1944. He was professor at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] 1951–1954, and then professor of experimental physics at [[Uppsala University]] 1954–1984, which was the same chair his father had held. He shared the 1981 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] with [[Nicolaas Bloembergen]] and [[Arthur Leonard Schawlow|Arthur Schawlow]] for their work in [[laser]] [[spectroscopy]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hagstrom, Stig B.|author-link=Stig Hagström|title=Obituary: Kai Manne Börje Siegbahn|journal=Physics Today|date=November 2007|volume=60|issue=11|pages=74–75|doi=10.1063/1.2812132|bibcode = 2007PhT....60k..74H |doi-access=free}}</ref>

Siegbahn obtained the Nobel Prize for developing the method of Electron Spectroscopy for Chemical Analysis (ESCA), now usually described as [[X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy]] (XPS). At the time of his death he was still active as a scientist at the Ångström Laboratory at [[Uppsala University]].
