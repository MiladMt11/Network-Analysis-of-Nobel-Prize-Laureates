'''Henry Way Kendall''' (December 9, 1926 – February 15, 1999)<ref name="nobel-bio">{{Nobelprize}}</ref> was an American particle physicist who won the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1990 jointly with [[Jerome Isaac Friedman]] and [[Richard E. Taylor]] "for their pioneering investigations concerning [[deep inelastic scattering]] of [[electron]]s on [[proton]]s and bound [[neutron]]s, which have been of essential importance for the development of the [[quark model]] in particle physics."<ref name="nobel-citation">{{cite web |url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1990/ |title=Nobel prize citation |publisher=Nobelprize.org |access-date=2011-01-08}}</ref>

==Biography==
Kendall was born in [[Boston]] to Evelyn Way and [[Henry P. Kendall]], an industrialist. Kendall grew up in [[Sharon, Massachusetts]] and attended [[Deerfield Academy]].<ref name="MIT-obit">{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1999/kendall.html |title=MIT Nobelist Henry Kendall dies at 72 while scuba diving in Florida lake |author=Sales, Robert J |date=1999-02-16 |publisher=MIT News Office |access-date=2011-01-08}}</ref> He enrolled in the [[United States Merchant Marine Academy|U. S. Merchant Marine Academy]] in 1945, and served on a troop transport on the North Atlantic in the winter of 1945 – 1946.

In 1946, he enrolled at [[Amherst College]] where he majored in mathematics, graduating in 1950. While at Amherst, he operated a [[Underwater diving|diving]] and [[marine salvage]] company during two summers.  He co-authored two books, one on shallow water diving and the other on [[underwater photography]].

He did graduate research at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], involving an experimental study of [[positronium]], and he obtained his PhD in 1955.  He then spent the next two years as a postdoctoral fellow at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]].  He then spent five years in [[Robert Hofstadter]]'s research group at [[Stanford University]] in the late 1950s and early 1960s, where he worked with [[Jerome Isaac Friedman|Jerome Friedman]] and [[Richard E. Taylor|Richard Taylor]], studying the structure of [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s, using the university's 300 feet long [[Linear particle accelerator|linear electron accelerator]].  He developed a close working relationship with [[Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky]] at Stanford.

Kendall joined the faculty of the [[MIT Physics Department]] in 1961, where he remained until his death in 1999. He was named Julius A. Stratton Professor of Physics in 1991.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Collection: Henry W. Kendall papers {{!}} MIT ArchivesSpace|url=https://archivesspace.mit.edu/repositories/2/resources/1041|access-date=2020-08-25|website=archivesspace.mit.edu}}</ref>

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Kendall worked in collaboration with researchers at the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]] (SLAC) including Friedman and Taylor. These experiments involved scattering high-energy beams of [[electron]]s from [[proton]]s and [[deuteron]]s and heavier [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]]. At lower energies, it had already been found that the electrons would only be scattered through low angles, consistent with the idea that the [[nucleon]]s had no internal structure.  However, the SLAC-MIT experiments showed that higher energy electrons could be scattered through much higher angles, with the loss of some energy.  These deep inelastic scattering results provided the first experimental evidence that the protons and neutrons were made up of point-like particles, later identified to be the [[Up quark|up]] and [[Down quark|down]] [[quark]]s that had previously been proposed on theoretical grounds.<ref name=LATimes1990>{{cite news |author1=Dye, Lee |author2=Maugh II, Thomas H |date=1990-10-18 |title=Four U.S.-Based Scientists Share Nobel Prizes |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-10-18/news/mn-3365_1_nobel-prize |access-date=2011-01-08}}</ref> The experiments also provided the first evidence for the existence of [[gluon]]s.

Kendall was not only a very accomplished physicist, but also a very skilled mountaineer and photographer. He did extensive rock climbing in [[Yosemite Valley]], followed by expeditions to the [[Andes]], [[Himalaya]] and [[Antarctica]], photographing his experiences with large format cameras. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1982.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter K|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterK.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=14 April 2011}}</ref> On April 7, 2012, the [[American Alpine Club]] inducted Kendall into its Hall of Mountaineering Excellence at an award ceremony in [[Golden, Colorado]].<ref>{{cite news

==Service activities==
Kendall was one of the founding members of the [[Union of Concerned Scientists]] (UCS) in 1969.<ref name="MIT-obit"/> He served as chairman of the board of the UCS from 1974 until his death in 1999.<ref name=LATimesOliver>{{cite news |author=Oliver, Myrna |date=1999-02-17 |title=Henry Kendall; Nobel Prize-Winning Nuclear Scientist |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/feb/17/news/mn-8938 |access-date=2011-01-08}}</ref> His public policy interests included avoiding [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]], the [[B-2 Spirit|B2 bomber]], [[Nuclear safety|nuclear reactor safety]] and [[global warming]].
