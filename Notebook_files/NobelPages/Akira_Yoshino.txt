==Research==
[[File:Akira Yoshino cropped 1 Akira Yoshino 201910.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Akira Yoshino]]
In 1981 Yoshino began research on rechargeable batteries using [[polyacetylene]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Fehrenbacher |first=Katie |title=A conversation with a lithium-ion battery pioneer  |url=https://www.greenbiz.com/article/conversation-lithium-ion-battery-pioneer |date=26 April 2018 |publisher=GreenBiz |access-date=10 October 2019 |quote=It was over 35 years ago, in 1981, when I started my research on batteries....This research initiative started not fully focused on batteries.

In 1983 Yoshino fabricated a prototype rechargeable battery using [[lithium cobalt oxide]] (LiCoO{{sub|2}}) (discovered in 1979 by Godshall et al. at Stanford University,<ref>N. A. Godshall, I. D. Raistrick, and R. A.

Polyacetylene had low real [[density]] which meant high capacity required large battery volume, and also had problems with instability, so Yoshino switched to carbonaceous material as anode and in 1985 fabricated the first prototype of the LIB and received the basic patent.<ref name="profile2" /><ref name="Basic1">{{Ref patent | title = Secondary Battery | country=US | number=4668595 | gdate = 9 May 1986| inventor=Yoshino; Akira| assign1=Ashahi Kasei}}, Priority Data 10 May 1985, by Espacenet Patent search</ref><ref name="Basic2">{{Cite web|

This was the birth of the current lithium-ion battery.<ref name="profile2" />

The LIB in this configuration was commercialized by [[Sony]] in 1991 and by A&T Battery in 1992.<ref>{{cite web |author=Masaki Yoshio |author2=Akiya Kozawa |author3=Ralph J.

Yoshino discovered that carbonaceous material with a certain crystalline structure was suitable as anode material,<ref name="Basic1" /><ref name="Basic2" />  and this is the anode material that was used in the first generation of commercial LIBs.

The LIB's coil-wound structure was conceived by Yoshino to provide large electrode surface area and enable high current discharge despite the low conductivity of the organic electrolyte.<ref name="profile2" />

In 1986 Yoshino commissioned the manufacture of a batch of LIB prototypes.<ref name="profile2" /> Based on safety test data from those prototypes, the [[United States Department of Transportation]] (DOT) issued a letter stating that the batteries were different from the metallic [[lithium battery]].<ref>Lithium-ion secondary battery (Japanese) 2nd edition, chapter 2 "History of development of lithium-ion secondary battery", P27-33, Nikkan Kogyo Shimbun (1996)</ref>
