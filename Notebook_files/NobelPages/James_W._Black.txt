'''Sir James Whyte Black''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OM|FRS|FRSE|FRCP}} (14 June 1924 – 22 March 2010<ref name="ObitSTV"/>) was a Scottish [[physician]] and [[Pharmacology|pharmacologist]]. Black established a Veterinary Physiology department at the [[University of Glasgow]], where he became interested in the effects of [[adrenaline]] on the [[human heart]]. He went to work for [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI Pharmaceuticals]] in 1958 and, while there, developed [[propranolol]], a [[beta blocker]] used for the treatment of heart disease.<ref name="Black JW, Crowther AF, Shanks RG, Smith LH, Dornhorst AC 1964 1080–1081">{{cite journal|vauthors=Black JW, Crowther AF, Shanks RG, Smith LH, Dornhorst AC |title=A new adrenergic betareceptor antagonist | journal=[[The Lancet]] |volume=283 |issue=7342 |pages=1080–1081 |year=1964 |pmid=14132613 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(64)91275-9}}</ref> Black was also responsible for the development of [[cimetidine]], an H2 receptor antagonist, a drug used to treat [[stomach ulcers]]. He was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize for Medicine]] in 1988 for work leading to the development of [[propranolol]] and [[cimetidine]].<ref name="nobel"/><ref>[http://www.webofstories.com/people/james.black James Black tells his life story] at [[Web of Stories]]</ref>

== Early life and education ==
Black was born on 14 June 1924 in [[Uddingston]], Lanarkshire, the fourth of five sons of a [[Baptist Union of Scotland|Baptist]] family which traced its origins to [[Balquhidder]], Perthshire.<ref name="autobio"/> His father was a mining engineer.<ref name="autobio"/> He was brought up in Fife, educated at [[Beath High School]], [[Cowdenbeath]], and, at the age of 15, won a scholarship to the [[University of St Andrews]].<ref name="autobio"/> His family had been too poor to send him to university and he had been persuaded to sit the St Andrews entrance exam by his maths teacher at Beath.<ref name="record"/>

Until 1967, [[University of Dundee|University College, Dundee]] was the site for all clinical medical activity for the [[University of St Andrews]]. He matriculated at University College (which eventually became the [[University of Dundee]]) in 1943 and graduated from [[University of St Andrews School of Medicine]] with an MB ChB in 1946.<ref name="Archives, Records and Artefacts">{{cite web|title=Death of Sir James Black|url=http://www.archives-records-artefacts.blogspot.com/2010/03/it-is-with-great-sadness-that-we.html|publisher=Archives, Records and Artefacts at the University of Dundee|access-date=20 March 2015|date=23 March 2010}}</ref> During his time at St Andrews, Black lived in [[St Salvator's Hall]].

After graduating, he stayed at University College to join the physiology department as an assistant lecturer before taking a lecturer position at King Edward VII College of Medicine in Singapore that subsequently became part of the [[University of Malaya]].<ref name="Archives, Records and Artefacts"/><ref name="telegraph"/> Black had decided against a career as a medical practitioner as he objected to what he considered the insensitive treatment of patients at the time.<ref name="telegraph"/>

== Career ==
Black had large debts upon his graduation from university, so he took a teaching job in Singapore for three years, before moving to London in 1950<ref name="AP">{{cite news|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5i2Ues0zJeT4AJpCxJoQTN4odqhCQD9EJUOF00|title=Heart disease treatment pioneer James Black dies|date=22 March 2010|publisher=Associated Press|access-date=25 March 2010}}</ref> and then on to join the [[University of Glasgow]] (Veterinary School) where he established the Veterinary Physiology Department and developed an interest in the way [[adrenaline]] affects the [[human heart]], particularly in those suffering from [[Angina pectoris|angina]].<ref name="age"/> Having formulated a theory of an approach by which the effects of adrenaline might be annulled, he joined [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI Pharmaceuticals]] in 1958, remaining with the company until 1964, during which time he invented [[propranolol]],<ref name="Black JW, Crowther AF, Shanks RG, Smith LH, Dornhorst AC 1964 1080–1081"/> which later became the world's best-selling drug.<ref name="age"/> During this time Black pioneered a method of research whereby drug molecules were purposefully built instead of being synthesised first and then investigated for their potential medical uses.<ref name="telegraph"/> The discovery of propranolol was hailed as the greatest breakthrough in the treatment of heart disease since the discovery of [[digitalis#Uses|digitalis]].<ref name="age"/>

At the same time, Black was developing a similar method of inventing drugs for treatment of [[stomach ulcers]], but ICI did not wish to pursue the idea so Black resigned in 1964 and joined [[Smith, Kline and French]] where he worked for nine years until 1973.<ref name="WoS"/> While there, Black developed his second major drug, [[cimetidine]], which was launched under the brand name Tagamet in 1975 and soon outsold propranolol to become the world's largest-selling prescription drug.<ref name="age"/>

Black was appointed professor, and head of department, of pharmacology at [[University College London]] in 1973 where he established a new undergraduate course in [[medicinal chemistry]]<ref name="autobio"/> but he became frustrated by the lack of funding for research and accepted the post of director of therapeutic research at the [[Wellcome Research Laboratories]] in 1978.<ref name="telegraph"/> However he did not agree with his immediate boss there, [[John Vane|Sir John Vane]], and resigned in 1984.<ref name="telegraph"/> Black then became Professor of Analytical Pharmacology at the Rayne Institute of [[King's College London]] medical school, where he remained until 1992.<ref name="telegraph"/> He established the James Black Foundation in 1988 with funding from [[Johnson & Johnson]] and led a team of 25 scientists in drugs research, including work on [[gastrin]] inhibitors which can prevent some stomach cancers.<ref name="telegraph"/>

Black contributed to basic scientific and clinical knowledge in [[cardiology]], both as a physician and as a basic scientist. His invention of [[propranolol]], the [[beta blocker|beta adrenergic receptor antagonist]] that revolutionised the medical management of [[angina pectoris]], is considered to be one of the most important contributions to clinical medicine and [[pharmacology]] of the 20th century.<ref name="propranolol"/><ref name="tagamet"/> Propranolol has been described as the greatest breakthrough in heart disease treatments since the 18th century discovery of [[digitalis]] and has benefited millions of people.<ref name="telegraph"/> Black's method of research, his discoveries about adrenergic pharmacology, and his clarification of the mechanisms of cardiac action are all strengths of his work.<ref name="scotpaper"/>

He was greatly involved in the synthesis of [[cimetidine]], at the time a revolutionary drug for the treatment and prevention of [[peptic ulcer]]s. Cimetidine was the first of a new class of drugs, the [[H2-receptor antagonist|H<sub>2</sub>-receptor antagonist]]s.

=== Chancellor of the University of Dundee ===
In 1980, Black's association with the [[University of Dundee]] was renewed when the institution recognised his many achievements by conferring him with the Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws. In 1992 he accepted an offer to succeed the [[Simon Ramsay, 16th Earl of Dalhousie|16th Earl of Dalhousie]] as [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the University and was installed as Chancellor at the award ceremony held in [[Dundee Repertory Theatre]] on 29 April 1992. Appropriately the first degree he conferred was to Professor [[Robert Campbell Garry]], who had been responsible for his original appointment at University College Dundee. Sir James remarked at this ceremony that by returning to Dundee he was "in a real sense, coming home".<ref name="Archives, Records and Artefacts"/>

As Chancellor, Sir James Black did much to promote the University of Dundee and was a popular figure within the University. He was awarded a second honorary degree, that of Doctor of Science, in 2005. He retired from his post the following year, and his association with the University of Dundee was marked with launching of the £20 million Sir James Black Centre. The centre, intended to promote interdisciplinary research in the life sciences, was opened by [[Sydney Brenner]] in 2006. Sir James Black himself visited the centre in October 2006 and was reportedly excited and pleased by what he saw.<ref name="Archives, Records and Artefacts"/>

A portrait of Black in his chancellor's robes, by Helene Train, is held as part of the University's fine art collection.<ref name="Uniportrait">{{cite web|title=Sir James Black (1924–2010), Chancellor of the University of Dundee|url=http://artuk.org/discover/artworks/sir-james-black-19242010-chancellor-of-the-university-of-dundee-91236/search/collection:university-of-dundee-fine-art-collections-1445/page/2|website=Art UK|publisher=Public Catalogue Foundation|access-date=23 December 2016}}</ref>

== Honours and awards ==
Black was made a [[Knight Bachelor]] on 10 February 1981 for services to medical research, receiving the honour from the Queen at [[Buckingham Palace]].<ref name="age"/><ref name="GazetteOne"/> On 26 May 2000 he was appointed to the [[Order of Merit]], of which there are only 24 members at any one time, by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]].<ref name="GazetteTwo"/><ref name="Diffin"/>

Black was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1976|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1976]]<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McGrath|first=John Christie|last2=Bond|first2=Richard A.|date=2020|title=Sir James Whyte Black OM. 14 June 1924—22 March 2010|url=https://doi.org/10.1098/rsbm.2019.0047|journal=Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society|volume=70}}</ref> and the same year he was awarded the [[Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research|Lasker award]].<ref name="lasker"/> His certificate of election to the [[Royal Society]] reads: <blockquote>Has made outstanding contributions, based on fundamental considerations of receptor theory, to the development of new drugs of clinical importance. Introduced the first effective beta blockers and analysed their cardiovascular effects. These drugs have opened up new perspectives for the treatment of angina pectoris, cardiac irregularities and hypertension. More recently, in a concerted drive carried out with great vision, he has developed a new type of histamine antagonist capable of inhibiting gastric acid secretion induced by [[histamine]] or [[pentagastrin]]. Apart from its practical implications this work has considerable fundamental importance since it provided evidence for the existence of a new type of histamine receptor. This work has also provided experimental support for the hypothesis that endogenous histamine may be involved in the secretion of acid in the stomach.<ref name=frs>{{cite web

In the town of [[Lochgelly]], [[Fife]], there is a street called Sir James Black Gait.

On 23 November 2018, the University of Glasgow renamed the West Medical Building in honour of Black. Professor Sir Anton Muscatelli, Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Glasgow, said: “Sir James was undoubtedly one of the greatest scientists of the modern age. Through his commitment, intellect and insight he achieved a global impact and his discoveries continue to improve the lives of many.” The unveiling of a plaque was attended by Sir James Black’s wife, Professor Rona Mackie Black, Emeritus Professor and Senior Research Fellow in Public Health within the University's Institute of Health and Wellbeing.

'''James Black Place''' at [[Ninewells Hospital]] is named in his honour.

==Personal life==
Black met Hilary Joan Vaughan (1924–1986) at a university ball in 1944 and the couple married in 1946 upon his graduation. He described her as the "mainspring" of his life until she died aged 61 in [[Surrey]].<ref name="autobio"/><ref name="Wife"/> The couple had a daughter, Stephanie, born in 1951.<ref name="autobio"/> Black remarried in 1994, to Professor [[Rona MacKie]].<ref name="telegraph"/> Black was a very private man who was averse to publicity and was horrified to discover he had won the Nobel Prize.<ref name="telegraph"/>

Black died, aged 85, on the morning of 22 March 2010 after a long illness. His death was announced by the [[University of Dundee]], where Black served as Chancellor from 1992 to 2006.<ref name="BBC"/> His funeral was held on 29 March at St. Columba's Church, London.<ref name="AP"/> He is buried at the Ardclach cemetery, a parish established in 1655, near Nairn, Scotland. Upon hearing of Black's death, Professor Pete Downes, Principal and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Dundee said Black "was a great scientist, but he was also a great man to know" while the [[BBC]] said he was "hailed as one of the great Scottish scientists of the 20th Century".<ref name="Diffin"/> He was described by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' as the man who earned the most for the [[pharmaceutical industry]] through his drug development, though he received little personal financial gain from his work.<ref name="telegraph"/>

Shortly after his death the [[University of St Andrews School of Medicine|Bute Medical School]] of the University of St Andrews, where Black had studied for his initial degree in medicine, announced that an honorary 'Sir James Black Chair of Medicine' would be created.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/news/archive/2010/title,49622,en.php |title=Alumnus Sir James Black passes away aged 85 |date=23 March 2010 |website=University of St Andrews |language=en |access-date=20 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003095405/http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/news/archive/2010/title,49622,en.php |archive-date=3 October 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In September 2010 the first Chair of Medicine at the University was given to Professor Stephen H Gillespie MD, DSc, FRCP (Edin), FRC Path, who left his post as Professor of Medical Microbiology at [[University College London|UCL]].{{cn|date=March 2018}}
