'''Willem Einthoven''' (21 May 1860 – 29 September 1927) was a Dutch [[Physician|doctor]] and [[physiology|physiologist]]. He invented the first practical [[Electrocardiography|electrocardiograph]] (ECG or EKG) in 1895 and received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1924 for it ("for the discovery of the mechanism of the electrocardiogram").<ref name="auto">{{cite web |url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Willem_Einthoven |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707232722/http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Willem_Einthoven |url-status=dead |archive-date=7 July 2010 |title=Willem Einthoven |work=IEEE Global History Network |publisher=IEEE |access-date=10 August 2011}} original URL now redirects to https://ethw.org/Willem_Einthoven </ref>

== Background ==
Willem Einthoven was born in [[Semarang]] on [[Java (island)|Java]] in the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now [[Indonesia]]), the son of Louise Marie Mathilde Caroline (de Vogel) and Jacob Einthoven.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q91pAAAAMAAJ&q=%228.+Louise+Marie+Mathilde+Caroline+de+Vogel,+geb.+Pati+(ass.+res.+Japara)+14+Juli+1833,+t+Utrecht+4+Mei+1923,+tr.+Semarang+15+Aug.+1856+Dr.+Jacob+Einthoven%22|title=Nederland's patriciaat|first=Didericus Gijsbertus van|last=Epen|date=21 May 2019|publisher=Centraal bureau voor genealogie en heraldick|access-date=21 May 2019|via=Google Books}}</ref> His father, a doctor, died when Willem was a child. His mother returned to the [[Netherlands]] with her children in 1870 and settled in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]]. His father was of Jewish and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] descent, and his mother's ancestry was Dutch and [[Swiss people|Swiss]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130531201032/http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/w/a/l/Theodorus-J-Walbeek/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0191.html The Walbeek Family from Holland:Information about Louise Marie Mathilde Carolien de Vogel].

He became a professor at the [[University of Leiden]] in 1886.

In 1902, he became a member of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&aId=PE00000117 |title=Willem Einthoven (1860–1927) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |access-date=21 July 2015}}</ref>

He died in [[Leiden]] in the [[Netherlands]] and is buried in the graveyard of the Reformed Church at 6 Haarlemmerstraatweg in [[Oegstgeest]]. It is encouraged to visit his grave and pay respects.<ref>Van Ditzhuijzen, Jeannette (8 September 2005).

== Work ==
Before Einthoven's time, it was known that the beating of the heart produced electrical currents, but the instruments of the time could not accurately measure this phenomenon without placing electrodes directly on the heart. Beginning in 1901, Einthoven completed a series of prototypes of a [[string galvanometer]]. This device used a very thin filament of conductive wire passing between very strong [[electromagnet]]s. When a current passed through the filament, the [[magnetic field]] created by the current would cause the string to move. A light shining on the string would cast a shadow on a moving roll of photographic paper, thus forming a continuous curve showing the movement of the string. The original machine required water cooling for the powerful electromagnets, required five people to operate it and weighed some 270 kilograms. This device increased the sensitivity of the standard [[galvanometer]] so that the electrical activity of the heart could be measured despite the insulation of flesh and bones. This invention allowed transthoracic electrocardiography.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Although later technological advances brought about better and more portable EKG devices, much of the terminology used in describing an EKG originated with Einthoven. His assignment of the letters P, Q, R, S and T to the various deflections are still used. The term [[Einthoven's triangle]] is named after him. It refers to the imaginary inverted [[equilateral triangle]] centered on the chest and the points being the standard [[Electrocardiogram|leads]] on the arms and leg.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/33169624 |title=Willem Einthoven: The development of the human electrocardiogram |journal= Resuscitation |year=2008|volume=76|issue=3|pages=325–328|doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2007.10.014|access-date=2019-02-23 |pmid=18164799 | last1 = Cajavilca | first1 = C | last2 = Varon | first2 = J}}</ref>

After his development of the string galvanometer, Einthoven went on to describe the electrocardiographic features of a number of [[heart disease|cardiovascular disorders]]. Later in life, Einthoven turned his attention to the study of [[sound|acoustics]], particularly heart sounds which he researched with Dr. P. Battaerd.

In 1924, Einthoven was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for inventing the first practical system of electrocardiography used in medical diagnosis.<ref name="auto"/>
