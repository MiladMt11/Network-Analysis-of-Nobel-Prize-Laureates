'''Fritz Haber''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfʁɪt͡s ˈhaːbɐ|-|De-Fritz Haber.ogg}}; 9 December 1868&nbsp;– 29 January 1934) was a German<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Fritz-Haber|title=Fritz Haber {{!}} Biography & Facts|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=19 March 2018|language=en}}</ref> [[chemist]] who received the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1918 for his invention of the [[Haber process|Haber–Bosch process]], a method used in industry to synthesize [[ammonia]] from [[nitrogen]] gas and [[hydrogen]] gas. This invention is of importance for the large-scale synthesis of [[fertilizer]]s and [[Explosive material|explosives]]. It is estimated that two thirds of annual global food production uses nitrogen from the Haber–Bosch process, and that this supports nearly half the world population.<ref>{{cite book|first=Vaclav|last=Smil|date=2004|title=Enriching the Earth: Fritz Haber, Carl Bosch, and the Transformation of World Food Production|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|publisher=[[MIT Press]]|isbn=9780262693134|page=156}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|first=Claudia |last=Flavell-While|title=Fritz Haber and Carl Bosch – Feed the World |url=https://www.thechemicalengineer.com/features/cewctw-fritz-haber-and-carl-bosch-feed-the-world/|access-date=30 April 2021|website=www.thechemicalengineer.com}}</ref> Haber, along with [[Max Born]], proposed the [[Born–Haber cycle]] as a method for evaluating the [[lattice energy]] of an ionic solid. Haber is also considered the "father of [[chemical warfare]]" for his years of pioneering work developing and weaponizing [[chlorine#Use as a weapon|chlorine]] and other poisonous gases during [[World War I]], especially his actions during the [[Second Battle of Ypres]].

==Early life and education==
Haber was born in [[Wrocław|Breslau]] (now Wrocław, Poland), [[Prussia]], into a well-off [[Jews|Jewish]] family.<ref name="Goran" />{{rp|38}} The family name Haber was a common one in the area, but Haber's family has been traced back to a great-grandfather, Pinkus Selig Haber, a wool dealer from [[Kępno|Kempen]] (now Kępno, Poland). An important Prussian edict of 13 March 1812 determined that Jews and their families, including Pinkus Haber, were "to be treated as local citizens and citizens of Prussia". Under such regulations, members of the Haber family were able to establish themselves in respected positions in business, politics, and law.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|3–5}}

Haber was the son of Siegfried and Paula Haber, first cousins who married in spite of considerable opposition from their families.<ref name=Charles>{{cite book|last1=Charles|first1=Daniel|title=Master mind : the rise and fall of Fritz Haber, the Nobel laureate who launched the age of chemical warfare|date=2005|publisher=Ecco|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0-06-056272-4|edition=1.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b3W7Fk63dbIC&pg=PT15|access-date=8 September 2014}}</ref> Haber's father Siegfried was a well-known merchant in the town, who had founded his own business in dye pigments, paints and pharmaceuticals.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|6}} Paula experienced a difficult pregnancy and died three weeks after Fritz's birth, leaving Siegfried devastated and Fritz in the care of various aunts.<ref name="Stoltzenberg">{{cite book|title=Fritz Haber : Chemist, Nobel laureate, German, Jew|last1=Stoltzenberg|first1=Dietrich|date=2004|publisher=Chemical Heritage Foundation|isbn=978-0-941901-24-6|location=Philadelphia}}<!--|access-date=8 September 2014--></ref>{{rp|11}} When Haber was about six years old, Siegfried remarried, to Hedwig Hamburger. Siegfried and his second wife had three daughters, Else, Helene and Frieda. Although his relationship with his father was distant and often difficult, Haber developed close relationships with his step-mother and his half-sisters.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|7}}

By the time Fritz was born, the Habers had to some extent assimilated into German society. He attended primary school at the Johanneum School, a "simultaneous school" open equally to Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish students.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|12}} At age 11, he went to school at the St. Elizabeth classical school, in a class evenly divided between Protestant and Jewish students.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|14}} His family supported the Jewish community and continued to observe many Jewish traditions, but were not strongly associated with the synagogue.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|15}} Haber identified strongly as German, less so as Jewish.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|15}}

Haber successfully passed his examinations at the St. Elizabeth High School in Breslau in September 1886.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|16}} Although his father wished him to apprentice in the dye company, Haber obtained his father's permission to study chemistry, at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin (today the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]]), with the director of the Institute for Chemistry, [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann|A. W. Hofmann]].<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|17}} Haber was disappointed by his initial winter semester (1886–87) in Berlin, and arranged to attend the [[Heidelberg University]] for the summer semester of 1887, where he studied under [[Robert Bunsen]].<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|18}} 
He then returned to Berlin, to the Technical College of Charlottenburg (today the [[Technical University of Berlin]]).<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|19}} 

In the summer of 1889 Haber left university to perform his [[One-year volunteer]] service in the Sixth Field Artillery Regiment.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|20}} Upon its completion, he returned to Charlottenburg where he became a student of [[Carl Liebermann]]. In addition to Liebermann's lectures on organic chemistry, Haber also attended lectures by Otto Witt on the chemical technology of dyes.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|21}} 

Liebermann assigned Haber to work on reactions with [[piperonal]] for his thesis topic, published as ''Ueber einige Derivate des Piperonals'' (About a Few piperonal Derivatives) in 1891.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ueber einige Derivate des piperonals (cover)|url=http://www.mdma.net/fritz-haber/inaugural-dissertation.html|access-date=8 September 2014}}</ref> Haber received his doctorate ''cum laude'' from Friedrich Wilhelm University in May 1891, after presenting his work to a board of examiners from the University of Berlin, since Charlottenburg was not yet accredited to grant doctorates.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|22}}

With his degree, Haber returned to Breslau to work at his father's chemical business. They did not get along well. Through Siegfried's connections, Haber was assigned a series of practical apprenticeships in different chemical companies, to gain experience. These included Grünwald and Company (a Budapest distillers), an Austrian ammonia-sodium factory, and the Feldmühle paper and cellulose works. Haber realized, based on these experiences, that he needed to learn more about technical processes, and persuaded his father to let him spend a semester at Polytechnic College in [[Zürich]] (now the [[ETH Zürich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]]), studying with [[Georg Lunge]].<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|27–29}} In fall of 1892, Haber returned again to Breslau to work in his father's company, but the two men continued to clash and Siegfried finally accepted that they could not work well together.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|30–31}}

==Early career==
Haber then sought an academic appointment, first working as an independent assistant to [[Ludwig Knorr]] at the [[University of Jena]] between 1892 and 1894.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|32}} During his time in Jena, Haber [[List of converts to Christianity|converted]] from Judaism to Lutheranism, possibly in an attempt to improve his chances of getting a better academic or military position.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|33}} Knorr recommended Haber to [[Karl Engler|Carl Engler]],<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|33}} a chemistry professor at the [[University of Karlsruhe]] who was intensely interested in the chemical technology of dye and the dye industry, and the study of synthetic materials for textiles.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|38}} Engler referred Haber to a colleague in Karlsruhe, [[:de:Hans Bunte|Hans Bunte]], who made Haber an ''Assistent'' in 1894.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|40}}<ref name=NobelBio>{{cite web|title=Fritz Haber – Biographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1918/haber-bio.html|website=Nobelprize.org|publisher=Nobel Media AB 2014|access-date=8 September 2014}}</ref>

Bunte suggested that Haber examine the thermal decomposition of [[hydrocarbon]]s. By making careful quantitative analyses, Haber was able to establish that "the thermal stability of the carbon-carbon bond is greater than that of the carbon-hydrogen bond in aromatic compounds and smaller in aliphatic compounds", a classic result in the study of [[pyrolysis]] of hydrocarbons. This work became Haber's [[habilitation]] thesis.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|40}}

Haber was appointed a [[Privatdozent]] in Bunte's institute, taking on teaching duties related to the area of dye technology, and continuing to work on the combustion of gases. In 1896, the university supported him in traveling to Silesia, Saxony, and Austria to learn about advances in dye technology.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|41}}

In 1897 Haber made a similar trip to learn about developments in [[electrochemistry]].<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|41}} He had been interested in the area for some time, and had worked with another privatdozent, Hans Luggin, who gave theoretical lectures in electrochemistry and physical chemistry. Haber's 1898 book ''Grundriss der technischen Elektrochemie auf theoretischer Grundlage'' (Outline of technical electrochemistry based on theoretical foundations) attracted considerable attention, particularly his work on the reduction of [[nitrobenzene]]. In the book's foreword, Haber expresses his gratitude to Luggin, who died on 5 December 1899.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|42}} Haber collaborated with others in the area as well, including [[Georg Bredig]], a student and later an assistant of [[Wilhelm Ostwald]] in [[Leipzig]].<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|43}}

Bunte and Engler supported an application for further authorization of Haber's teaching activities, and on 6 December 1898, Haber was invested with the title of ''Extraordinarius'' and an associate professorship, by order of the [[Frederick II, Grand Duke of Baden|Grand Duke Friedrich von Baden]].<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|44}}

Haber worked in a variety of areas while at Karlsruhe, making significant contributions in several areas. In the area of dye and textiles, he and Friedrich Bran were able to theoretically explain steps in textile printing processes developed by Adolf Holz. Discussions with Carl Engler prompted Haber to explain [[autoxidation]] in electrochemical terms, differentiating between dry and wet autoxidation. Haber's examinations of the thermodynamics of the reaction of solids confirmed that [[Faraday's laws of electrolysis|Faraday's laws]] hold for the electrolysis of crystalline salts. This work led to a theoretical basis for the [[glass electrode]] and the measurement of electrolytic potentials. Haber's work on irreversible and reversible forms of [[Electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide|electrochemical reduction]] are considered classics in the field of electrochemistry. He also studied the [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivity]] of non-rare metals and the effects of electric current on [[corrosion]] of metals.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|55}} In addition, Haber published his second book, ''Thermodynamik technischer Gasreaktionen : sieben Vorlesungen'' (1905) trans. ''Thermodynamics of technical gas-reactions : seven lectures'' (1908), later regarded as "a model of accuracy and critical insight" in the field of chemical thermodynamics.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|56–58}}

In 1906, Max Le Blanc, chair of the physical chemistry department at Karlsruhe, accepted a position at the University of Leipzig. After receiving recommendations from a search committee, the Ministry of Education in Baden offered the full professorship for physical chemistry at Karlsruhe to Haber, who accepted the offer.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|61}}

==Nobel Prize==
During his time at [[University of Karlsruhe]] from 1894 to 1911, Haber and his assistant [[Robert Le Rossignol]] invented the [[Haber process|Haber–Bosch process]], which is the [[catalytic]] formation of [[ammonia]] from [[hydrogen]] and atmospheric [[nitrogen]] under conditions of high temperature and pressure.<ref name=Hager>{{cite book|first=Thomas|last=Hager|title=The Alchemy of Air|publisher=[[Three Rivers Press]]|location=New York City|date=2008|isbn=978-0-307-35179-1|page=90}}</ref> This discovery was a direct consequence of [[Le Châtelier's principle]], announced in 1884, which states that when a system is in equilibrium and one of the factors affecting it is changed, the system will respond by minimizing the effect of the change. Since it was known how to decompose ammonia on nickel based catalyst, one could derive from Le Châtelier's principle that the reaction could be reversed to produce ammonia at high temperature and pressure (a process that [[Henry Louis Le Châtelier]] had even tried himself but gave up after his technician almost killed himself, due to an oxygen intake related explosion){{Citation needed|reason=According to whom?|date=November 2021}}.

To further develop the process for large-scale ammonia production, Haber turned to industry. Teaming with [[Carl Bosch]] at [[BASF]], the process was successfully scaled up to produce commercial quantities of ammonia.<ref name=Hager /> The Haber–Bosch process was a milestone in industrial chemistry. The production of nitrogen-based products such as [[fertilizer]] and chemical feedstocks, previously dependent on acquisition of ammonia from limited natural deposits, now became possible using an easily available, abundant base&nbsp;— atmospheric nitrogen.<ref name=LandauSymposium>{{cite book|title=Technology & economics: Papers commemorating Ralph Landau's service to the National Academy of Engineering.|date=1991|publisher=National Academy Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-309-04397-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/technologyeconom00land/page/110 110]|url=https://archive.org/details/technologyeconom00land/page/110}}</ref> The ability to produce much larger quantities of nitrogen-based fertilizers in turn supported much greater agricultural yields and prevented billions of people from starving to death.<ref name=Brot />

The discovery of a new way of producing ammonia had other significant economic impacts as well. [[Chile]] had been a major (and almost unique) producer of natural deposits such as [[sodium nitrate]] ([[Caliche (mineral)|caliche]]). After the introduction of the Haber process, naturally extracted nitrate production in Chile fell from 2.5 million tons (employing 60,000 workers and selling at US$45/ton) in 1925 to just 800,000 tons, produced by 14,133 workers, and selling at $19/ton in 1934.<ref name="Collier">{{cite book|title=A history of Chile, 1808–2002|last1=Collier|first1=Simon|last2=Sater|first2=William F.|date=2004|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|location=Cambridge, England|isbn=0521827493<!--[and/]or 9780521534840-->|edition=2nd}}</ref>

The annual world production of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer is currently more than 100 million tons. The food base of half of the current world population is based on the Haber–Bosch process.<ref name=Brot>Albrecht, Jörg (2008) [https://www.faz.net/aktuell/wissen/physik-mehr/100-jahre-haber-bosch-verfahren-brot-und-kriege-aus-der-luft-1713668.html "Brot und Kriege aus der Luft"]. ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung]]''. p. 77 (Data from "Nature Geosience").</ref>

Haber was awarded the 1918 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for this work (he actually received the award in 1919).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1918|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1918/|website=Nobelprize.org|publisher=Nobel Media AB 2014|access-date=8 September 2014}}</ref>
In his acceptance speech for that Nobel Prize Haber commented "It may be that this solution is not the final one. Nitrogen bacteria teach us that Nature, with her sophisticated forms of the chemistry of living matter, still understands and utilizes methods which we do not as yet know how to imitate."<ref name=Smil>{{cite book|first=Vaclav|last=Smil|title=Enriching the Earth Fritz Haber, Carl Bosch, and the Transformation of World Food Production|publisher=[[The MIT Press]]|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|date=February 27, 2004|isbn=978-0262693134|page=231}}</ref>

Haber was also active in the research on [[combustion]] reactions, the separation of gold from sea water, [[adsorption]] effects, [[electrochemistry]], and free radical research (see [[Fenton's reagent]]). A large part of his work from 1911 to 1933 was done at the [[Fritz Haber Institute of the MPG|Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry]] at [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Berlin-Dahlem]]. In 1953, this institute was renamed for him. He is sometimes credited, incorrectly, with first synthesizing [[MDMA]] (which was first synthesized by [[Merck KGaA]] [[chemist]] [[Anton Köllisch]] in 1912).<ref name="Benzenhöfer">{{cite journal | last1 = Benzenhöfer | first1 = U | last2 = Passie | first2 = T | title = The early history of "Ecstasy" | url = http://www.mdma.net/mdma.pdf | journal = Der Nervenarzt | volume = 77 | issue = 1 | pages = 95–6, 98–9 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16397805 | doi = 10.1007/s00115-005-2001-y }}</ref>

==World War I==
Haber greeted World War I with enthusiasm, joining 92 other German intellectuals in signing the ''[[Manifesto of the Ninety-Three]]'' in October 1914.<ref name=ED>{{cite book|last1=Grundmann|first1=Siegfried|title=The Einstein Dossiers: Science and Politics – Einstein's Berlin Period with an Appendix on Einstein's FBI File (translated by A.

He was promoted to the rank of captain and made head of the Chemistry Section in the Ministry of War soon after the war began.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|133}} In addition to leading the teams developing [[chlorine#Use as a weapon|chlorine gas]] and other deadly gases for use in [[trench warfare]],<ref name="Gross">{{cite journal|last1=Gross|first1=Daniel A.|title=Chemical Warfare: From the European Battlefield to the American Laboratory|journal=Distillations|date=Spring 2015|volume=1|issue=1|pages=16–23|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/chemical-warfare-from-the-european-battlefield-to-the-american-laboratory|access-date=20 March 2018}}</ref> Haber was on hand personally when it was first released by the German military at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]] (22 April to 25 May 1915) in [[Belgium]].<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|138}} Haber also helped to develop [[WWI gas mask|gas mask]]s with [[adsorption|adsorbent]] filters which could protect against such weapons.

A special troop was formed for gas warfare (Pioneer Regiments 35 and 36) under the command of Otto Peterson, with Haber and Friedrich Kerschbaum as advisors. Haber actively recruited physicists, chemists, and other scientists to be transferred to the unit. Future Nobel laureates [[James Franck]], [[Gustav Hertz]], and [[Otto Hahn]] served as [[Poison gas in World War I|gas troops]] in Haber's unit.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|136–138}} In 1914 and 1915, before the Second Battle of Ypres, Haber's unit investigated reports that the French had deployed [[Turpenite]], a supposed chemical weapon, against German soldiers.<ref name="Richter 2014">{{cite book | last=Richter | first=D. | title=Chemical Soldiers: British Gas Warfare in World War I | publisher=Pen & Sword Books Limited | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-78346-173-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wAbangEACAAJ |page=6}}</ref>

Gas warfare in World War I was, in a sense, the war of the chemists, with Haber pitted against French Nobel laureate chemist [[Victor Grignard]]. Regarding war and peace, Haber once said, "during peace time a scientist belongs to the World, but during war time he belongs to his country." This was an example of the ethical dilemmas facing chemists at that time.<ref name=Novak>{{cite book|last1=Novak|first1=Igor|title=Science : a many-splendored thing|url=https://archive.org/details/sciencemanysplen00nova|url-access=limited|date=2011|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore|isbn=978-9814304740|pages=247–316|doi=10.1142/9789814304757_0004|chapter=Science and History}}</ref>

Haber was a patriotic German who was proud of his service during World War I, for which he was decorated. He was even given the rank of [[captain (land)|captain]] by the [[Kaiser]], which Haber had been denied 25 years earlier during his compulsory military service.<ref name="Coffey2008">{{cite book|author=Coffey, Patrick |title=Cathedrals of Science: The Personalities and Rivalries That Made Modern Chemistry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UQt6glJEiGsC&pg=PA102|date=29 August 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-971746-0|pages=102–}}</ref>

In his studies of the effects of poison gas, Haber noted that exposure to a low concentration of a poisonous gas for a long time often had the same effect (death) as exposure to a high concentration for a short time. He formulated a simple mathematical relationship between the gas concentration and the necessary exposure time. This relationship became known as [[Haber's rule]].<ref name="GadKaplan1990">{{cite book|author1=Gad, Shayne C. |author2=Kaplan, Harold L. |title=Combustion Toxicology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=088qMHudhRoC&pg=PA99|date=2 October 1990|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4398-0532-9|pages=99–}}</ref><ref name="SalemKatz2014">{{cite book|author1=Salem, Harry |author2=Katz, Sidney A. |title=Inhalation Toxicology, Third Edition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pWULBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA130|date= 2014|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4665-5273-9|pages=130–}}</ref>

Haber defended gas warfare against accusations that it was inhumane, saying that death was death, by whatever means it was inflicted and referred to history: "The disapproval that the knight had for the man with the firearm is repeated in the soldier who shoots with steel bullets towards the man who confronts him with chemical weapons. [...] The gas weapons are not at all more cruel than the flying iron pieces; on the contrary, the fraction of fatal gas diseases is comparatively smaller, the mutilations are missing".<ref name="Haber 1924 p.50">{{cite book | last=Haber | first=Fritz | title=Die Chemie im Kriege fünf Vorträge (1920-1923) über Giftgas, Sprengstoff und Kunstdünger im Ersten Weltkrieg | publisher=Comino Verlag | publication-place=Berlin | year=2020 | isbn=978-3-945831-26-7 | oclc=1136163177 | language=de | page=50}}</ref> During the 1920s, scientists working at his institute developed the [[hydrogen cyanide|cyanide]] gas formulation [[Methyl cyanoformate|Zyklon A]], which was used as an [[insecticide]], especially as a [[fumigation|fumigant]] in [[grain]] stores.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Szöllösi-Janze, M. | title=Pesticides and war: the case of Fritz Haber | journal=European Review | year=2001 | volume=9 | issue=1 | pages=97–108 | doi=10.1017/S1062798701000096 | s2cid=145487024 }}</ref>

==Personal life and family==
[[File:Clara Immerwahr.jpg|thumb|[[Clara Immerwahr]]]]
Haber met [[Clara Immerwahr]] in Breslau in 1889, while he was serving his required year in the military. Clara was the daughter of a chemist who owned a sugar factory, and was the first woman to earn a PhD (in chemistry) at the [[University of Breslau]].<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|20}} She converted from [[Judaism]] to [[Conversion to Christianity|Christianity]] in 1897, several years before she and Haber became engaged.

Her reasons for suicide remain the subject of speculation.

Hermann Haber lived in France until 1941, but was unable to obtain French citizenship. When Germany invaded France during World War II, Hermann and his wife and three daughters escaped internment on a French ship travelling from Marseilles to the Caribbean. From there, they obtained visas allowing them to immigrate to the United States. Hermann's wife Margarethe died after the end of the war, and Hermann committed suicide in 1946.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|182–183}} His oldest daughter, Claire, committed suicide in 1949; also a chemist, she had been told her research into an antidote for the effects of chlorine gas was being set aside, as work on the atomic bomb was taking precedence.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/jun/05/the-forbidden-zone-fritz-haber-barbican-katie-mitchell-review|title=The Forbidden Zone review – poisoned by a 'higher form of killing'|last=Clapp|first=Susannah|date=5 June 2016|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=15 September 2018}}</ref>

Haber's other son, Ludwig Fritz Haber (1921–2004), became an eminent British economist and wrote a history of chemical warfare in World War I,''The Poisonous Cloud'' (1986).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.scs.uiuc.edu/~mainzv/HIST/awards/Dexter%20Papers/HaberDexterBioJJB.pdf | title=Lutz F.

His daughter, Eva, lived in Kenya for many years, returning to England in the 1950s. She died in 2015, leaving three children, five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.

Several members of Haber's extended family died in [[Nazi concentration camps]], including his half-sister Frieda's daughter, Hilde Glücksmann, her husband, and their two children.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|235}}

==Between World Wars==
From 1919 to 1923 Haber continued to be involved in Germany's secret development of chemical weapons, working with [[Hugo Stoltzenberg]], and helping both Spain and Russia in the development of chemical gases.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|169}}

From 1919 to 1925, in response to a request made by German ambassador to Japan [[Wilhelm Solf]] for Japanese support for German scholars in times of financial hardship, a Japanese businessman named Hoshi Hajime, the president of Hoshi Pharmaceutical Company donated two million Reichsmark to the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society]] as the ‘Japan Fund’ (Hoshi-Ausschuss). Haber was asked to manage the fund, and was invited by Hoshi to Japan in 1924. Haber offered a number of chemical licenses to Hoshi's company, but the offers were refused. The money from the Fund was used to support the work of [[Richard Willstätter]], [[Max Planck]], [[Otto Hahn]], [[Leo Szilard]], and others.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sprang |first1=Christian |last2=Kato |first2=Tetsuro |title=Japanese-German Relations 1895-1945 |date=2006 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=041545705X |page=127}}</ref>

In the 1920s, Haber searched exhaustively for a method to extract gold from sea water, and published a number of scientific papers on the subject. After years of research, he concluded that the concentration of gold dissolved in sea water was much lower than those reported by earlier researchers, and that gold extraction from sea water was uneconomic.<ref name="Goran">{{cite book | last=Goran | first=Morris | title=The Story of Fritz Haber | publisher=University of Oklahoma Press | year=1967 | isbn=978-0-8061-0756-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=im24AAAAIAAJ | access-date=30 April 2021 }}</ref>{{rp|91–98}}

By 1931, Haber was increasingly concerned about the rise of [[National Socialism]] in Germany, and the possible safety of his friends, associates, and family. Under the [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]] of 7 April 1933, Jewish scientists at the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Society]] were particularly targeted. The ''Zeitschrift für die gesamte Naturwissenschaft'' ("Journal for all natural sciences") charged that "The founding of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institutes in Dahlem was the prelude to an influx of Jews into the physical sciences. The directorship of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical and Electrochemistry was given to the Jew, F. Haber, the nephew of the big-time Jewish profiteer Koppel". (Koppel was not actually related to Haber.)<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|277–280}} Haber was stunned by these developments, since he assumed that his conversion to Christianity and his services to the state during World War I should have made him a German patriot.<ref name=Hager />{{rp|235–236}} Ordered to dismiss all Jewish personnel, Haber attempted to delay their departures long enough to find them somewhere to go.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|285–286}} As of 30 April 1933, Haber wrote to [[Bernhard Rust]], the national and Prussian minister of Education, and to [[Max Planck]], president of the Kaiser Wilhelm Society, to tender his resignation as the director of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute, and as a professor at the university, effective 1 October 1933. He said that although as a converted Jew he might be legally entitled to remain in his position, he no longer wished to do so.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|280}}

Haber and his son Hermann also urged that Haber's children by Charlotte Nathan, at boarding school in Germany, should leave the country.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|181}} Charlotte and the children moved to the United Kingdom around 1933 or 1934. After the war, Charlotte's children became British citizens.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|188–189}}

==Death==
[[File:Habers in Basel.JPG|thumb|The grave of Fritz and Clara Haber (née Immerwahr) in the Hörnli graveyard of Basel, Switzerland]]
Haber left Dahlem in August 1933, staying briefly in Paris, Spain, and Switzerland. He was in extremely poor health during these travels, eventually suffering fatally from what was either a [[stroke]] or [[heart attack]].<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|288}}

In the meantime, some of the scientists who had been Haber's counterparts and competitors in England during World War I now helped him and others to leave Germany. Brigadier [[Harold B. Hartley|Harold Hartley]], Sir [[William Jackson Pope]] and [[Frederick G. Donnan]] arranged for Haber to be officially invited to [[Cambridge, England]].<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|287–288}} There, with his assistant [[Joseph Joshua Weiss]], Haber lived and worked for a few months.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|288}} Scientists such as [[Ernest Rutherford]] were less forgiving of Haber's involvement in poison gas warfare: Rutherford pointedly refused to shake hands with him.<ref name=Rutherford>{{cite web|title=Remembering Controversial Chemist Fritz Haber|url=http://www.thechemicalblog.co.uk/remembering-controversial-chemist-fritz-haber/|website=The Chemical Blog|access-date=23 January 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016070848/http://www.thechemicalblog.co.uk/remembering-controversial-chemist-fritz-haber/|archive-date=16 October 2014}}</ref>

In 1933, during Haber's brief sojourn in England, [[Chaim Weizmann]] offered him the directorship at the Sieff Research Institute (now the [[Weizmann Institute]]) in [[Rehovot]], in [[Mandatory Palestine]]. He accepted, and left for the Middle East in January 1934, travelling with his half-sister, Else Haber Freyhahn.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|209, 288–289}} His ill health overpowered him and on 29 January 1934, at the age of 65, he died of [[heart failure]], mid-journey, in a [[Basel]] hotel.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|299–300}}

Following Haber's wishes, Haber and Clara's son Hermann arranged for Haber to be cremated and buried in Basel's Hörnli Cemetery on 29 September 1934, and for Clara's remains to be removed from Dahlem and re-interred with him on 27 January 1937 (see picture).<ref name=Stoltzenberg /><ref>A photograph of their gravestone in Hörnli Cemetery, Basel can also be found in the book written by Stoltzenberg.</ref>

==Estate and legacy==
Haber bequeathed his extensive private library to the [[Weizmann Institute of Science|Sieff Institute]], where it was dedicated as the Fritz Haber Library on 29 January 1936. Hermann Haber helped to move the library and gave a speech at the dedication.<ref name=Stoltzenberg />{{rp|182}}

In 1981, the Minerva foundation of the [[Max Planck Society]] and the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] (HUJI) established the Fritz Haber Research Center for Molecular Dynamics, based at the Institute of Chemistry of the Hebrew University. Its purpose is the promotion of Israeli-German scientific collaboration in the field of Molecular Dynamics. The Center's library is also called Fritz Haber Library, but it is not immediately clear if there is any connection to the 1936 homonymous library of the Sieff (now Weizmann) Institute.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The institute most closely associated with his work, the former Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Electrochemistry at Dahlem (a suburb of Berlin), was renamed [[Fritz Haber Institute of the MPG|Fritz Haber Institute]] in 1953 and is part of the Max Planck Society.

==Dramatizations and fictionalizations==
A fictional description of Haber's life, and in particular his longtime relationship with [[Albert Einstein]], appears in Vern Thiessen's 2003 play ''[[Einstein's Gift]]''. Thiessen describes Haber as a tragic figure who strives unsuccessfully throughout his life to evade both his Jewish ancestry and the moral implications of his scientific contributions.<ref name="Saltzman">{{cite news|last1=Saltzman|first1=Simon|title=Broadway Review: 'Einstein's Gift'|url=http://www.princetoninfo.com/index.php/component/us1more/?key=10-19-2005_p_04|access-date=18 April 2017|work=U.S. 1 Newspaper|date=19 October 2005}}</ref>

[[BBC Radio 4]] ''[[Afternoon Play]]'' has broadcast two plays on the life of Fritz Haber. The description of the first reads:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anthonyphillips.co.uk/media/bfta.htm|title=Bread from the Air, Gold from the Sea|publisher=Archives of Anthony Phillips (who composed the music)|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202212534/http://www.anthonyphillips.co.uk/media/bfta.htm|archive-date=2 February 2009}}</ref> from the Diversity Website:

{{quote|Bread from the Air, Gold from the Sea'' as another chemical story (R4, 1415, 16 Feb 01). Fritz Haber found a way of making nitrogen compounds from the air. They have two main uses: fertilizers and explosives. His process enabled Germany to produce vast quantities of armaments. (The second part of the title refers to a process for obtaining gold from sea water. It worked, but didn't pay.) There can be few figures with a more interesting life than Haber, from a biographer's point of view. He made German agriculture independent of Chilean [[Sodium nitrate|saltpetre]] during the Great War. He received the Nobel Prize for Chemistry, yet there were moves to strip him of the award because of his work on gas warfare. He pointed out, rightly, that most of Nobel's money had come from armaments and the pursuit of war. After Hitler's rise to power, the government forced Haber to resign from his professorship and research jobs because he was Jewish.}}

The second play was titled ''The Greater Good'' and was first broadcast on 23 October 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00f06bw|title=Afternoon Play, The Greater Good|publisher=BBC}}</ref> It was directed by Celia de Wolff and written by Justin Hopper, and starred [[Anton Lesser]] as Haber.
