'''Lester Bowles Pearson''' {{post-nominals|country=CAN|PC|OMt|CC|OBE}} (23 April 1897&nbsp;– 27 December 1972) was a Canadian scholar, statesman, soldier, and diplomat who served as the 14th [[prime minister of Canada]] from 1963 to 1968, as the head of two back-to-back [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] [[Minority governments in Canada|minority governments]] after his party won the elections of [[1963 Canadian federal election|1963]] and [[1965 Canadian federal election|1965]].

Born in [[Newtonbrook]], [[Ontario]] (now part of [[Toronto]]), Pearson pursued a career in the [[Global Affairs Canada|Department of External Affairs]]. From 1948 to 1957, he served as [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Canada)|Secretary of State for External Affairs]] under Prime Ministers [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] and [[Louis St. Laurent]]. He narrowly lost the bid to become [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] in [[1953 United Nations Secretary-General selection|1953]]. However, he won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1957 for organizing the [[United Nations Emergency Force]] to resolve the [[Suez Canal Crisis]], which earned him praise and attention worldwide. After the Liberals' defeat in the [[1957 Canadian federal election|1957 federal election]], Pearson easily won the [[1958 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election|leadership of the Liberal Party in 1958]]. Pearson suffered two consecutive defeats by incumbent [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] Prime Minister [[John Diefenbaker]] in [[1958 Canadian federal election|1958]] and [[1962 Canadian federal election|1962]], only to successfully challenge him for a third time in the 1963 federal election.

During Pearson's tenure as prime minister, his government launched progressive policies such as [[Medicare (Canada)|universal health care]] (with help from [[Tommy Douglas]]' [[New Democratic Party|New Democrats]]), the [[Canada Student Loan Program]], and the [[Canada Pension Plan]]. He also introduced the [[Order of Canada]] and the [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]]. Pearson oversaw [[Great Canadian flag debate|the creation]] of the [[Flag of Canada|Maple Leaf flag]] that was implemented in 1965. His government unified [[Canadian Armed Forces|Canada's armed forces]] and kept [[Canada and the Vietnam War|Canada out of the Vietnam War]]. In 1967, Canada became the first country in the world to implement a [[Points-based immigration system#Canada|points-based immigration system]]. After nearly half a decade in power, Pearson resigned as Prime Minister and retired from politics.

With his government programs and policies, together with his groundbreaking work at the United Nations and in international diplomacy, which included his role in ending the Suez Crisis, Pearson is generally considered among the most influential Canadians of the 20th century and is [[Historical rankings of Canadian prime ministers|ranked]] among the greatest Canadian prime ministers.<ref name="irpp.org">MacDonald, L.

==Early life, family, and education==
[[File:Birthplace of Lester B. Pearson plaque (photo by Djuradj Vujcic).jpg|thumb|left|195px|A memorial plaque on the location of his birthplace]]
Pearson was born in [[Newtonbrook]] (now a part of [[Toronto]]) in the township of [[York, Toronto|York]], Ontario, the son of Annie Sarah (née Bowles) and Edwin Arthur Pearson, a [[Methodism|Methodist]] (later [[United Church of Canada]]) minister. Lester was the brother of Vaughan Whitier Pearson and Marmaduke (Duke) Pearson.<ref name="DictCdnBio">{{cite web|url= http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?BioId=42123 |title= Pearson, Lester Bowles|work= [[Dictionary of Canadian Biography]] Online, 2019 –2018 (Volume XX)|publisher= [[University of Toronto]]/[[Université Laval]]|year= 2000|access-date= 13 June 2011}}</ref> When Pearson was one month old, his family moved to 1984 Yonge Street.
Lester Pearson's father moved the young family north of Toronto to [[Aurora, Ontario]], where he was the minister at Aurora Methodist Church on [[Yonge Street]]. Lester spent his early years in Aurora and attended the public school on Church Street. The family lived at 39 Catherine Avenue. Pearson was a member of the Aurora Rugby team.

Pearson graduated from Hamilton Collegiate Institute in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], in 1913 at the age of 16. Later that same year, he entered [[Victoria University in the University of Toronto|Victoria College]] at the [[University of Toronto]],<ref name="DictCdnBio" /> where he lived in residence in Gate House and shared a room with his brother Duke. He was later elected to the [[Pi Gamma Mu]] [[social science]]s honour society's chapter at the University of Toronto for his outstanding scholastic performance in history and psychology. Just as [[Norman Jewison]], [[E. J. Pratt]], [[Northrop Frye]] and his student [[Margaret Atwood]] would, Pearson participated in the sophomore theatrical tradition of ''The Bob Comedy Revue''.<ref>[http://www.thenewspaper.ca/the-arts/despite-cuts-and-critics-bob-carries O'Grady, Conner] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616103915/http://www.thenewspaper.ca/the-arts/despite-cuts-and-critics-bob-carries |date=16 June 2018 }} "Despite cuts and critics, Bob carries on"; ''the newspaper''; University of Toronto; 18 December 2013.</ref> After Victoria College, Pearson won a scholarship to study at [[St John's College, Oxford]], from 1921 to 1923.

===Sporting interests===
At the University of Toronto, Pearson became a noted athlete, excelling in [[rugby union]] and also playing [[basketball]]. He later also played for the [[Oxford University Ice Hockey Club]] while on a scholarship at the [[University of Oxford]], a team that won the first [[Spengler Cup]] in 1923. Pearson also excelled in [[baseball]] and [[lacrosse]] as a youth. His baseball talents as an [[infielder]] were strong enough for a summer of semi-pro play with the [[Guelph Maple Leafs]] of the Ontario [[Intercounty Baseball League]]. Pearson toured North America with a combined Oxford and Cambridge Universities lacrosse team in 1923. After he joined the University of Toronto History Department as an instructor, he helped to coach the U of T's football and hockey teams. He played [[golf]] and [[tennis]] to high standards as an adult.<ref name="LifeofLP">English (1989–1992), Volume I</ref>

==First World War==
[[File:Pearson in World War One.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Pearson serving with the Canadian Army Medical Corps in World War I in [[Thessaloniki|Salonika]]]]

During [[World War I]], Pearson volunteered for service as a medical orderly with the University of Toronto Hospital Unit. In 1915, he entered overseas service with the [[Canadian Army Medical Corps]] as a stretcher-bearer with the rank of [[Private (rank)|private]], and was subsequently promoted to [[corporal]]. During this period of service, he spent nearly two years in Southern Europe, being shipped to [[Egypt]] and thereafter served on the [[Salonika Front]]. He also served alongside the [[Serbian Campaign of World War I|Serbian Army]] as a medical orderly.<ref name="The Oldest Filling in the World">{{cite web |url=http://www.politika.rs/scc/clanak/62701/%D0%9D%D0%B0%D1%98%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0-%D0%BF%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%BC%D0%B1%D0%B0-%D0%BD%D0%B0-%D1%81%D0%B2%D0%B5%D1%82%D1%83 |author=Politika |title=Najstarija plomba na svetu |access-date=1 July 2012 |date=15 November 2008 |language=sr|author-link=Politika }}</ref> On 2 August 1917, Pearson was commissioned a temporary lieutenant.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=30237|supp=y|page=8512|date=17 August 1917}}</ref> The [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] did not exist at that time, so Pearson transferred to Britain's [[Royal Flying Corps]], where he served as a [[flying officer]]. It was as a pilot that he received the nickname of "Mike", given to him by a flight instructor who felt that "Lester" was too mild a name for an airman: "That’s a sissy’s name. You’re Mike," the instructor said.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://parli.ca/mike-pearson/?_thumbnail_id=1565 |title= 'Mike' Pearson|work= The Dictionary of Canadian Politics|publisher= Parli|year= 2021|access-date= 2 April 2021}}</ref> Thereafter, Pearson would use the name "Lester" on official documents and in public life, but was always addressed as "Mike" by friends and family.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1957/pearson-bio.html |title= Biography|work= The Nobel Peace Prize 1957 – Lester Bowles Pearson|publisher= [[Nobel Foundation]]|year= 1957|access-date= 13 October 2008}}</ref>

Pearson learned to fly at an air training school in [[Hendon]], England. He survived an airplane crash during his first flight.<ref>[https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/lester-bowles-pearson Lester B. Pearson] at [[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]</ref><ref>[https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/military-heritage/first-world-war/100-stories/Pages/pearson.aspx Lester Bowles Pearson] at [[Library and Archives Canada]]</ref><ref>[https://www.bac-lac.gc.ca/eng/discover/military-heritage/first-world-war/canada-first-world-war/Pages/pearson.aspx Lester Bowles Pearson (1897–1972)], Canada and the First World War at [[Library and Archives Canada]]</ref> In 1918, Pearson was hit by a bus in London during a citywide [[blackout (wartime)|blackout]] and he was sent home to recuperate, but then he was discharged from the service.

==Immediate post-war years==
After the war, he returned to school, receiving his [[Bachelor of Arts degree]] from the [[University of Toronto]] in 1919. He was able to complete his degree after one more term, under a ruling in force at the time, since he had served in the military during the war. He then spent a year working in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], and in Chicago, in the meat-packing industry, which he did not enjoy.

===Oxford===
Upon receiving a scholarship from the [[Massey Foundation]], he studied for two years at [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]] at the [[University of Oxford]], where he received a B.A. degree with Second-Class honours in modern history in 1923, and the [[Degrees of Oxford University|M.A.]] in 1925. After Oxford, he returned to Canada and taught history at the University of Toronto.

==Marriage, family==
In 1925, he married [[Maryon Moody]], from Winnipeg, who had been one of his students at the University of Toronto. Together, they had one son, [[Geoffrey Pearson|Geoffrey]], and one daughter, Patricia.<ref name="LifeofLP" /> Although Maryon was initially a highly critical woman with an occasionally short temper during the first two decades of marriage, she supported her husband in all his political endeavors.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zN79XJJaIhUC&q=mary+greey+canada&pg=PT288|title=The Worldly Years: Life of Lester Pearson 1949–1972|last=English|first=John|date=14 September 2011|publisher=Knopf Canada|isbn=9780307375391|language=en}}</ref>

==Diplomat, public servant==

[[File:Ice hockey 1922.jpg|thumb|Ice hockey in Europe; Oxford University vs. [[Switzerland]], 1922. Future Canadian Prime Minister Lester Pearson is at right front. His nickname from the Swiss was "Herr Zig-Zag".]]
In 1927, after scoring the top marks on the Canadian foreign service entry exam, he then embarked on a career in the [[Foreign Affairs Canada|Department of External Affairs]].<ref name="LifeofLP" /> Prime Minister [[R. B. Bennett]] was a noted talent spotter. He took note of, and encouraged, the young Lester Pearson in the early 1930s, and appointed Pearson to significant roles on two major government inquiries: the 1931 Royal Commission on Grain Futures, and the 1934 Royal Commission on Price Spreads. Bennett saw that Pearson was recognized with an [[OBE]] after he shone in that work, arranged a bonus of $1,800, and invited him to a London conference. Pearson was assigned to the [[High Commission of Canada to the United Kingdom]] in 1935, and he served there during [[World War II]] from 1939 through 1942 as the second-in-command at Canada House, where he coordinated military supply and refugee problems, serving under High Commissioner [[Vincent Massey]].<ref name="LifeofLP" />

Pearson returned to [[Ottawa]] for a few months, where he was an assistant under secretary from 1941 through 1942.<ref name="EncyclopediaCanadiana">EncyclopediaCanadiana (1972)</ref> In June 1942 he was posted to the Canadian Embassy in Washington, D.C., as a ministerial counsellor.<ref name="EncyclopediaCanadiana" /> He served as second-in-command for nearly two years. Promoted minister [[plenipotentiary]] in 1944, he became the second [[Canadian Ambassador to the United States]] on 1 January 1945. He remained in this position through September 1946.<ref name="LifeofLP" /><ref name="EncyclopediaCanadiana" />

Pearson had an important part in founding both the United Nations and the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]].<ref>EncyclopediaCanadiana (1972). "He attended many international conferences and was active in the U.N. from its inception." and "He signed the North Atlantic Treaty for Canada in 1949 and represented his country at subsequent NATO Council meetings, acting as the chairman in 1951–52."</ref>

Pearson nearly became the first [[Secretary-General of the United Nations]] in 1946, but he was vetoed by the [[Soviet Union]].<ref name="LifeofLP" /> He was also the leading candidate for Secretary-General in the [[United Nations Secretary-General selection, 1953|1953 selection]], when the British conducted a vigorous campaign on his behalf. He placed first with 10 out of 11 votes in the Security Council, but the lone negative vote was another Soviet veto.<ref name="nytimes19530313">{{cite news | last1=Hamilton | first1=Thomas J. | title=Soviet Veto Blocks Pearson U.N.

The Canadian Prime Minister, [[Mackenzie King]], tried to recruit Pearson into his government as the war wound down. Pearson felt honoured by King's approach, but he resisted at the time, due to his personal dislike of King's poor personal style and political methods.<ref>Hutchison (1964)</ref> Pearson did not make the move into politics until a few years later, after King had announced his retirement as the Prime Minister of Canada.

==Early political career==

In 1948, before his retirement, Prime Minister King appointed Pearson [[Secretary of State for External Affairs (Canada)|secretary of state for external affairs]] (foreign minister) in the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]] government. Shortly afterward, Pearson won a seat in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]], for the federal riding of [[Algoma East]] in [[Northern Ontario]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lop.parl.ca/About/Parliament/FederalRidingsHistory/hfer.asp?Language=E&Search=Det&Include=Y&rid=10|title=History of Federal Ridings since 1867|website=lop.parl.ca}}</ref> Pearson then served as Secretary of State for External Affairs for Prime Minister [[Louis St. Laurent]], until the defeat of the St. Laurent government in 1957.

==Nobel Peace Prize==
[[File:LPB quote on Peacekeeping Monument.jpg|thumb|left|Lester B. Pearson quote on the [[Peacekeeping Monument]]]]
In 1957, for his role in resolving the [[Suez Crisis]] through the United Nations, Pearson was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/peace/1957/pearson/facts/|title=Nobel peace Prize 1957 Lester Bowles Pearson|website=Norwegian Nobel Institute}}</ref> The selection committee argued that Pearson had "saved the world", but critics accused him of betraying the motherland and Canada's ties with the UK. Pearson and UN Secretary-General [[Dag Hammarskjöld]] are considered the fathers of the modern concept of [[peacekeeping]]. Together, they were able to organize the [[United Nations Emergency Force]] by way of a five-day fly-around in early November 1956. His Nobel medal was on permanent display in the front lobby of the Lester B. Pearson Building, the headquarters of [[Global Affairs Canada]] in Ottawa. Until, in 2017, the medal was loaned to the [[Canadian Museum of History]], to be displayed in the 'Canadian History Hall'.<ref>{{cite news |last1=History |first1=Canadian Museum of |title=Pearson's Nobel Peace Prize loaned to Canadian Museum of History |url=https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/pearsons-nobel-peace-prize-loaned-to-canadian-museum-of-history-603031446.html |access-date=16 June 2021 |work=www.newswire.ca |date=25 November 2016 |language=en}}</ref>

==Party leadership==
[[File:Lester Bowles Pearson presiding at a plenary session of the founding conference of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.jpg|left|thumb|Pearson presiding at a plenary session of the founding conference of the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] in 1945.]]
St. Laurent was defeated by the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]] under [[John Diefenbaker]] in the [[1957 Canadian federal election|election of 1957]]. After just a few months as [[Leader of the Opposition (Canada)|Leader of the Opposition]], St. Laurent retired, and he endorsed Pearson as his successor. Pearson was elected leader of the Liberal Party at its [[1958 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election|leadership convention of 1958]], defeating his chief rival, former cabinet minister [[Paul Martin Sr.]]

At his first parliamentary session as opposition leader, Pearson asked Diefenbaker to give power back to the Liberals without an election, because of a recent economic downturn. This strategy backfired when Diefenbaker showed a classified Liberal document saying that the economy would face a downturn in that year. This contrasted heavily with the Liberals' campaign promises of 1957.

Consequently, Pearson's party was routed in the [[1958 Canadian federal election|federal election of 1958]]. The Liberals lost more than half their seats, while Diefenbaker's Conservatives won the largest majority ever seen in Canada to that point (208 of 265 seats). Furthermore, the election cost the Liberals their stronghold in [[Quebec]]. This province had voted largely Liberal in federal elections since the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]], but Quebec had no [[favourite son]] leader, as it had had since 1948.

Pearson convened a significant "Thinkers' Conference" at [[Kingston, Ontario]] in 1960. This event developed many of the ideas later implemented when he became the Prime Minister.<ref>{{Cite book|last= English|first= John|author-link= John English (Canadian politician)|title= Citizen of the World: The Life of Pierre Elliott Trudeau|volume= Vol. I, 1919–1968|year= 2006|location= Toronto|publisher= [[Random House of Canada|Alfred A. Knopf Canada]]|isbn= 978-0-676-97521-5|oclc= 670444001}}</ref>

In the [[1962 Canadian federal election|federal election of 1962]], the Liberals, led by Pearson, and the surprise election of 30 [[Social Credit]] MP's, deprived the Tories of their majority. As a consequence, Diefenbaker now had to preside over a [[minority governments in Canada|minority government]].

Not long after the election, Pearson capitalized on the Conservatives' indecision on accepting American [[nuclear warhead]]s on Canadian [[BOMARC missile]]s. Defence Minister [[Douglas Harkness]] resigned from Cabinet on 4 February 1963, because of Diefenbaker's opposition to accepting the warheads. On the next day, the government lost two nonconfidence motions on the issue, [[1963 Canadian federal election|forcing a national election]]. In that election, the Liberals took 129 seats to the Tories' 95. Despite winning 41 percent of the vote, the Liberals came up five seats short of a majority largely because of winning just three seats on the Prairies. With the support of six Social Credit MPs from Quebec,<ref>{{cite news|title=Pearson Offered Majority|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&dat=19630413&id=ks5RAAAAIBAJ&pg=7097,2070462|agency=Pittsburgh Post Gazette|date=13 April 1963}}</ref> Pearson was able to guarantee stable government to the Governor-General, and Diefenbaker resigned, allowing Pearson to form a [[minority governments in Canada|minority government]]. He was sworn in as the Prime Minister on 22 April 1963. Even though the support the Social Credit MPs was soon withdrawn, Pearson was able to maintain government with the support of the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]].

===Domestic policy and events===
Pearson campaigned during the 1963 election promising "60 Days of Decision" and supported the [[Bomarc]] [[surface-to-air missile]] program. Pearson never had a majority in the [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]], but he brought in many of Canada's major updated social programs, including [[Medicare (Canada)|universal health care]] (though that credit should be shared with [[Tommy Douglas]]), the [[Canada Pension Plan]], and [[Canada Student Loans]]. Pearson instituted a new national flag, the [[Flag of Canada|Maple Leaf flag]], after a national debate known as the [[Great Canadian flag debate]]. He also instituted the 40-hour work week, two weeks vacation time, and a new [[minimum wage]] for workers in federally-regulated areas.

====Women's rights and bilingualism====
Pearson also started a number of [[royal commission]]s, including the [[Royal Commission on the Status of Women]] and the [[Royal Commission on Bilingualism and Biculturalism]]. These suggested changes that helped create legal equality for women and brought official [[bilingualism in Canada|bilingualism]] into being. After Pearson's term in office, French was made an [[official language]], and the Canadian government provided services in both English and French. Pearson himself had hoped that he would be the last unilingual Prime Minister of Canada and fluency in both English and French became an unofficial requirement for candidates for Prime Minister after Pearson left office.

====Immigration====

In 1967, Pearson's government introduced a discrimination-free [[Points-based immigration system|points-based system]] which encouraged immigration to Canada, making it the first country in the world to do so.

====Canadian Centennial====

Pearson oversaw [[Canadian Centennial|Canada's centennial celebrations]] in 1967 before retiring. The Canadian news agency, [[The Canadian Press]], named him "[[Canadian Newsmaker of the Year|Newsmaker of the Year]]" that year, citing his leadership during the centennial celebrations, which brought the [[Centennial Flame]] to [[Parliament Hill]].

===Foreign policy===

====France====

On 15 January 1964, Pearson became the first Canadian Prime Minister to make an official [[state visit]] to France.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/politics/international-politics/general-23/first-state-visit-to-france-by-a-canadian-pm.html |title= On This Day – Jan. 15, 1964 – First state visit to France by a Canadian PM|work= CBC Digital Archives|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|access-date=14 January 2011}}</ref> 

In 1967, French president [[Charles de Gaulle]] made a visit to [[Quebec]]. During that visit, de Gaulle was a staunch advocate of Quebec separatism, even going so far as to say that his procession in [[Montreal]] reminded him of his return to Paris after it was freed from the [[Nazism|Nazis]] during the Second World War. President de Gaulle also gave his [[Vive le Québec libre speech|"Vive le Québec libre" speech]] during the visit. Given Canada's efforts in aiding France during both world wars, Pearson was enraged. He rebuked de Gaulle in a speech the following day, remarking that "Canadians do not need to be liberated" and made it clear that de Gaulle was no longer welcome in Canada.

====United States====

Pearson signed the [[Canada–United States Automotive Products Agreement|Canada–United States Automotive Agreement]] (or Auto Pact) in January 1965, and unemployment fell to its lowest rate in over a decade.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cbc.ca/archives/categories/economy-business/trade-agreements/the-auto-pact-en-route-to-free-trade/the-end-of-an-era.html |title= The Auto Pact: En Route to Free Trade|work= CBC Digital Archives|publisher= Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|access-date= 29 August 2011}}</ref> 

While in office, Pearson declined U.S. requests to send Canadian combat troops into the [[Vietnam War]]. Pearson spoke at [[Temple University]] in [[Philadelphia]] on 2 April 1965 and voiced his support for a pause in the American bombing of North Vietnam, so that a diplomatic solution to the crisis may unfold. To President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], this criticism of American foreign policy on American soil was an intolerable sin. Before Pearson had finished his speech, he was summoned to [[Camp David, Maryland]], to meet with Johnson the next day. Johnson, who was notorious for his personal touch in politics, reportedly grabbed Pearson by the lapels and shouted, "You pissed on my rug."<ref>{{cite magazine|url= http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-2286782/The-Week.html |title= The Week|magazine= [[National Review]]|date= 23 December 2002|access-date= 4 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A43737-2004Aug5.html |last= FitzGerald|first= Frances|title= The View From Out There|newspaper= [[The Washington Post]]|date= 8 August 2004|access-date= 29 August 2011}} A book review of {{cite book|last1= Lindaman|first1= Dana|last2= Ward|first2= Kyle Roy|title= History lessons : how textbooks from around the world portray U.S. history|year= 2004|location= New York City|publisher= [[The New Press]]|isbn= 978-1-56584-894-8|oclc= 54096924}}</ref> Text of his Philadelphia speech, however, showed that Pearson in fact supported President Johnson's policy in Vietnam, even stating "The government and great majority of people of my country have supported wholeheartedly the US peacekeeping and peacemaking policies in Vietnam."<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J3_FBQAAQBAJ&q=The+government+and+great+majority+of+people+of+my+country+have+supported+wholeheartedly+the+US+peacekeeping+and+peacemaking+policies+in+Vietnam+lester+pearson&pg=PT86|title=The Globalization of NATO: Intervention, Security and Identity|first=Veronica M.|last=Kitchen|access-date=5 October 2019|isbn=9781136955679|date=13 April 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://yvesengler.com/2016/03/15/why-does-mainstream-keep-repeating-lies-about-lester-pearson/ |title = Why does mainstream media keep repeating lies about Lester Pearson?|date = 15 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9g4Xd12rIGYC&q=Linda+McQuaig++contributed+to+ending+the+U.S.+war+effort+in+Vietnam.&pg=PT88|title=Holding the Bully's Coat: Canada and the U.S. Empire|first=Linda|last=McQuaig|date=4 June 2010|isbn=9780385672979|access-date=5 October 2019}}</ref>

Pearson later recounted that the meeting was acrimonious, but insisted the two parted cordially. After this incident, LBJ and Pearson did have further contacts, including two more meetings together, both times in Canada<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/holdings/Findingaids/WHCF/COLIST.asp|title= Presidential visits with heads of state and chiefs of government|publisher= [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum]]|access-date= 29 August 2011|archive-url= http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20011116110318/http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/holdings/findingaids/whcf/colist.asp|archive-date= 16 November 2001|url-status= dead|df= dmy-all}}</ref> as the United States relied on Canada's raw materials and resources to fuel and sustain its efforts in the Vietnam War.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last= Daume|editor1-first= Daphne|editor2-last= Watson|editor2-first= Louise|title= Britannica Book of the Year 1967|year= 1967|location= Chicago|publisher= [[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]]|page= 191|quote= Strong exports to the United States resulting from the mounting demands of the war in [[Vietnam]], combined with a booming domestic market, made 1966 a year of impressive economic growth for Canada.|oclc= 42780089}} Also {{OCLC|19056858}}.</ref>

===Military===
Pearson's government endured significant controversy in Canada's military services throughout the mid-1960s, following the tabling of the [[White Paper on Defence]] in March 1964. This document laid out a plan to merge the [[Royal Canadian Navy]], the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]], and the [[Canadian Army]] to form a single service called the [[Canadian Forces]]. Military unification took effect on 1 February 1968, when ''The Canadian Forces Reorganization Act'' received Royal Assent.

===Retirement===

After his 14 December 1967 announcement that he was retiring from politics, [[1968 Liberal Party of Canada leadership election|a leadership convention]] was held. Pearson's successor was [[Pierre Trudeau]], whom Pearson had recruited and made [[Minister of Justice (Canada)|justice minister]] in his [[Cabinet of Canada|cabinet]]. Two other cabinet ministers Pearson had recruited, [[John Turner]] and [[Jean Chrétien]], served as prime ministers following Trudeau's retirement.

==Supreme Court appointments==
Pearson chose the following jurists to be appointed as justices of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] by the [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]]:
* [[Robert Taschereau]] (as Chief Justice, 22 April 1963 – 1 September 1967; appointed a [[Puisne Justice]] under Prime Minister King, 9 February 1940)
* [[Wishart Flett Spence]] (30 May 1963 – 29 December 1978)
* [[John Robert Cartwright]] (as Chief Justice, 1 September 1967 – 23 March 1970; appointed a Puisne Justice under Prime Minister [[Louis St. Laurent|St. Laurent]], 22 December 1949)
* [[Louis-Philippe Pigeon]] (21 September 1967 – 8 February 1980)

==After politics==
[[File:Lester B Pearson Gravestone WakefieldQC.JPG|thumb|right|Pearson's gravestone in [[Wakefield, Quebec]]]]
From 1968 to 1969, Pearson served as chairman of the Commission on International Development (the Pearson Commission), which was sponsored by the [[World Bank]]. Immediately following his retirement, he lectured in history and political science at [[Carleton University]] in Ottawa while writing his memoirs. From 1970 to 1972, he was the first chairman of the Board of Governors of the [[International Development Research Centre]]. From 1969 until his death in 1972, he was chancellor of Carleton University.

==Illness and death==
In 1970, Pearson underwent a surgery to have his right eye removed to remove a tumor in that area.<ref name="tumour">{{cite news |url=http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/series/primeministers/stories/cancer-LBP.html |title=Pearson hovers near death as cancer spreads to his liver |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=28 December 1972 |access-date=17 September 2014 |archive-date=14 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120814161820/http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/series/primeministers/stories/cancer-LBP.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Pearson had planned at the time to write a three-volume set of memoirs, and had published Volume One by 1972. He had finished but a few chapters of Volume Two when, in November 1972, it was reported that he was admitted to the hospital for further unspecified treatment, but the prognosis was poor. He tried to write at this juncture the story of his prime ministerial career, but his condition, which was already precarious, deteriorated rapidly by Christmas Eve.<ref>{{harvnb|Pearson|Munro|Inglis|1973|p=i}}</ref>

On 27 December 1972, it was announced that the cancer had spread to the liver and Pearson had lapsed into a coma. He died at 11:40&nbsp;pm [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]] on 27 December 1972 in his Ottawa home.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://v1.theglobeandmail.com/series/primeministers/stories/obit-LBP.html |title=Lester Pearson dies in Ottawa |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |date=28 December 1972 |access-date=17 September 2014 }}</ref>
