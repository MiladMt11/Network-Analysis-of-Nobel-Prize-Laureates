==Education and early life==
Brockhouse was born in [[Lethbridge]], [[Alberta]], and was a graduate of the [[University of British Columbia]] ([[Bachelor of Arts|BA]], 1947) and the [[University of Toronto]] ([[Master of Arts|MA]], 1948; [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D]], 1950).<ref name=bertphd>{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Bertram Neville|last=Brockhouse |title=The effect of stress and temperature upon the magnetic properties of ferromagnetic materials |publisher=[[University of Toronto]] |date=1950 |oclc=222041304}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://neutron.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/brock_e.html |title=Brockhouse and the Nobel Prize - Canadian Neutron Beam Centre |publisher=neutron.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca |access-date=2008-06-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217043548/http://neutron.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/brock_e.html |archive-date=2009-02-17 }}</ref>

==Career and research==
From 1950 to 1962, Brockhouse carried out research at [[Atomic Energy of Canada]]'s [[Chalk River Nuclear Laboratory]]. Here he was joined by [[P. K. Iyengar]], who is treated as the father of India's nuclear program.

In 1962, he became professor at [[McMaster University]] in Canada, where he remained until his retirement in 1984.

==Awards and honours==
Brockhouse was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1965|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1965]].<ref name=frs/> In 1982, Brockhouse was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]] and was promoted to Companion in 1995.

Brockhouse shared the 1994 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] with American [[Clifford Shull]] of MIT<ref name='MIT'>{{cite web |url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2001/shull.html |title=Clifford G. Shull, co-winner of 1994 Nobel Prize in physics, is dead at 85 |access-date=2010-12-27 |date=2001-04-02 |work=MIT-News |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vIW7AcRb?url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2001/shull.html |archive-date=2010-12-27 |quote=Professor Shull shared the 1994 Nobel Prize with Professor Bertram S. Brockhouse of McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. |url-status=dead }}</ref> for developing [[neutron scattering]] techniques for studying condensed matter.

In October 2005, as part of the 75th anniversary of McMaster University's establishment in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], a street on the University campus (University Avenue) was renamed to Brockhouse Way in honour of Brockhouse. The town of [[Deep River, Ontario]] has also named a street in his honour.

The Nobel Prize that Bertram Brockhouse won (shared with Clifford Shull) in 1994 was awarded after the longest ever waiting time (counting from the time when the award-winning research had been carried out).

In 1999 the Division of Condensed Matter and Materials Physics (DCMMP) and the [[Canadian Association of Physicists]] (CAP) created a medal in honour of Brockhouse.  The medal is called the Brockhouse Medal and is awarded to recognize and encourage outstanding experimental or theoretical contributions to condensed matter and materials physics. This medal is awarded annually on the basis of outstanding experimental or theoretical contributions to condensed matter physics. An eligible candidate must have performed their research primarily with a Canadian Institution.
