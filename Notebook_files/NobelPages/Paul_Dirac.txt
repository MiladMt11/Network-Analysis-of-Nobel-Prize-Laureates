Dirac made fundamental contributions to the early development of both [[quantum mechanics]] and [[quantum electrodynamics]]. Among other discoveries, he formulated the [[Dirac equation]] which describes the behaviour of [[fermion]]s and predicted the existence of [[antimatter]]. Dirac shared the 1933 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] with [[Erwin Schrödinger]] "for the discovery of new productive forms of [[atomic theory]]".<ref name="nobel">{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1933/ |title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1933 |publisher=The Nobel Foundation |access-date=4 April 2013}}</ref> He also made significant contributions to the reconciliation of [[general relativity]] with quantum mechanics.

Dirac was regarded by his friends and colleagues as unusual in character. In a 1926 letter to [[Paul Ehrenfest]], [[Albert Einstein]] wrote of Dirac, "I have trouble with Dirac. This balancing on the dizzying path between genius and madness is awful." In another letter concerning the [[Compton scattering|Compton effect]] he wrote, "I don't understand Dirac at all."<ref>{{harvnb|Kragh|1990|p=82]}}</ref>

He was the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], was a member of the [[Center for Theoretical Studies, University of Miami]], and spent the last decade of his life at [[Florida State University]].

==Personal life==

===Early years===
Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac was born at his parents' home in [[Bristol]], England, on 8 August 1902,<ref>{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-TT_z4llWoIC&lpg=PP1&hl=de&pg=PA10 10]}}</ref> and grew up in the [[Bishopston, Bristol|Bishopston]] area of the city.<ref>{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-TT_z4llWoIC&lpg=PP1&hl=de&pg=PA18 18–19]}}</ref> His father, Charles Adrien Ladislas Dirac, was an immigrant from [[Saint-Maurice, Switzerland]], who worked in Bristol as a French teacher. His mother, Florence Hannah Dirac, née Holten, the daughter of a ship's captain, was born in [[Cornwall]], England, and worked as a librarian at the [[Bristol Central Library]]. Paul had a younger sister, Béatrice Isabelle Marguerite, known as Betty, and an older brother, Reginald Charles Félix, known as Felix,<ref>{{harvnb|Kragh|1990|p=1}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|pp=10–11}}</ref> who died by suicide in March 1925.<ref>{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-TT_z4llWoIC&lpg=PP1&hl=de&pg=PA77 77–78]}}</ref> Dirac later recalled: "My parents were terribly distressed. I didn't know they cared so much ... I never knew that parents were supposed to care for their children, but from then on I knew."<ref>{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-TT_z4llWoIC&lpg=PP1&hl=de&pg=PA79 79]}}</ref>

Charles and the children were officially Swiss nationals until they became [[naturalised]] on 22 October 1919.<ref>{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|p=34}}</ref> Dirac's father was strict and authoritarian, although he disapproved of corporal punishment.<ref>{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|p=22}}</ref> Dirac had a strained relationship with his father, so much so that after his father's death, Dirac wrote, "I feel much freer now, and I am my own man." Charles forced his children to speak to him only in French so that they might learn the language. When Dirac found that he could not express what he wanted to say in French, he chose to remain silent.<ref>{{harvnb|Mehra|1972|p=17}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Kragh|1990|p=2}}</ref>

===Education===
Dirac was educated first at [[Bishop Road Primary School]]<ref>{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|pp=13–17}}</ref> and then at the all-boys [[Society of Merchant Venturers|Merchant Venturers']] Technical College (later [[Cotham School]]), where his father was a French teacher.<ref>{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|pp=20–21}}</ref> The school was an institution attached to the [[University of Bristol]], which shared grounds and staff.<ref name="Mehra18"/> It emphasised technical subjects like bricklaying, shoemaking and metal work, and modern languages.<ref>{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|p=23}}</ref> This was unusual at a time when secondary education in Britain was still dedicated largely to the classics, and something for which Dirac would later express his gratitude.<ref name="Mehra18">{{harvnb|Mehra|1972|p=18}}</ref>

Dirac studied [[electrical engineering]] on a City of Bristol University Scholarship at the University of Bristol's engineering faculty, which was co-located with the Merchant Venturers' Technical College.<ref>{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|p=28}}</ref> Shortly before he completed his degree in 1921, he sat for the entrance examination for [[St John's College, Cambridge]]. He passed and was awarded a £70 scholarship, but this fell short of the amount of money required to live and study at Cambridge. Despite his having graduated with a [[first class honours]] Bachelor of Science degree in engineering, the economic climate of the [[Post–World War I recession|post-war depression]] was such that he was unable to find work as an engineer. Instead, he took up an offer to study for a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in mathematics at the University of Bristol free of charge. He was permitted to skip the first year of the course owing to his engineering degree.<ref>{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|pp=46–47}}</ref>

In 1923, Dirac graduated, once again with first class honours, and received a £140 scholarship from the [[Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (United Kingdom)|Department of Scientific and Industrial Research]].<ref>{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|p=53}}</ref> Along with his £70 scholarship from St John's College, this was enough to live at Cambridge. There, Dirac pursued his interests in the theory of [[general relativity]], an interest he had gained earlier as a student in Bristol, and in the nascent field of [[quantum physics]], under the supervision of [[Ralph Fowler]].<ref>{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|pp=52–53}}</ref> From 1925 to 1928 he held an [[1851 Research Fellowship]] from the [[Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851]].<ref name="1851 Royal Commission Archives">1851 Royal Commission Archives</ref> He completed his PhD in June 1926 with the first thesis on quantum mechanics to be submitted anywhere.<ref>{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|p=101}}</ref> He then continued his research in [[Copenhagen]] and [[Göttingen]].<ref name="1851 Royal Commission Archives"/> In the spring of 1929, he was a visiting professor at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]].<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Kursunoglu |editor1-first=Behram N. |editor2-last=Wigner |editor2-first=Eugene Paul |title=Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac: Reminiscences about a Great Physicist |date=1990 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521386888 |page=132 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1Pg7t9a_AX4C&q=paul+dirac+university+of+wisconsin+1929&pg=PA132 |access-date=30 September 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac |url=https://pages.hep.wisc.edu/~ldurand/715html/courseinfo/biographies/dirac.html |publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison |access-date=30 September 2020}}</ref>

===Family===
[[File:Dirac,Paul 1963 Kopenhagen.jpg|thumb|Paul Dirac with his wife in [[Copenhagen]], July 1963]]
In 1937, Dirac married Margit Wigner ([[Eugene Wigner]]'s sister). He adopted Margit's two children, Judith and [[Gabriel Andrew Dirac|Gabriel]]. Paul and Margit Dirac had two children together, both daughters, Mary Elizabeth and Florence Monica.

Margit, known as Manci, visited her brother in 1934 in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], from their native Hungary and, while at dinner at the Annex Restaurant, met the "lonely-looking man at the next table". This account from a Korean physicist, Y. S. Kim, who met and was influenced by Dirac, also says: "It is quite fortunate for the physics community that Manci took good care of our respected Paul A. M. Dirac. Dirac published eleven papers during the period 1939–46... Dirac was able to maintain his normal research productivity only because Manci was in charge of everything else".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ysfine.com/dirac/wigsis.html |title=Wigner's Sisters |last=Kim |first=Young Suh |year=1995 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080303112257/https://ysfine.com/dirac/wigsis.html |archive-date= 3 March 2008}}</ref>

===Personality===
Dirac was known among his colleagues for his precise and taciturn nature. His colleagues in Cambridge jokingly defined a unit called a "dirac", which was one word per hour.<ref>{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|p=89}}</ref> When [[Niels Bohr]] complained that he did not know how to finish a sentence in a scientific article he was writing, Dirac replied, "I was taught at school never to start a sentence without knowing the end of it."<ref name="standy">{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Printonly/Dirac.html |title=Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac |publisher=University of St. Andrews |access-date=4 April 2013}}</ref> He criticised the physicist [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]'s interest in poetry: "The aim of science is to make difficult things understandable in a simpler way; the aim of poetry is to state simple things in an incomprehensible way. The two are incompatible."<ref>{{harvnb|Mehra|1972|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=CpJiqUFkHGoC&pg=PA17 17–59]}}</ref>

Dirac himself wrote in his diary during his postgraduate years that he concentrated solely on his research, and stopped only on Sunday when he took long strolls alone.<ref>{{harvnb|Kragh|1990|p=17}}</ref>

An anecdote recounted in a review of the 2009 biography tells of [[Werner Heisenberg]] and Dirac sailing on an ocean liner to a conference in Japan in August 1929. "Both still in their twenties, and unmarried, they made an odd couple. Heisenberg was a ladies' man who constantly flirted and danced, while Dirac—'an Edwardian geek', as biographer [[Graham Farmelo]] puts it—suffered agonies if forced into any kind of socializing or small talk. 'Why do you dance?' Dirac asked his companion. 'When there are nice girls, it is a pleasure,' Heisenberg replied. Dirac pondered this notion, then blurted out: 'But, Heisenberg, how do you know beforehand that the girls are nice?{{' "}}<ref name="mckie">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/feb/01/strangest-man-paul-dirac-review |title=Anti-matter and madness |last1=McKie |first1=Rob |date=1 February 2009 |work=The Guardian |access-date=4 April 2013}}</ref>

Margit Dirac told both [[George Gamow]] and [[Anton Capri]] in the 1960s that her husband had said to a house visitor, "Allow me to present Wigner's sister, who is now my wife."<ref>{{harvnb|Gamow|1966|p=121}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Capri|2007|p=148}}</ref>

Another story told of Dirac is that when he first met the young [[Richard Feynman]] at a conference, he said after a long silence, "I have an equation. Do you have one too?"<ref>{{harvnb|Zee|2010|p=105}}</ref>

After he presented a lecture at a conference, one colleague raised his hand and said: "I don't understand the equation on the top-right-hand corner of the blackboard". After a long silence, the moderator asked Dirac if he wanted to answer the question, to which Dirac replied: "That was not a question, it was a comment."<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/books-and-media/review-the-strangest-man-by-graham-farmelo/article4289494/ | title=A quantum leap into oddness | first=Chet | last=Raymo | newspaper=The Globe and Mail | date=17 October 2009}} (Review of Farmelo's ''The Strangest Man''.)</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|pp=161–162}}, who attributes the story to [[Niels Bohr]].</ref>

Dirac was also noted for his personal modesty. He called the equation for the [[time evolution]] of a quantum-mechanical operator, which he was the first to write down, the "Heisenberg equation of motion". Most physicists speak of [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] for half-integer-spin particles and [[Bose–Einstein statistics]] for integer-spin particles. While lecturing later in life, Dirac always insisted on calling the former "Fermi statistics". He referred to the latter as "Bose statistics" for reasons, he explained, of "symmetry".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mehra|first1=Jagdish|last2=Rechenberg|first2=Helmut|author-link1=Jagdish Mehra |author-link2=Helmut Rechenberg |title=The Historical Development of Quantum Theory|year=2001|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9780387951805|page=746|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-pL56OcVubgC&q=Paul+Dirac+Einstein+statistics+Symmetry&pg=PA746}}</ref>

===Views on religion===
Heisenberg recollected a conversation among young participants at the 1927 [[Solvay Conference]] about Einstein and [[Max Planck|Planck]]'s views on religion between [[Wolfgang Pauli]], Heisenberg and Dirac. Dirac's contribution was a criticism of the political purpose of religion, which Bohr regarded as quite lucid when hearing it from Heisenberg later.<ref>[[Abraham Pais|Pais, A.]], ''Niels Bohr's Times: In Physics, Philosophy, and Polity'' (Oxford: [[Oxford University Press#Clarendon Press|Clarendon Press]], 1991), [https://archive.org/details/nielsbohrstimesi0000pais/page/320 p. 320].</ref> Among other things, Dirac said:
<blockquote>I cannot understand why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we must admit that religion is a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God is a product of the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as to why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich, and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.<ref name="religion">{{harvnb|Heisenberg|1971|pp=85–86}}</ref></blockquote>

Heisenberg's view was tolerant. Pauli, raised as a Catholic, had kept silent after some initial remarks, but when finally he was asked for his opinion, said: "Well, our friend Dirac has got a religion and its guiding principle is 'There is no God, and Paul Dirac is His prophet. {{' "}} Everybody, including Dirac, burst into laughter.<ref>{{harvnb|Heisenberg|1971|p=87}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=-TT_z4llWoIC&lpg=PP1&hl=de&pg=PA138#v=onepage&q&f=false 138]}}, who says this was an old joke, pointing out a [[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'']] footnote in the 1850s that "There is no God, and [[Harriet Martineau]] is her prophet."</ref>

Later in life, Dirac's views towards the idea of God were less acerbic.  As an author of an article appearing in the May 1963 edition of ''[[Scientific American]]'', Dirac wrote:
<blockquote>It seems to be one of the fundamental features of nature that fundamental [[physical law]]s are described in terms of a [[mathematical theory of great beauty]] and power, needing quite a high standard of mathematics for one to understand it. You may wonder: Why is nature constructed along these lines? One can only answer that our present knowledge seems to show that nature is so constructed. We simply have to accept it. One could perhaps describe the situation by saying that God is a mathematician of a very high order, and He used very advanced mathematics in constructing the universe. Our feeble attempts at mathematics enable us to understand a bit of the universe, and as we proceed to develop higher and higher mathematics we can hope to understand the universe better.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2010/06/25/the-evolution-of-the-physicists-picture-of-nature/ |title=The Evolution of the Physicist's Picture of Nature |last1=Dirac |first1=Paul |date=May 1963 |work=Scientific American |access-date=4 April 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

In 1971, at a conference meeting, Dirac expressed his views on the existence of God.<ref>{{harvnb|Kragh|1990|pp=256–257}}</ref> Dirac explained that the existence of God could be justified only if an improbable event were to have taken place in the past:

<blockquote>It could be that it is extremely difficult to [[Abiogenesis|start life]]. It might be that it is so difficult to start a life that it has happened only once among all the planets... Let us consider, just as a conjecture, that the chance of life starting when we have got suitable physical conditions is 10<sup>−100</sup>. I don't have any logical reason for proposing this figure, I just want you to consider it as a possibility. Under those conditions ... it is almost certain that life would not have started. And I feel that under those conditions it will be necessary to assume the existence of a god to start off life. I would like, therefore, to set up this connection between the existence of a god and the physical laws: if physical laws are such that to start off life involves an excessively small chance so that it will not be reasonable to suppose that life would have started just by blind chance, then there must be a god, and such a god would probably be showing his influence in the quantum jumps which are taking place later on. On the other hand, if life can start very easily and does not need any divine influence, then I will say that there is no god.<ref>{{harvnb|Kragh|1990}}</ref></blockquote>

Dirac did not commit himself to any definite view, but he described the possibilities for scientifically answering the question of God.<ref>{{harvnb|Kragh|1990}}</ref>

==Career==
Dirac established the most general theory of quantum mechanics and discovered the relativistic equation for the electron, which now bears his name. The remarkable notion of an antiparticle to each fermion particle – e.g. the positron as antiparticle to the electron – stems from his equation. He was the first to develop quantum field theory, which underlies all theoretical work on sub-atomic or "elementary" particles today, work that is fundamental to our understanding of the forces of nature. He proposed and investigated the concept of a [[magnetic monopole]], an object not yet known empirically, as a means of bringing even greater symmetry to [[James Clerk Maxwell]]'s equations of [[electromagnetism]].

===Quantum theory===
Dirac's first step into a new quantum theory was taken late in September 1925. [[Ralph Fowler]], his research supervisor, had received a proof copy of an [[Über quantentheoretischer Umdeutung|exploratory paper]] by [[Werner Heisenberg]] in the framework of the old quantum theory of Bohr and [[Arnold Sommerfeld|Sommerfeld]]. Heisenberg leaned heavily on Bohr's correspondence principle but changed the equations so that they involved directly observable quantities, leading to the [[matrix mechanics|matrix formulation]] of quantum mechanics. Fowler sent Heisenberg's paper on to Dirac, who was on vacation in Bristol, asking him to look into this paper carefully.<ref>{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|pp=83–88}}</ref>

Dirac's attention was drawn to a mysterious mathematical relationship, at first sight unintelligible, that Heisenberg had established. Several weeks later, back in Cambridge, Dirac suddenly recognised that this mathematical form had the same structure as the [[Poisson bracket]]s that occur in the [[classical mechanics|classical dynamics]] of particle motion.<ref>{{harvnb|Farmelo|2009|pp=83–88}}</ref> At the time, his memory of Poisson brackets was rather vague, but he found [[E. T. Whittaker]]'s ''[[Analytical Dynamics of Particles and Rigid Bodies]]'' illuminating.<ref name="Coutinho12">{{Cite journal|last=Coutinho|first=S. C.|date=2014-05-01|title=Whittaker's analytical dynamics: a biography|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/s00407-013-0133-1|journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences|language=en|volume=68|issue=3|pages=355–407|doi=10.1007/s00407-013-0133-1|issn=1432-0657|s2cid=122266762}}</ref> From his new understanding, he developed a quantum theory based on [[Commutative property|non-commuting]] dynamical variables. This led him to the most profound and significant general formulation of quantum mechanics to date.<ref>{{cite web|title=Paul Dirac: a genius in the history of physics|url=http://cerncourier.com/cws/article/cern/28693|work=Cern Courier|access-date=13 May 2013|date=15 August 2002}}</ref> Dirac's formulation allowed him to obtain the [[quantization (physics)|quantisation]] rules in a [[Canonical quantization|novel and more illuminating manner]].

This formed the basis for [[Fermi-Dirac statistics]] that applies to systems consisting of many identical spin 1/2 particles (i.e. that obey the [[Pauli exclusion principle]]), e.g. electrons in solids and liquids, and importantly to the field of conduction in [[semiconductors|semi-conductors]].

Dirac was famously not bothered by [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|issues of interpretation in quantum theory]].  In fact, in a paper published in a book in his honour, he wrote: "The interpretation of quantum mechanics has been dealt with by many authors, and I do not want to discuss it here.  I want to deal with more fundamental things."<ref>Dirac, "The inadequacies of quantum field theory", in B. N. Kursunoglu & E. P. Wigner, eds., [https://books.google.com/books?id=1Pg7t9a_AX4C&printsec=frontcover ''Paul Adrien Maurice Dirac''] (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1987), p. 194.</ref>

===The Dirac equation===
{{details|Dirac equation}}
In 1928, building on 2×2 spin matrices which he purported to have discovered independently of [[Wolfgang Pauli]]'s work on non-relativistic [[spin (physics)|spin]] systems (Dirac told [[Abraham Pais]], "I believe I got these [matrices] independently of Pauli and possibly Pauli got these independently of me."),<ref>{{cite book|title=Reminiscences about a Great Physicist|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=1Pg7t9a_AX4C&pg=PA98 98]|editor1=Behram N. Kurşunoğlu |editor2=Eugene Paul Wigner }}</ref> he proposed the [[Dirac equation]] as a [[Special relativity|relativistic]] [[equation of motion]] for the [[wave function]] of the [[electron]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Dirac |first=P. A. M. |title=The Quantum Theory of the Electron  |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London A |date=1 February 1928 |volume=117 |issue=778 |pages=610–24 |doi=10.1098/rspa.1928.0023 |bibcode=1928RSPSA.117..610D|doi-access=free }}</ref> This work led Dirac to predict the existence of the [[positron]], the electron's [[antiparticle]], which he interpreted in terms of what came to be called the ''[[Dirac sea]]''.<ref>{{Nobelprize}} with his Nobel Lecture, December 12, 1933 ''Theory of Electrons and Positrons''</ref> The positron was observed by [[Carl David Anderson|Carl Anderson]] in 1932. Dirac's equation also contributed to explaining the origin of [[Spin (physics)|quantum spin]] as a relativistic phenomenon.

The necessity of [[fermion]]s (matter) being created and destroyed in [[Enrico Fermi]]'s 1934 theory of [[beta decay]] led to a reinterpretation of Dirac's equation as a "classical" [[field equation]] for any [[point particle]] of spin ''[[Planck constant|ħ]]''/2, itself subject to quantisation conditions involving [[Anticommutativity|anti-commutators]]. Thus reinterpreted, in 1934 by [[Werner Heisenberg]], as a (quantum) field equation accurately describing all elementary matter particles – today [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s – this [[Dirac field]] equation is as central to theoretical physics as the [[Maxwell equations|Maxwell]], [[Yang–Mills theory|Yang–Mills]] and [[General relativity|Einstein]] field equations. Dirac is regarded as the founder of [[quantum electrodynamics]], being the first to use that term. He also introduced the idea of [[vacuum polarisation]] in the early 1930s. This work was key to the development of quantum mechanics by the next generation of theorists, in particular [[Julian Schwinger|Schwinger]], [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]], [[Sin-Itiro Tomonaga]] and [[Freeman Dyson|Dyson]] in their formulation of quantum electrodynamics.

Dirac's [[The Principles of Quantum Mechanics|''The'' ''Principles of Quantum Mechanics'']], published in 1930, is a landmark in the [[history of science]]. It quickly became one of the standard textbooks on the subject and is still used today. In that book, Dirac incorporated the previous work of [[Werner Heisenberg]] on [[matrix mechanics]] and of [[Erwin Schrödinger]] on [[Schrödinger equation|wave mechanics]] into a single mathematical formalism that associates measurable quantities to operators acting on the [[Hilbert space]] of vectors that describe the state of a [[physical system]]. The book also introduced the [[Dirac delta function]]. Following his 1939 article,<ref>{{cite journal|author=P. A. M. Dirac |year=1939 |title=A New Notation for Quantum Mechanics |journal=Proceedings of the Cambridge Philosophical Society |volume=35 |issue=3 |page=416 |doi=10.1017/S0305004100021162 |bibcode=1939PCPS...35..416D|s2cid=121466183 |url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/71a5cbcd93359b91b03eac0b77efc44993142898 }}</ref> he also included the [[bra–ket notation]] in the third edition of his book,<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Gieres |doi=10.1088/0034-4885/63/12/201 |title=Mathematical surprises and Dirac's formalism in quantum mechanics |year=2000 |volume=63 |issue=12 |page=1893 |journal=Reports on Progress in Physics |arxiv=quant-ph/9907069 |bibcode = 2000RPPh...63.1893G|s2cid=10854218 }}</ref> thereby contributing to its universal use nowadays.

===Magnetic monopoles===
In 1931, Dirac proposed that the existence of a single magnetic monopole in the universe would suffice to explain the quantisation of electrical charge.<ref>

===Gravity===
He quantized the gravitational field and developed a general theory of the [[quantum field]] with dynamical constraints, which forms the basis of the [[Gauge theory|gauge theories]] and [[Superstring theory|superstring theories]] of today.<ref>[[Mikhail Shifman|Misha, S.]], ''Quantum Field Theory II'' ([[Singapore]]: [[World Scientific]], 2019), [https://books.google.com/books?id=EbySDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA287 p. 287].</ref> The influence and importance of Dirac's work have increased with the decades, and physicists use the concepts and equations that he developed daily.

===Lucasian Chair===
Dirac was the [[Lucasian Professor of Mathematics]] at Cambridge from 1932 to 1969.  In 1937, he proposed a speculative [[Physical cosmology|cosmological]] model based on the so-called [[Dirac large numbers hypothesis|large numbers hypothesis]]. During World War II, he conducted important theoretical and experimental research on [[uranium enrichment]] by [[gas centrifuge]].<ref>Kemp, R. S., [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228424622_Gas_Centrifuge_Theory_and_Development_A_Review_of_US_Programs "Gas Centrifuge Theory and Development: A Review of US Programs"], ''Science and Global Security'', June 2009.</ref>

Dirac's [[quantum electrodynamics]] (QED) made predictions that were – more often than not – infinite and therefore unacceptable. A workaround known as [[renormalisation]] was developed, but Dirac never accepted this. "I must say that I am very dissatisfied with the situation", he said in 1975, "because this so-called 'good theory' does involve neglecting infinities which appear in its equations, neglecting them in an arbitrary way. This is just not sensible mathematics. Sensible mathematics involves neglecting a quantity when it is small – not neglecting it just because it is infinitely great and you do not want it!"<ref>{{harvnb|Kragh|1990|p=184}}</ref> His refusal to accept [[renormalisation]] resulted in his work on the subject moving increasingly out of the mainstream.

However, from his once rejected notes he managed to work on putting quantum electrodynamics on "logical foundations" based on [[Hamiltonian formalism]] that he formulated. He found a rather novel way of deriving the [[anomalous magnetic moment]] "Schwinger term" and also the [[Lamb shift]], afresh in 1963, using the Heisenberg picture and without using the joining method used by [[Victor Weisskopf|Weisskopf]] and French, and by the two pioneers of modern QED, [[Julian Schwinger|Schwinger]] and [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]]. That was two years before the Tomonaga–Schwinger–Feynman QED was given formal recognition by an award of the Nobel Prize for physics.

Weisskopf and French (FW) were the first to obtain the correct result for the Lamb shift and the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron. At first FW results did not agree with the incorrect but independent results of Feynman and Schwinger.<ref>{{harvnb|Schweber|1994}}</ref> The 1963–1964 lectures Dirac gave on quantum field theory at [[Yeshiva University]] were published in 1966 as the Belfer Graduate School of Science, Monograph Series Number, 3. After having relocated to Florida to be near his elder daughter, Mary, Dirac spent his last fourteen years (of both life and physics research) at the [[University of Miami]] in [[Coral Gables, Florida]], and [[Florida State University]] in [[Tallahassee, Florida]].

In the 1950s in his search for a better QED, Paul Dirac developed the Hamiltonian theory of constraints<ref>''[[Canadian Journal of Mathematics]]'', 1950, vol 2, 129; 1951, vol 3, 1.</ref> based on lectures that he delivered at the 1949 [[International Congress of Mathematicians|International Mathematical Congress]] in Canada. Dirac<ref>1951 "The Hamiltonian Form of Field Dynamics" ''Canad Jour Math'', vol 3, 1</ref> had also solved the problem of putting the [[Schwinger–Tomonaga equation]] into the Schrödinger representation<ref>Phillips R. J. N. 1987 ''Tributes to Dirac'' p31 London: Adam Hilger</ref> and given explicit expressions for the [[Scalar field|scalar meson field]] ([[pion|spin zero pion]] or [[pseudoscalar meson]]), the vector meson field (spin one rho meson), and the electromagnetic field (spin one massless boson, photon).

The Hamiltonian of constrained systems is one of Dirac's many masterpieces. It is a powerful generalisation of Hamiltonian theory that remains valid for curved spacetime. The equations for the Hamiltonian involve only six degrees of freedom described by <math>g_{rs}</math>,<math>p^{rs}</math> for each point of the surface on which the state is considered. The  <math>g_{m0}</math> (''m'' = 0, 1, 2, 3) appear in the theory only through the variables <math>g^{r0}</math>, <math> ( -{g^{00}} ) ^{-1/2}</math> which occur as arbitrary coefficients in the equations of motion.
There are four constraints or weak equations for each point of the surface <math>x^0</math> = constant. Three of them <math>H_r</math> form the four vector density in the surface. The fourth <math>H_L</math> is a 3-dimensional scalar density in the surface ''H''<sub>L</sub> ≈ 0; ''H<sub>r</sub>'' ≈ 0 (''r'' = 1, 2, 3)

In the late 1950s, he applied the Hamiltonian methods he had developed to cast Einstein's general relativity in Hamiltonian form<ref>[[Proceedings of the Royal Society#Proceedings of the Royal Society A|''Proc Roy Soc'']] 1958, A vol 246, 333</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Dirac |first1=P. A. M. |title=Fixation of Coordinates in the Hamiltonian Theory of Gravitation |journal=Physical Review |date=1 May 1959 |volume=114 |issue=3 |page=924 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.114.924 |bibcode=1959PhRv..114..924D |url=https://journals.aps.org/pr/abstract/10.1103/PhysRev.114.924 |access-date=16 October 2020}}</ref> and to bring to a technical completion the quantization problem of gravitation and bring it also closer to the rest of physics according to Salam and DeWitt. In 1959 he also gave an invited talk on "Energy of the Gravitational Field" at the New York Meeting of the American Physical Society.<ref>Dirac, P. A. M., [https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.2.368 "Energy of the Gravitational Field"], ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'', Vol. 2, Nr. 8, 20 March 1959, pp. 368–371.</ref> In 1964 he published his ''Lectures on Quantum Mechanics'' (London: Academic) which deals with constrained dynamics of nonlinear dynamical systems including quantization of curved spacetime. He also published a paper entitled "Quantization of the Gravitational Field" in the 1967 ICTP/IAEA Trieste Symposium on Contemporary Physics.

=== Professorship at Florida State University ===

From September 1970 to January 1971, Dirac was a Visiting Professor at Florida State University in Tallahassee. During that time he was offered a permanent position there, which he accepted, becoming a full professor in 1972. Contemporary accounts of his time there describe it as happy except that he apparently found the summer heat oppressive and liked to escape from it to Cambridge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.famousscientists.org/paul-dirac/|title=Paul Dirac|website=Famous Scientists}}</ref>

He would walk about a mile to work each day and was fond of swimming in one of the two nearby lakes (Silver Lake and Lost Lake), and was also more sociable than he had been at Cambridge, where he mostly worked at home apart from giving classes and seminars; at FSU he would usually eat lunch with his colleagues before taking a nap.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pais|first=Abraham|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/958553083|title=Paul Dirac: The Man and His Work|page=27|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-511-56431-4|oclc=958553083|via=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hm22wB0wGFcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Google Books]}}</ref>

Dirac published over 60 papers in those last twelve years of his life, including a short book on general relativity.<ref>Baer, H. A., & Belyaev, A., eds., ''Proceedings of the Dirac Centennial Symposium'' (Singapore: World Scientific, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=9RvJCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA3 p. 3].</ref> His last paper (1984), entitled "The inadequacies of quantum field theory," contains his final judgment on quantum field theory: "These rules of renormalisation give surprisingly, excessively good agreement with experiments. Most physicists say that these working rules are, therefore, correct. I feel that is not an adequate reason. Just because the results happen to be in agreement with observation does not prove that one's theory is correct." The paper ends with the words: "I have spent many years searching for a Hamiltonian to bring into the theory and have not yet found it. I shall continue to work on it as long as I can and other people, I hope, will follow along such lines."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pais|first=Abraham|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/958553083|title=Paul Dirac: The Man and His Work|page=28|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-511-56431-4|oclc=958553083|via=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hm22wB0wGFcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false Google Books]}}</ref>

==Legacy==
In 1975, Dirac gave a series of five lectures at the [[University of New South Wales]] which were subsequently published as a book, ''Directions in Physics'' (1978). He donated the royalties from this book to the university for the establishment of the [[Dirac Prize|Dirac Lecture Series]]. The [[Dirac Medal#The Dirac Medal and Lecture (University of New South Wales)|Silver Dirac Medal for the Advancement of Theoretical Physics]] is awarded by the [[University of New South Wales]] to commemorate the lecture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/ANNUAL_REPORTS/2004/school7.html |title=Dirac Medal awards |publisher=University of New South Wales |access-date=4 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130412032421/http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/ANNUAL_REPORTS/2004/school7.html |archive-date=12 April 2013  }}</ref>

Immediately after his death, two organizations of professional physicists established annual [[Dirac Prize|awards in Dirac's memory]]. The [[Institute of Physics]], the United Kingdom's professional body for physicists, awards the Paul Dirac Medal for "outstanding contributions to theoretical (including mathematical and computational) physics".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iop.org/about/awards/gold/dirac/page_38427.html |title=The Dirac Medal | publisher=[[Institute of Physics]] | access-date=24 November 2007}}</ref> The first three recipients were [[Stephen Hawking]] (1987), [[John Stewart Bell]] (1988), and [[Roger Penrose]] (1989).

==Publications==
* ''[[The Principles of Quantum Mechanics]]'' (1930): This book summarises the ideas of quantum mechanics using the modern formalism that was largely developed by Dirac himself. Towards the end of the book, he also discusses the relativistic theory of the electron (the [[Dirac equation]]), which was also pioneered by him. This work does not refer to any other writings then available on quantum mechanics.
* ''Lectures on Quantum Mechanics'' (1966): Much of this book deals with quantum mechanics in [[curved space-time]].
* ''Lectures on Quantum Field Theory'' (1966): This book lays down the foundations of [[quantum field theory]] using the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formalism.
* ''Spinors in Hilbert Space'' (1974): This book based on lectures given in 1969 at the University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida, USA, deals with the basic aspects of [[spinor]]s starting with a real [[Hilbert space]] formalism. Dirac concludes with the prophetic words "We have [[boson]] variables appearing automatically in a theory that starts with only [[fermion]] variables, provided the number of fermion variables is infinite. There must be such [[boson]] variables connected with [[electron]]s..."
* ''General Theory of Relativity'' (1975): This 69-page work summarises Einstein's general theory of relativity.
