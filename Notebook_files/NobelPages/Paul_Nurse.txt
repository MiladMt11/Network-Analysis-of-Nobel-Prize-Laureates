==Early life and education==
Nurse's mother went from [[London]] to [[Norwich]], [[Norfolk]] and lived with relatives while awaiting Paul's birth (at the age of 18)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/aug/09/paul-nurse-birth-certificate-not-mothers-name|title=Sir Paul Nurse: 'I looked at my birth certificate.

Paul was brought up by his grandparents (whom he took to be his parents) in North West London.<ref name=mother>{{cite news|last1=Nurse|first1=Sir Paul|title=Sir Paul Nurse: 'I looked at my birth certificate.

Nurse did not know that his "sister" was in fact his mother until he was in his 50s: his application for a [[green card]] for US residency while president of [[Rockefeller University]] was, to his surprise, rejected, despite his being a Nobel Prize winner, president of a university and a knight; this was because he had submitted a short-form UK birth certificate which did not name his parents. When he applied for a full birth certificate he discovered the truth, to his astonishment.<ref name=mother/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/aug/15/sir-paul-nurse-the-uk-has-taken-a-leap-several-decades-into-the-past |title=Sir Paul Nurse: 'The UK has taken a leap several decades into the past' |newspaper=The Guardian |author=Andrew Anthony |date= 15 August 2020}}</ref>

==Career and research==
Nurse continued his [[postdoctoral research]] at the laboratory of [[Murdoch Mitchison]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]] for the next six years (1973–1979).<ref name="Nobel">{{Nobelprize|accessdate=28 April 2020}} including the Nobel Lecture Nobel Lecture 9 December 2001 ''Controlling the Cell Cycle''</ref><ref name="pmid27270696">{{cite journal|author1= Fantes PA |author2=Hoffman CS| title = A Brief History of Schizosaccharomyces pombe Research: A Perspective Over the Past 70 Years.|journal = [[Genetics (journal)|Genetics]]| volume = 203| issue = 2| pages = 621–9|date=2016| pmid = 27270696| doi =10.1534/genetics.116.189407| pmc = 4896181}}</ref>

Beginning in 1976, Nurse identified the gene ''[[cdc2]]'' in [[fission yeast]]<ref>{{Cite journal

}}</ref> (''[[Schizosaccharomyces pombe]]''). This gene controls the progression of the cell cycle from [[G1 phase]] to [[S phase]] and the transition from [[G2 phase]] to [[mitosis]]. In 1987, Nurse identified the homologous gene in human, ''[[Cdk1]]'', which codes for a [[cyclin dependent kinase]].<ref>{{Cite journal

Working in fission yeast, Nurse identified the gene cdc2, which controls the transition from G1 to S, when the cell grows in preparation for the duplication of DNA, and G2 to M, when the cell divides. With his postdoc [[Melanie Lee]], Nurse also found the corresponding gene, CDK1, in humans. These genes stop and start cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) by adding or removing phosphate groups.<ref name="illpres">{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2001 - Illustrated Lecture |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2001/7743-the-nobel-prize-in-physiology-or-medicine-2001/ |website=The Nobel Prize |access-date=14 October 2021}}</ref>

In 1984, Nurse joined the [[Imperial Cancer Research Fund]] (ICRF, now [[Cancer Research UK]]). He left in 1988 to chair the department of microbiology at the [[University of Oxford]]. He then returned to the ICRF as Director of Research in 1993, and in 1996 was named Director General of the ICRF, which became Cancer Research UK in 2002. In 2003, he became president of [[Rockefeller University]] in [[New York City]]<ref name="tg-2003sep17">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2003/sep/18/scienceinterviews.science |title=Paul Nurse talks to Ian Sample about money, moustaches, and his move to Manhattan |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 September 2003 |first=Ian |last=Sample}}</ref> where he continued work on the cell cycle of fission yeast.  In 2011 Nurse became the first Director and Chief Executive of the [[Francis Crick Institute|UK Centre for Medical Research and Innovation]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukcmri.ac.uk/press/press_release6.html |title=Project Press Release |access-date=11 August 2010 |publisher=UK Centre for Medical Research and Innovation web site |date=15 July 2010 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> now the [[Francis Crick Institute]].

On 30 November 2010, Nurse succeeded astrophysicist [[Martin Rees]] for a five-year term as [[List of presidents of the Royal Society|President of the Royal Society]] until 2015.

Nurse has said good scientists must have passion "to know the answer to the questions" that interest them, along with good technical ability, and a set of attitudes including mental honesty, self-criticism, open-mindedness and scepticism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_kijV323VQ|title=Unavailable private video|website=youtube.com}}</ref>

As an undergraduate student at Birmingham, Nurse sold ''[[Socialist Worker]]'', and participated in an occupation of the vice-chancellor's office.<ref name="ObserverHomeTruths">{{cite web |last=McKie |first=Robin |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2010/oct/24/profile-paul-nurse-dna-genes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305081022/http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2010/oct/24/profile-paul-nurse-dna-genes|archive-date=2016-03-05 |title= Paul Nurse: Home truths for the gene genius |publisher=[[The Observer]] |location=London |date=2010-10-24 |website=theguardian.com }}</ref><ref name="NSPaulNurse">{{cite news |last=Brooks |first=Michael |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/ideas/2011/06/british-science-nurse-society |title=The Science Interview – Paul Nurse |work=[[New Statesman]] |location=London |publisher=Progressive Media International |date=2011-06-09 |access-date=2015-07-13 }}</ref> As a graduate student at East Anglia he continued to sell ''Socialist Worker'', and was sympathetic to the [[International Socialist Tendency]] but never formally joined the movement.<ref name="THEGibson">{{cite news |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/features/somehow-i-knew-id-see-you-again-you-bastard/177668.article |title=Somehow, I knew I'd see you again, you bastard |work=[[Times Higher Education]] |publisher=TES Global |date=2003-06-27 |access-date=2015-07-13 }}</ref>

Nurse has criticized potential [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] candidates for the US presidential nomination for opposing the teaching of natural selection, stem cell research on cell lines from human embryos, and anthropogenic climate change, even partially blaming scientists for not speaking up.<ref name="politics">[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21128302.900-stamp-out-antiscience-in-us-politics.html Stamp out anti-science; it's time to reject political movements that turn their backs on science], Paul Nurse, New Scientist, 17 September 2011</ref> He was alarmed that this could happen in the U.S., a world leader in science, "the home of [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Richard Feynman]] and [[James D. Watson|Jim Watson]]."<ref name="politics"/>

One problem, Nurse said, was "treating scientific discussion as if it were political debate," using rhetorical tricks rather than logic. Another was the state of science teaching in the schools, which does not teach citizens how to discuss science – particularly in religious schools, even in the United Kingdom.<ref name="politics"/> Nurse has written that "we need to emphasise why the scientific process is such a reliable generator of knowledge with its respect for evidence, for scepticism, for consistency of approach, for the constant testing of ideas."<ref name="politics"/> Furthermore, Nurse feels that scientific leaders "have a responsibility to expose the bunkum". They should take on politicians, and expose nonsense during elections.<ref name="politics"/>

In August 2014, Nurse was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to ''[[The Guardian]]'' expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September's [[2014 Scottish independence referendum|referendum on that issue]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/aug/07/celebrities-open-letter-scotland-independence-full-text |title=Celebrities' open letter to Scotland – full text and list of signatories |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=7 August 2014 |access-date=26 August 2014}}</ref>

Nurse believes that scientists should speak out about science in public affairs and challenge politicians who support policies based on pseudoscience.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nurse |first=Paul|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21128302.900-stamp-out-antiscience-in-us-politics.html|title=Stamp out anti-science in US politics|website=New Scientist}}</ref>
