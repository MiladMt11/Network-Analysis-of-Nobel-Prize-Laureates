'''Tu Youyou''' ({{zh |c = 屠呦呦 |p = Tú Yōuyōu }}; born 30 December 1930) is a Chinese [[Medicinal chemistry|pharmaceutical chemist]] and malariologist. She discovered [[artemisinin]] (also known as ''qīnghāosù'' 青蒿素) and [[dihydroartemisinin]], used to treat [[malaria]], a breakthrough in twentieth-century [[tropical medicine]], saving millions of lives in [[South China]], [[Southeast Asia]], Africa, and South America.

For her work, Tu received the 2011 [[Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research|Lasker Award]] in clinical medicine and the 2015 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] jointly with [[William C. Campbell (scientist)|William C. Campbell]] and [[Satoshi Ōmura]]. Tu is the first Chinese [[Nobel prize in physiology or medicine|Nobel laureate in physiology or medicine]] and the first female citizen of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] to receive a Nobel Prize in any category. She is also the first Chinese person to receive the [[Lasker Award]].

She attended [[Xiaoshi Middle School]] for junior high school and the first year of high school, before transferring to [[Ningbo Middle School]] in 1948. A tuberculosis infection interrupted her high-school education, but inspired her to go into medical research.<ref name="NobelBio">{{Cite web |url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2015/tu-bio.html|title=Youyou Tu – Biographical |website = www.nobelprize.org |access-date=2018-04-22 }}</ref> From 1951 to 1955, she attended [[Peking University]] Medical School / Beijing Medical College.{{NoteTag |name = Medical_School }} In 1955, Youyou Tu graduated from Beijing Medical University School of Pharmacy and continued her research on Chinese herbal medicine in the China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences. Tu studied at the Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, and graduated in 1955. Later Tu was trained for two and a half years in [[traditional Chinese medicine]].

After graduation, Tu worked at the Academy of Traditional Chinese Medicine (now the China Academy of Traditional Chinese Medical Sciences{{NoteTag |name = CACMS }}) in Beijing.

== Research career ==
Tu carried on her work in the 1960s and 70s, including during China's [[Cultural Revolution]].

=== Schistosomiasis ===
During her early years in research, Tu studied ''[[Lobelia chinensis]]'', a traditional Chinese medicine for curing [[schistosomiasis]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tu |first1=Youyou |title=Tu Youyou Biographical |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2015/tu/biographical/ |website=NobelPrize.org |access-date=10 October 2020}}</ref> caused by [[Trematoda|trematodes]] which infect the [[urinary tract]] or the [[intestines]], which was widespread in the first half of the 20th century in South China.{{Citation needed |date = September 2011}}

=== Malaria ===
{{Further|Project 523|artemisinin|dihydroartemisinin}}

In 1967, during the [[Vietnam War]], President [[Ho Chi Minh]] of [[North Vietnam]] asked Chinese Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] for help in developing a malaria treatment for his soldiers trooping down the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]], where a majority came down with a form of malaria which is resistant to [[chloroquine]]. Because malaria was also a major cause of death in China's southern provinces, especially [[Guangdong]], and [[Guangxi]], Zhou Enlai convinced [[Mao Zedong]] to set up a secret drug discovery project named [[Project 523]] after its starting date, 23{{nbsp}}May 1967.<ref name="McKenna">[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21228382.000-the-modest-woman-who-beat-malaria-for-china.html "The modest woman who beat malaria for China"], by Phil McKenna, ''New Scientist'', 15 November 2011</ref>

In early 1969, Tu was appointed head of the [[Project 523]] research group at her institute. Tu was initially sent to Hainan where she studied patients who had been infected with the disease.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/oct/05/youyou-tu-how-maos-challenge-to-malaria-pioneer-led-to-nobel-prize |title = Tu Youyou: how Mao's challenge to malaria pioneer led to Nobel prize |author = Tom Phillips |date = 6 October 2015 |work = The Guardian}}</ref>

Scientists worldwide had screened over 240,000 compounds without success.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Nobel Prize {{!}} Women who changed science {{!}} Tu Youyou|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/womenwhochangedscience/stories/tu-youyou|access-date=2021-11-16|website=www.nobelprize.org|language=en}}</ref> In 1969, Tu, then 39 years old, had an idea of screening Chinese herbs. She first investigated the Chinese medical classics in history, visiting practitioners of [[traditional Chinese medicine]] all over the country on her own. She gathered her findings in a notebook called ''A Collection of Single Practical Prescriptions for Anti-Malaria''. Her notebook summarized 640 prescriptions.  By 1971, her team had screened over 2,000 traditional Chinese recipes and made 380 herbal [[extract]]s, from some 200 herbs, which were tested on mice.<ref name="McKenna" />

One compound was effective, sweet wormwood (''[[Artemisia annua]]''), which was used for "intermittent fevers," a hallmark of malaria. As Tu also presented at the project seminar, its preparation was described in a 1,600-year-old text, in a recipe titled, "Emergency Prescriptions Kept Up One's Sleeve". At first, it was ineffective because they extracted it with traditional boiling water. Tu Youyou discovered that a low-temperature extraction process could be used to isolate an effective antimalarial substance from the plant;<ref name="L Award Description">{{cite web |last = Strauss |first = Evelyn |title = Award Description |url = http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/2011_c_description.htm |work = Lasker–DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award |publisher = [[Lasker Foundation]] |location = New York |date = September 2011 }}</ref> Tu says she was influenced by a [[Chinese herbology|traditional Chinese herbal medicine]] source, ''The Handbook of Prescriptions for Emergency Treatments'', written in 340 by [[Ge Hong]], which states that this herb should be steeped in cold water.<ref name="scimag">{{cite web |url = http://news.sciencemag.org/asia/2011/09/lasker-award-rekindles-debate-over-artemisinins-discovery |title = Lasker Award Rekindles Debate Over Artemisinin's Discovery  |publisher = News.sciencemag.org |access-date = 7 January 2014|date = 29 September 2011 }}</ref> This book contained the direction to immerse a handful of qinghao in the equivalent of 0.4 litres of water, wring out the juice and drink it all.<ref name="Miller"/> After rereading the recipe, Tu realised the hot water had already damaged the active ingredient in the plant; therefore she proposed a method using low-temperature ether to extract the effective compound instead. The [[Animal testing|animal tests]] showed it was completely effective in mice and monkeys.<ref name="McKenna" />

In 1972, she and her colleagues obtained the pure substance and named it ''qinghaosu'' ([[:zh:青蒿素|青蒿素]]), or [[artemisinin]] as it is known in English,<ref name="L Award Description" /><ref name="th Anniversary">{{cite web |url = http://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules/special_issues/artemisinin/ |title = Special Issue Artemisinin (Qinghaosu): Commemorative Issue in Honor of Professor Youyou Tu on the Occasion of her 80th Anniversary |publisher = [[Molecules (journal)|Molecules]] |first = Geoff |last = Brown |year = 2010 |access-date = 14 September 2011 }}</ref><ref name="Acceptance remarks by Tu">{{cite web |last = Tu |first = Youyou |title = Acceptance remarks by Tu Youyou |url = http://www.laskerfoundation.org/awards/2011_c_accept_youyou.htm |work = Lasker–DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award |publisher = [[Lasker Foundation]] |location = New York |quote = Equipped with a sound knowledge in both traditional Chinese medicine and modern pharmaceutical sciences, my team inherited and developed the essence of traditional Chinese medicine using modern science and technology and eventually, we successfully accomplished the discovery and development of qinghaosu from qinghao (Artemisia annua L).}}</ref> which has saved millions of lives, especially in the [[developing world]].<ref name="Tu – USA TODAY">{{cite web |url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/story/2011-09-12/lasker-awards/50371124/1 |title = 'America's Nobel' awarded to Chinese scientist |publisher = [[USA Today]] |first = Elizabeth |last = Weise |date = 12 September 2011 |access-date = 12 September 2011 }}</ref> Tu also studied the [[chemical structure]] and pharmacology of artemisinin.<ref name="L Award Description" /> Tu's group first determined the chemical structure of artemisinin. In 1973, Tu wanted to confirm the [[carbonyl group]] in the artemisinin molecule, therefore she accidentally synthesized dihydroartemisinin.

Furthermore, Tu volunteered to be the first human subject. "As head of this research group, I had the responsibility" she said. It was safe, so she conducted successful clinical trials with human patients. Her work was published anonymously in 1977.<ref name="McKenna" /> In 1981, she presented the findings relating to artemisinin at a meeting with the World Health Organization.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/10/06/how-a-secret-chinese-military-drug-based-on-an-ancient-herb-won-the-nobel-prize/ |title = How a secret Chinese military drug based on an ancient herb won the Nobel Prize |date = 6 October 2015 |last = Guo |first = Jeff |website =[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title = The discovery of artemisinin (qinghaosu) and gifts from Chinese medicine |last = Tu |first = Youyou |date = 11 October 2011 |publisher = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |doi = 10.1038/nm.2471 |pmid = 21989013 |volume=17 |issue = 10 |journal=Nature Medicine |pages = 1217–1220 |s2cid = 10021463 }}</ref>

For her work on malaria, she was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine on 5 October 2015.
