'''George Andrew Olah''' (born '''Oláh András György'''; May 22, 1927 – March 8, 2017) was a Hungarian [[chemist]]. After the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], he emigrated to the [[United Kingdom]], which he left for [[Canada]] in 1964, finally resettling in the [[United States]] in 1965. His research involved the generation and reactivity of [[carbocation]]s via [[superacids]]. For this research, Olah was awarded a [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] in 1994 "for his contribution to carbocation chemistry."<ref name=nobelprize>{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1994/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1994|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|access-date=December 22, 2008}}</ref>  He was also awarded the [[Priestley Medal]], the highest honor granted by the [[American Chemical Society]] and [[F.

==Early life and education==
Olah was born in [[Budapest]], Hungary, on May 22, 1927, to a Jewish couple, Magda (Krasznai) and Gyula Oláh, a lawyer.<ref>[https://hungarytoday.hu/news/olah-gyorgy-nobel-prize-awarded-hungarian-american-chemist-dies-aged-89-56604 GEORGE OLÁH, NOBEL PRIZE WINNING HUNGARIAN-AMERICAN CHEMIST, DIES AT 89] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309135443/http://hungarytoday.hu/news/olah-gyorgy-nobel-prize-awarded-hungarian-american-chemist-dies-aged-89-56604 |date=March 9, 2017 }}, Hungary Today, March 9, 2017</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1994/olah-autobio.html|title=George A. Olah – Biographical|access-date=March 15, 2017}}</ref> After the high school of Budapesti Piarista Gimnazium ([[Piarists|Scolopi fathers]]), he studied under organic chemist [[Géza Zemplén]] at the Technical University of Budapest, now the [[Budapest University of Technology and Economics]], where he earned M.S. and Ph.D degrees in Chemical Engineering.<ref name="wiley"/> From 1949 through 1954, he taught at the school as a professor of organic chemistry.<ref name="scalacs"/> In the subsequent two years, from 1954 to 1956, he worked at the Research Institute of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]], where he was Associate Scientific Director and Head of the Department of Organic Chemistry.<ref name="scalacs"/>

==Career and research==
As a result of the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution]], he and his family moved briefly to England and then to Canada, where he joined [[Dow Chemical]] in [[Sarnia]], Ontario, with another Hungarian chemist, Stephen J. Kuhn. Olah's pioneering work on carbocations started during his eight years with Dow.<ref>{{cite book | author = George A. Olah | title = Friedel-Crafts and Related Reactions | publisher = John Wiley and Sons|location=New York | year = 1965}}</ref> In 1965, he returned to academia at [[Case Western Reserve University]] in Cleveland, Ohio, chairing the Department of Chemistry from 1965 to 1969, and from 1967 through 1977 he was the C. F. Maybery Distinguished Professor of Research in Chemistry.<ref name="scalacs"/> In 1971, Olah became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States.<ref name="wiley">{{cite book|last=Mathew|first=Thomas|author2=George Andrew Olah | title=A Life of Magic Chemistry: Autobiographical Reflections Including Post-Nobel Prize Years and the Methanol Economy | chapter=Curriculum Vitae of George Andrew Olah | publisher=John Wiley & Sons, Inc. | location=Hoboken, NJ, USA | date=April 24, 2015 | isbn=978-1-118-84010-8 | doi=10.1002/9781118840108.oth | pages=300–305}}</ref> He then moved to the [[University of Southern California]] in 1977.<ref name="wiley"/>

At USC, Olah was a distinguished professor and the director of the [[Loker Hydrocarbon Research Institute]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chem.usc.edu/faculty/Olah.html|title=Department of Chemistry|access-date=March 15, 2017}}</ref> Starting in 1980, he served as the Distinguished Donald P. and Katherine B. Loker Professor
of Chemistry and later became a distinguished professor in USC's School of Engineering.<ref name="wiley"/> In 1994, Olah was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] "for his contribution to [[carbocation]] chemistry".<ref>{{cite web | title = The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1994 | publisher = Nobelprize.org | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1994/index.html|access-date=March 11, 2017}}</ref> In particular, Olah's search for stable nonclassical [[carbocation]]s led to the discovery of protonated [[methane]] stabilized by [[superacids]], like FSO<sub>3</sub>H-SbF<sub>5</sub> ("[[Magic acid|Magic Acid]]").
:CH<sub>4</sub>  +  H<sup>+</sup>  →  CH<sub>5</sub><sup>+</sup>

Because these cations were able to be stabilized, scientists could now use [[infrared spectroscopy]] and [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy|nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy]] to study them in greater depth, as well as use them as catalysts in organic synthesis reactions.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/chemistry-nobel-laureate-george-olah-dies-aged-89/2500536.article|title=Chemistry Nobel laureate George Olah dies aged 89|last=Stoye|first=Emma|date=March 10, 2017|publisher=Chemistry World|access-date=March 10, 2017}}</ref>

Olah, with Canadian chemist [[Saul Winstein]], was also involved in a career-long battle with [[Herbert C. Brown]] of [[Purdue]] over the existence of so-called "[[Non-classical ion|nonclassical]]" carbocations – such as the [[norbornane|norbornyl]] cation, which can be depicted as cationic character delocalized over several bonds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chemistry.ucla.edu/news/non-classical-cation-classic-case-conflict|title=The Non-classical Cation: A Classic Case of Conflict|date=July 11, 2013|publisher=UCLA Chemistry & Biochemistry|access-date=March 9, 2017}}</ref> Olah's studies of the cation with NMR spectroscopy provided more evidence suggesting that Winstein's model of the non-classical cation, "featuring a pair of [delocalized] electrons smeared between three carbon atoms," was correct.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.chemistryworld.com/opinion/the-nonclassical-cation-a-classic-case-of-conflict/6368.article|title=The nonclassical cation: a classic case of conflict|last=Peplow|first=Mark|date=July 10, 2013|publisher=Chemistry World|access-date=March 10, 2017}}</ref>

In 1997, the Olah family formed an [[Financial endowment|endowment fund]] (the George A. Olah Endowment) which grants annual awards to outstanding chemists, including the George A. Olah Award in Hydrocarbon or Petroleum Chemistry, formerly known as the ACS Award in Petroleum Chemistry. The awards are selected and administered by the [[American Chemical Society]].<ref>"George A. Olah Award in Hydrocarbon or Petroleum Chemistry", ''[[Chemical & Engineering News]]'', January 19, 2009, p. 74</ref>

Later in his career, his research shifted from [[hydrocarbon]]s and their transformation into fuel to the [[methanol economy]], namely generating methanol from methane.<ref name="CE">{{cite news|url=http://www.chemeurope.com/en/news/162300/nobel-prize-winner-of-1994-george-andrew-olah-dies-at-89.html|title=Nobel Prize winner of 1994 George Andrew Olah dies at 89|date=March 10, 2017|publisher=Chem Europe|access-date=March 10, 2017}}</ref> He joined with [[Robert Zubrin]], [[Anne Korin]], and [[James Woolsey]] in promoting a flexible-fuel mandate initiative.<ref>Olah, G.
