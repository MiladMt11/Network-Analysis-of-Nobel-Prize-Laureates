'''Gerhard Johannes Paul Domagk''' ({{IPA-de|ˈɡeːɐ̯haʁt ˈdoːmak|-|De-Gerhard Domagk.ogg}}; 30 October 1895 – 24 April 1964) was a [[Germany|German]] [[pathologist]] and [[bacteriologist]]. He is credited with the discovery of Sulfonamidochrysoidine (KI-730), the first commercially available [[antibiotic]] and marketed under the brand name [[Prontosil]], for which he received the 1939 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]].<ref name="nobelbio">{{Nobelprize}}</ref><ref name="nobel1939">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1939/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1939 Gerhard Domagk|publisher=Nobelprize.org|access-date=2010-07-02}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal

==Education==
Domagk was born in [[Łagów, Świebodzin County|Lagow]], [[Province of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], the son of a school headmaster. Until he was 14, he attended school in Sommerfeld (now [[Lubsko]], Poland).  Domagk studied [[medicine]] at the [[University of Kiel]], but volunteered to serve as a soldier in [[World War I]], where he was wounded in December 1914, working the rest of the war as a medic. After the war, he finished his studies, and worked at the [[University of Greifswald]], where he researched [[infection]]s caused by [[bacteria]].

==Career==
In 1925, he followed his professor Walter Gross to the [[University of Münster]] (WWU) and became a professor there himself. He also started working at the [[Bayer]] laboratories at [[Wuppertal]]. The same year, he married Gertrud Strube (1897–1985). Later they had three sons and a daughter.

Domagk was appointed director of Bayer's Institute of Pathology and Bacteriology, where he continued the studies of Josef Klarer and Fritz Mietzsch, based on works by [[Paul Ehrlich]], to use [[dye]]s, at that time a major product of [[IG Farben]], as [[antibiotic]]s. He found the [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide]] [[Prontosil]] to be effective against [[streptococcus]], and treated his own daughter with it, saving her the [[amputation]] of an arm.

In 1939, Domagk received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize in Medicine]] for this discovery, the first drug effective against [[bacterial infection]]s. He was forced by the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime to refuse the prize and was arrested by the [[Gestapo]] and detained for a week.<ref>[[Thomas Hager]], ''The Demon Under the Microscope'' (2006) {{ISBN|1-4000-8213-7}} (cited in [https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6667754 "The Saga of a Sulfa Drug Pioneer"] – [[NPR]] ''[[Weekend Edition]]'' 23 December 2006)</ref><ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/nobelprize_facts.html NobelPrize.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202025710/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/nobelprize_facts.html |date=2 February 2007 }}</ref><ref name="NobelBook">

}}</ref> (This was because the Nazi-critical [[Carl von Ossietzky]] had won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1935, which had angered the German government and resulted in German nationals not being permitted by law to accept the Nobel Prize.<ref name="NobelBook"/>) In the same year, Domagk was also awarded the [[Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh]]. In 1941 Domagk was awarded the ''Medaglia Paterno'' (Rome) by the [[Kingdom of Italy]] and also the Von-Klebelsberg-Medal and Prize by the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–46)|Kingdom of Hungary]]. He became a member of the [[German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina]] in 1942. Sulfonamides had revolutionary antibacterial effectiveness for their time, surpassing [[phage therapy]], but were later replaced by [[penicillin]], which showed both better effects and fewer [[Adverse drug reaction|side effects]] (sulfonamides can cause [[kidney stone]]s and changes in [[bone marrow]]). However, Domagk's work on sulfonamides eventually led to the development of the antituberculosis drugs [[thiosemicarbazone]] and [[isoniazid]], which helped to curb the epidemic of tuberculosis which swept Europe after World War II.

After the war, in 1947, Domagk was finally able to receive his Nobel Prize,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Chorba |first1=Terence |date=March 2018 |title=Peace, Liberty, Mycobacteria, and Tuberculosis Mortality  |journal=Emerg Infect Dis |volume= 24|issue=3 |pages=611–612 |doi=10.3201/eid2403.AC2403 |pmc=5823360 }}</ref> but not the monetary portion of the prize due to the time that had elapsed. In 1951, he was one of seven Nobel Laureates who attended the 1st [[Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings|Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org/laureates/meeting-1951|title=1st Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting - Laureates|website=www.mediatheque.lindau-nobel.org|access-date=2018-01-09}}</ref>

Domagk became a Foreign Member of the [[Royal Society]] in 1959; his short biography was published by the Royal Society in 1964.<ref name="frs">{{Cite journal | last1 = Colebrook | first1 = Leonard| author-link = Leonard Colebrook| doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1964.0003 | title = Gerhard Domagk 1895-1964 | journal = [[Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society]] | volume = 10 | pages = 38–50| year = 1964 | doi-access = free }}</ref><ref name="NobelBook"/> He changed his focus to [[tuberculosis]] and [[chemotherapy]] against [[cancer]]. He continued to live and work in Wuppertal. Domagk died from a appendicitis in Burgberg near [[Königsfeld im Schwarzwald|Königsfeld, Schwarzwald]]. He asked a medical student to remove his appendix but he did not succeed.
