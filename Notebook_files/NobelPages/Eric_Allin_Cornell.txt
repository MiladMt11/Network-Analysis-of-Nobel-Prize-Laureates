'''Eric Allin Cornell''' (born December 19, 1961) is an American physicist who, along with [[Carl E. Wieman]], was able to synthesize the first [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] in 1995. For their efforts, Cornell, Wieman, and [[Wolfgang Ketterle]] shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 2001.

==Biography==
Cornell was born in [[Palo Alto]], [[California]], where his parents were completing graduate degrees at nearby [[Stanford University]]. Two years later he moved to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], where his father was a professor of [[civil engineering]] at [[MIT]]. Here he grew up with his younger brother and sister, with yearlong intermezzos in [[Berkeley, California]], and [[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], where his father spent sabbatical years.<ref name="autobio">{{Cite web

In Cambridge he attended [[Cambridge Rindge and Latin|Cambridge Rindge and Latin School]]. The year before his graduation he moved back to California with his mother and finished high school at [[San Francisco]]'s [[Lowell High School (San Francisco)|Lowell High School]], a local [[magnet school]] for academically talented students.<ref name="autobio"/>

After high school he enrolled at [[Stanford University]], where he was to meet his future wife, Celeste Landry. As an undergraduate he earned money as an assistant in the various [[low-temperature physics]] groups on campus. He was doing well both in his courses and his jobs in the labs and seemed set for a career in physics. He however doubted whether he wished to pursue such a career, or rather a different one in literature or politics. Halfway through his undergraduate years he went to [[China]] and [[Taiwan]] for nine months to volunteer teaching conversational English and to study [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. He learned that this was not where his talents lay, and returned to Stanford with renewed resolve to pursue his true talent – physics. He graduated with honors and distinction in 1985.<ref name="autobio"/>

For graduate school he returned to MIT. There he joined [[David E. Pritchard|David Pritchard]]'s group, which had a running experiment that tried to measure the mass of the [[electron neutrino]] from the [[beta decay]] of [[tritium]]. Although he was unable to determine the [[mass of the neutrino]], Cornell did obtain his PhD in 1990.<ref name="autobio"/>

After obtaining his doctorate he joined [[Carl Wieman]] at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]] as a postdoctoral researcher on a small [[laser cooling]] experiment. During his two years as a postdoc he came up with a plan to combine [[laser cooling]] and [[Evaporative cooler|evaporative cooling]] in a magnetic trap to create a [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] (BEC). Based on his proposal he was offered a permanent position at [[JILA]]/[[NIST]] in Boulder.<ref name="autobio"/> For synthesizing the first Bose–Einstein condensate in 1995, Cornell, Wieman, and [[Wolfgang Ketterle]] shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 2001.

He is currently a professor at the [[University of Colorado Boulder]] and a physicist at the [[United States Department of Commerce]] [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]. His lab is located at [[JILA]]. He was awarded the [[Lorentz Medal]] in 1998 and is a [[Fellow of the AAAS|Fellow]] of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]].

He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2005.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter C|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterC.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=10 April 2011}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Cornell married Celeste Landry in 1995 mere months before the BEC experiment succeeded. Their first daughter, Eliza, was born in 1996, and their second daughter, Sophia, in 1998.<ref name="autobio" />

In October 2004, his left arm and shoulder were amputated in an attempt to stop the spread of [[necrotizing fasciitis]]. He was discharged from the hospital in mid-December, having recovered from the infection, and returned to work part-time in April 2005.<ref>[http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/3911587/detail.html News Article] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103201710/http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/3911587/detail.html |date=2011-01-03 }} from [[KMGH]]</ref>
