'''Ludwig Karl Martin Leonhard Albrecht Kossel''' ({{IPA-de|ˈalbʁɛçt ˈkɔsl̩|-|De-Albrecht Kossel.ogg}}; 16 September 1853 – 5 July 1927) was a German [[biochemist]] and pioneer in the study of [[genetics]]. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Physiology or Medicine]] in 1910 for his work in determining the chemical composition of [[nucleic acid]]s, the genetic substance of [[Cell (biology)|biological cells]].

Kossel isolated and described the five [[organic compounds]] that are present in [[nucleic acid]]: [[adenine]], [[cytosine]], [[guanine]], [[thymine]], and [[uracil]]. These compounds were later shown to be [[nucleobases]], and are key in the formation of [[DNA]] and [[RNA]], the genetic material found in all living cells.

Kossel was an important influence on and collaborator with other important researchers in biochemistry, including [[Henry Drysdale Dakin]], [[Friedrich Miescher]], [[Edwin B. Hart]], and his professor and mentor, [[Felix Hoppe-Seyler]]. Kossel was editor of the [[Biological Chemistry (journal)|Zeitschrift für Physiologische Chemie]] (Journal of Physiological Chemistry) from 1895 until his death.  Kossel also conducted important research into the composition of [[protein]], and his research predicted the discovery of the [[polypeptide]] nature of the protein molecule.

The [[Albrecht Kossel Institute for Neuroregeneration]] at the [[University of Rostock]] is named in his honor.

==Early life and education==
Kossel was born in [[Rostock]], Germany as the son of the [[merchant]] and [[Prussia]]n [[Consulate general|consul]] Albrecht Karl Ludwig Enoch Kossel and his wife Clara Jeppe Kossel. As a youth, Kossel attended the Gymnasium at Rostock, where he evidenced substantial interest in chemistry and botany.<ref name="Yale_Jones_1953"/>

In 1872, Kossel attended the [[University of Strassburg]] to study medicine. He studied under [[Felix Hoppe-Seyler]], who was head of the department of biochemistry, the only such institution in Germany at the time. He attended lectures by [[Anton de Bary]], [[Heinrich Wilhelm Gottfried von Waldeyer-Hartz|Waldeyer]], [[August Kundt]], and [[Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf von Baeyer|Baeyer]]. He completed his studies at [[University of Rostock]], and passed his German medical license exam in 1877.<ref name="Yale_Jones_1953"/>

==Early research and collaboration==
After completing his university studies, Kossel returned to the University of Strassburg as research assistant to Felix Hoppe-Seyler. At the time, Hoppe-Seyler was intensely interested in research concerning an acidic substance that had first been chemically isolated from pus cells by one of his former students, [[Friedrich Miescher]], in 1869. Unlike protein, the substance contained considerable amounts of phosphorus, but with its high acidity, it was unlike any cellular substance that had yet been observed.<ref name="Yale_Jones_1953"/>

Kossel showed that the substance, called "nuclein", consisted of a protein component and a non-protein component. Kossel further isolated and described the non-protein component. This substance has become known as ''[[nucleic acid]]'', which contains the genetic information found in all living cells.<ref name="Britannica"/>

==Isolation and description of nucleobases==
In 1883, Kossel left Strassburg to become Director of the Chemistry Division of the Physiological Institute at the [[University of Berlin]]. In this post, he succeeded [[Eugen Baumann]] and worked under the supervision of [[Emil du Bois-Reymond]].<ref name="Yale_Jones_1953"/>

Kossel continued his previous work on the nucleic acids. During the period 1885 to 1901, he was able to isolate and name its five constituent [[organic compounds]]: [[adenine]], [[cytosine]], [[guanine]], [[thymine]], and [[uracil]]. These compounds are now known collectively as [[nucleobases]], and they provide the molecular structure necessary in the formation of stable [[DNA]] and [[RNA]] molecules.<ref name="Britannica"/>

==Research into the chemical composition of protein==
In 1895, Kossel was professor of physiology as well as director of the Physiological Institute at the [[University of Marburg]]. Around this time, he began investigations into the chemical composition of [[protein]]s, the alterations in proteins during transformation into [[peptone]], the [[peptide]] components of cells, and other investigations.<ref name="Yale_Jones_1953"/>

In 1896, Kossel discovered [[histidine]], then worked out the classical method for the quantitative separation of the "hexone bases" (the [[alpha-amino acid]]s [[arginine]], [[histidine]], and [[lysine]]). He was also the first to isolate [[theophylline]], a therapeutic drug found naturally in tea and cocoa beans.

In 1901, Kossel was named to a similar post at [[Heidelberg University]], and became director of the Heidelberg Institute for Protein Investigation. His research predicted the discovery of the [[polypeptide]] nature of the protein molecule.<ref name="Yale_Jones_1953"/>

I seek to understand their habits, their peculiarities.|Albrecht Kossel|''[[The New York Times]] interview''<ref name="NYT_19110827"/>}}

Kossel was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1910 for his research in [[cell biology]], the chemical composition of the [[cell nucleus]], and for his work in isolating and describing [[nucleic acid]]s. The award was presented on 10 December 1910.<ref name="Britannica"/>

In the autumn of 1911, Kossel was invited to the United States to deliver the [[Christian Archibald Herter (physician)#The Christian A. Herter Lectures|Herter Lecture]] at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]]. Traveling with his wife Luise and daughter Gertrude, he took the opportunity to travel and to visit acquaintances, one of which was [[Eugene W. Hilgard]], [[professor emeritus]] of [[agricultural chemistry]] at the [[University of California at Berkeley]], who was also his wife's cousin. He also visited and delivered lectures at several other universities, including the [[University of Chicago]].<ref name="Yale_Jones_1953"/>

On the occasion of his visit to New York City, Kossel was interviewed by a reporter from ''[[The New York Times]]''. Kossel's English was reportedly very good, and his self-effacing modesty is voluminously mentioned in the reporter's account.<ref name="NYT_19110827"/>

His Herter lecture at Johns Hopkins was titled, "The Proteins". This was the only time Kossel ever visited the United States.<ref name="Yale_Jones_1953"/>

==Later research and collaboration==
With his distinguished English pupil [[Henry Drysdale Dakin]], Kossel investigated [[arginase]], the [[Enzyme#Etymology_and_history|ferment]] which hydrolyses [[arginine]] into [[urea]] and [[ornithine]]. Later, he discovered [[agmatine]] in herring roe and devised a method for preparing it.<ref name="Britannica"/>

Another of Kossel's students was American [[biochemistry|biochemist]] [[Edwin B. Hart]], who would later return to the United States to participate in the "[[Single-grain experiment]]" (1907–1911) and be part of research teams that would determine the [[nutrition|nutritive]] causes of [[anemia]] and [[Goitre|goiter]]. Another was [[Otto Folin]], an American chemist who discovered [[Phosphocreatine]].

In 1923, Kossel was honored by being named Germany's representative to the Eleventh Physiological Congress in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland. When he appeared before the assembled scientists, they gave him an ovation that lasted several minutes. At the congress, he was conferred an honorary degree by the [[University of Edinburgh]].<ref name="Yale_Jones_1953"/>

In 1924, Kossel became [[professor emeritus]], but continued to lecture at [[Heidelberg University]]. In April 1927, he attended the [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Lister]] Centenary Celebration held in England.<ref name="Yale_Jones_1953"/>

During the last years of Kossel's life, he conducted important research into the composition of the protein types [[protamines]] and [[histones]], and introduced [[flavianic acid]]  for the quantitative separation of arginine, histidine and lysine in proteins.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kossel, A. and R. E. Gross|date=1924|title=Über die Darstellung und quantitative Bestimmung des Arginins|journal=Hoppe-Seyler's Zeitschrift für physiologische Chemie|volume=135|issue=1–4|pages=167–174|doi=10.1515/bchm2.1924.135.1-4.167}}</ref>  A  monograph describing this work was published shortly after his death.<ref name="Yale_Jones_1953"/>

==Zeitschrift für Physiologische Chemie==
Kossel contributed to early issues of the [[Biological Chemistry (journal)|Zeitschrift für Physiologische Chemie]] (Journal of Physiological Chemistry). This publication was founded by his professor and mentor, [[Felix Hoppe-Seyler]], in 1877, the same year that Kossel started work as his research assistant. After Hoppe-Seyler's death in 1895, Kossel took over editorship of the Zeitschrift and continued in that role until his own death in 1927.<ref name="Yale_Jones_1953"/>

==Personal life==
[[File:Kossel grab.JPG|thumb|Kossel's grave in [[Heidelberg]]]]
In 1886, Kossel married Luise Holtzman, daughter of [[Adolf Holtzmann]]. Holtzmann was Professor at the [[University of Heidelberg]], lecturing in [[German literature]] as well as [[Sanskrit]]. He was also a noted [[philologist]] of his day. The couple had three children, two of whom survived to maturity: Walther, born in 1888, and daughter Gertrude, born in 1889.<ref name="Yale_Jones_1953"/>

Son [[Walther Kossel]] (1888–1956) became a prominent [[physicist]] and was professor of [[theoretical physics]] and director of the Physics Institute at the [[University of Tübingen]]. He is known for his theory of the [[chemical bond]] ([[ionic bond]]/[[octet rule]]), the [[Sommerfeld–Kossel displacement law]], and other achievements.

Albrecht Kossel was apparently not greatly interested in politics, but in 1914 he did not sign the propaganda Pronunciamento of German professors at the start of the war. He suffered under the lies which filled the world in war time. In 1917 Kossel was summoned by the government to pronounce that the allotted food provisions were sufficient. He refused this demand, would never declare untruths as truths<ref name="Yale_Jones_1953"/>

Through his marriage to Luise, Kossel was related to several prominent Americans, including [[Pedology|soil science]] pioneer [[Eugene W. Hilgard]], journalist and financier [[Henry Villard]], and abolitionist [[William Lloyd Garrison]].<ref name="Yale_Jones_1953"/>

Luise Kossel died in 1913 of [[acute pancreatitis]]. Kossel died quietly on 5 July 1927, after a recurring attack of [[angina pectoris]].<ref name="Yale_Jones_1953"/> He is buried in [[Heidelberg]], Germany.

==Legacy==
{{quote|The study of the living organism has more and more led to the view that its smallest independent units morphologically speaking – the cells – also to a certain degree lead an independent life and are the real seats of the vital processes. The cells therefore attract special attention in biological research, and studies which widen our knowledge of the cells to any important extent deserve to be given prominence.

Prof. Kossel has chosen to devote himself to this field of research, and it is for his work in this respect that the Nobel Prize has been awarded to him this year.|Nobel Prize Introduction Speech|December 10, 1910<ref name="NobelBio"/>}}

Albrecht Kossel is considered one of the great scientists of biochemistry and genetics.<ref name="Yale_Jones_1953"/> By isolating and defining [[nucleic acid]] and the [[nucleobases]], he provided the necessary precursors that led to the [[Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids|double-helix model]] of [[DNA]], devised by [[James D. Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] in 1953.<ref name="Britannica"/>

" … his elucidation of the chemical nature of some building blocks that make up nucleic acids and chromatine has secured immortality for this exeedingly modest and almost shy man."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lagerkvist|first=Ulf|title=DNA Pioneers and Their Legacy|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1998|location=New Haven and London|pages=73}}</ref>
