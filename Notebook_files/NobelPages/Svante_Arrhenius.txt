Originally a [[physicist]], but often referred to as a [[chemist]], Arrhenius was one of the founders of the science of [[physical chemistry]]. He received the [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]] in 1903, becoming the first [[Sweden|Swedish]] Nobel laureate. In 1905, he became director of the Nobel Institute, where he remained until his death.<ref name=Chambers>"Arrhenius, Svante August" in ''[[Chambers's Encyclopædia]]''.

Arrhenius was the first to use principles of [[physical chemistry]] to estimate the extent to which increases in atmospheric [[carbon dioxide]] are responsible for the Earth's increasing surface temperature. In the 1960s, [[Charles David Keeling]] demonstrated that the quantity of human-caused carbon dioxide emissions into the air is enough to cause [[global warming]].<ref name="Baum">{{cite journal|last1=Baum, Sr.|first1=Rudy M.|title=Future Calculations: The first climate change believer|journal=Distillations|date=2016|volume=2|issue=2 |pages=38–39 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/future-calculations|access-date=22 March 2018}}</ref>

==Biography==

===Early years===
Arrhenius was born on 19 February 1859 at [[Vik Castle|Vik]] (also spelled Wik or Wijk), near [[Uppsala]], [[Kingdom of Sweden]], [[Union between Sweden and Norway|United Kingdoms of Sweden and Norway]], the son of Svante Gustav and Carolina Thunberg Arrhenius. His father had been a [[surveying|land surveyor]] for [[Uppsala University]], moving up to a supervisory position. At the age of three, Arrhenius taught himself to read without the encouragement of his parents, and by watching his father's addition of numbers in his account books, became an [[arithmetic]]al [[child prodigy|prodigy]]. In later life, Arrhenius was profoundly passionate about mathematical concepts, data analysis and discovering their relationships and laws.

At age eight, he entered the local cathedral school, starting in the [[fifth grade]], distinguishing himself in [[physics]] and [[mathematics]], and graduating as the youngest and most able student in 1876.

===Ionic disassociation===
At the University of Uppsala, he was dissatisfied with the chief instructor of physics and the only faculty member who could have supervised him in chemistry, [[Per Teodor Cleve]], so he left to study at the Physical Institute of the Swedish Academy of Sciences in [[Stockholm]] under the physicist [[Erik Edlund]] in 1881.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

His work focused on the [[Conductivity (electrolytic)|conductivities]] of [[electrolyte]]s. In 1884, based on this work, he submitted a 150-page dissertation on electrolytic conductivity to Uppsala for the [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]]. It did not impress the professors, among whom was Cleve, and he received a fourth-class degree, but upon his defense it was reclassified as third-class. Later, extensions of this very work would earn him the [[List of Nobel laureates in Chemistry|1903 Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1903/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1903|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=18 March 2018}}</ref>

Arrhenius put forth 56 theses in his 1884 dissertation, most of which would still be accepted today unchanged or with minor modifications. The most important idea in the dissertation was his explanation of the fact that solid crystalline salts disassociate into paired charged particles when dissolved, for which he would win the 1903 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Arrhenius's explanation was that in forming a [[Solution (chemistry)|solution]], the salt disassociates into charged particles, to which [[Michael Faraday]] had given the name [[ion]]s many years earlier. Faraday's belief had been that ions were produced in the process of [[electrolysis]], that is, an external direct current source of electricity was necessary to form ions. Arrhenius proposed that, even in the absence of an electric current, [[aqueous solution]]s of salts contained ions.
He thus proposed that chemical reactions in solution were reactions between ions.<ref name="columbia">{{cite book|editor1-last=Harris|editor1-first=William|editor2-last=Levey|editor2-first=Judith|title=The New Columbia Encyclopedia|date=1975|publisher=Columbia University|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-231035-729|page=[https://archive.org/details/newcolumbiaencyc00harr/page/155 155]|edition=4th|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/newcolumbiaencyc00harr/page/155}}</ref><ref name="EncBrit">{{cite book|editor1-last=McHenry|editor1-first=Charles|title=The New Encyclopædia Britannica|date=1992|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.|location=Chicago|isbn=978-085-229553-3|page=587|volume=1|edition=15}}</ref><ref name="SciBio">{{cite book|editor1-last=Cillispie|editor1-first=Charles|title=Dictionary of Scientific Biography|date=1970|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-684101-125|pages=296–302|edition=1}}</ref>

The dissertation did not impress the professors at Uppsala, but Arrhenius sent it to a number of scientists in Europe who were developing the new science of [[physical chemistry]], such as [[Rudolf Clausius]], [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], and [[J. H. van 't Hoff]]. 
They were far more impressed, and Ostwald even came to Uppsala to persuade Arrhenius to join his research team. Arrhenius declined, however, as he preferred to stay in Sweden-Norway for a while (his father was very ill and would die in 1885) and had received an appointment at Uppsala.<ref name="columbia"/><ref name="EncBrit"/><ref name="SciBio"/>

In an extension of his [[ion|ionic theory]] Arrhenius proposed definitions for [[acid]]s and [[Base (chemistry)|bases]], in 1884. He believed that acids were substances that produce [[hydrogen ions]] in solution and that bases were substances that produce [[hydroxide]] ions in solution.

===Middle period===
[[File:Arrhenius, Svante August – Lehrbuch der kosmischen Physik, 1903 – BEIC 6781113.jpg|thumb|''Lehrbuch der kosmischen Physik'', 1903]]

In 1885, Arrhenius next received a travel grant from the Swedish Academy of Sciences, which enabled him to study with Ostwald in [[Riga]] (now in [[Latvia]]), with [[Friedrich Kohlrausch (physicist)|Friedrich Kohlrausch]] in [[Würzburg]], [[Germany]], with [[Ludwig Boltzmann]] in [[Graz, Austria]], and with van 't Hoff in [[Amsterdam]].

In 1889, Arrhenius explained the fact that most reactions require added heat energy to proceed by formulating the concept of [[activation energy]], an energy barrier that must be overcome before two molecules will react. The [[Arrhenius equation]] gives the quantitative basis of the relationship between the activation energy and the rate at which a reaction proceeds.

In 1891, he became a lecturer at the Stockholm University College (''Stockholms Högskola'', now [[Stockholm University]]), being promoted to professor of physics (with much opposition) in 1895, and [[Rector (academia)|rector]] in 1896.

===Nobel Prizes===
About 1900, Arrhenius became involved in setting up the Nobel Institutes and the [[Nobel Prize]]s. He was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1901. For the rest of his life, he would be a member of the [[Nobel Committee]] on Physics and a de facto member of the Nobel Committee on Chemistry.  He used his positions to arrange prizes for his friends ([[Jacobus van't Hoff]], [[Wilhelm Ostwald]], [[Theodore William Richards|Theodore Richards]]) and to attempt to deny them to his enemies ([[Paul Ehrlich]], [[Walther Nernst]], [[Dmitri Mendeleev]]).<ref>Patrick Coffey, Cathedrals of Science: ''The Personalities and Rivalries That Made Modern Chemistry'', Oxford University Press, 2008,</ref> In 1901 Arrhenius was elected to the Swedish Academy of Sciences, against strong opposition. In 1903 he became the first Swede to be awarded the [[Nobel Prize in chemistry|Nobel Prize in Chemistry]]. 
In 1905, upon the founding of the Nobel Institute for Physical Research at Stockholm, he was appointed [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the institute, the position where he remained until retirement in 1927.

In 1911, he won the first Willard Gibbs Award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicagoacs.org/content.php?page=Willard_Gibbs_Award|title=Willard Gibbs Award|website=chicagoacs.org|access-date=18 March 2018}}</ref>

===Later years===
[[Image:Arrhenius family grave.jpg|thumb|Arrhenius family grave in [[Uppsala]]]]
Eventually, Arrhenius's theories became generally accepted and he turned to other scientific topics. In 1902, he began to investigate [[physiology|physiological]] problems in terms of chemical theory. He determined that reactions in living organisms and in the test tube followed the same laws.

In 1904, he delivered at the [[University of California]] a course of lectures, the object of which was to illustrate the application of the methods of physical chemistry to the study of the theory of [[toxins]] and [[antitoxins]], and which were published in 1907 under the title ''Immunochemistry''.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924000273718|title=Immunochemistry; the application of the principles of physical chemistry to the study of the biological antibodies|date=1907|author=Svante Arrhenius|publisher=The Macmillan Company}}</ref>
He also turned his attention to [[geology]] (the origin of [[ice age]]s), [[astronomy]], [[physical cosmology]], and [[astrophysics]], accounting for the birth of the [[Solar System]] by interstellar collision. 
He considered [[radiation pressure]] as accounting for [[comet]]s, the [[solar corona]], the [[aurora borealis]], and [[zodiacal light]].

He thought life might have been carried from planet to planet by the transport of [[spore]]s, the theory now known as [[panspermia]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}<ref>Arrhenius, S., ''Worlds in the Making: The Evolution of the Universe''. New York, Harper & Row, 1908,</ref> He thought of the idea of a [[universal language]], proposing a modification of the [[English language]].

He was a board member for the ''Swedish Society for Racial Hygiene'' (founded 1909), which endorsed [[mendelism]] at the time, and contributed to the topic of contraceptives around 1910. However, until 1938 information and sale of contraceptives was prohibited in the Kingdom of Sweden. [[Gordon Stein]] wrote that Svante Arrhenius was an atheist.<ref>{{cite book|title=The encyclopedia of unbelief|volume=1|date=1988|publisher=Prometheus Books|isbn=9780879753078|author=Gordon Stein|page=594|quote=Svante Arrhenius (I859-I927), recipient of the Nobel Prize in chemistry (I903), was a declared atheist and the author of The Evolution of the Worlds and other works on cosmic physics.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Svante Arrhenius|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/875/000092599/|publisher=Soylent Communications|access-date=11 September 2012|author=NNDB.com}}</ref> In his last years he wrote both textbooks and popular books, trying to emphasize the need for further work on the topics he discussed. In September 1927, he came down with an attack of acute [[intestine|intestinal]] [[catarrh]] and died on 2 October. He was buried in Uppsala.

==Marriages and family==
He was married twice, first to his former pupil Sofia Rudbeck (1894 to 1896), with whom he had one son, {{ill|Olof Arrhenius|sv||fr|Olof Vilhelm Arrhenius}}, and then to Maria Johansson (1905 to 1927), with whom he had two daughters and a son.

Arrhenius was the grandfather of bacteriologist [[Agnes Wold]],<ref>[http://fof.se/tidning/2011/2/mot-bacillskrack-och-gubbvalde Mot bacillskräck och gubbvälde], 1 February 2011</ref> chemist {{ill|Svante Wold|sv|Svante Wold}},<ref>{{cite web |title=Svante Wold |url=https://www.umu.se/personal/svante-wold/ |website=www.umu.se |language=sv}}</ref> and [[Oceanography|ocean]] [[Biogeochemistry|biogeochemist]] {{ill|Gustaf Arrhenius|sv||fr|Gustaf Olof Svante Arrhenius}}.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Arrhenius |first1=O. |title=Statistical Investigations in the Constitution of Plant Associations |journal=Ecology |date=January 1923 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=68–73 |doi=10.2307/1929275|jstor=1929275 }}</ref>

==Greenhouse effect==

In developing a theory to explain the [[ice age]]s, Arrhenius, in 1896, was the first to use basic principles of physical chemistry to calculate estimates of the extent to which increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) will increase Earth's surface temperature through the [[greenhouse effect]].<ref name="Baum"/><ref name=CarbonicAcid>{{cite journal |last1=Arrhenius |first1=Svante |title=On the influence of carbonic acid in the air upon the temperature of the ground |journal=The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science |date=1896 |volume=41 |issue=251 |pages=237–276 |doi=10.1080/14786449608620846|url=http://www.rsc.org/images/Arrhenius1896_tcm18-173546.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Arrhenius |first1=Svante|title=On the Influence of Carbonic Acid in the Air Upon the Temperature of the Ground|journal=Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific|year=1897|pages=14|volume=9|issue=54|bibcode = 1897PASP....9...14A |doi = 10.1086/121158 |doi-access=free}}</ref> These calculations led him to conclude that human-caused CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, from fossil-fuel burning and other combustion processes, are large enough to cause global warming. This conclusion has been extensively tested, winning a place at the core of modern climate science.<ref>[https://www.skepticalscience.com/empirical-evidence-for-co2-enhanced-greenhouse-effect.htm "How do we know more CO2 is causing global warming?"], ''Skeptical Science'', founded by John Cook, the Climate Communication Fellow for the Global Change Institute, University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia</ref><ref>[https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf "Climate Change 2013 – The Physical Science Basis, by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)"], IPCC, 2013: Summary for Policymakers.

Plattner, M. Tignor, S.K. Allen, J. Boschung, A. Nauels, Y. Xia, V. Bex and P.M. Midgley (eds.)]. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, England and New York, NY.</ref> Arrhenius, in this work, built upon the prior work of other famous scientists, including [[Joseph Fourier]], [[John Tyndall]] and [[Claude Pouillet]]. Arrhenius wanted to determine whether greenhouse gases could contribute to the explanation of the temperature variation between glacial and inter-glacial periods.<ref>Rodhe, Henning, et al. "Svante Arrhenius and the Greenhouse Effect". Ambio, vol. 26, no. 1, 1997, pp. 2–5. {{JSTOR|4314542}}.</ref> Arrhenius used infrared observations of the moon – by [[Frank Washington Very]] and [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]] at the [[Allegheny Observatory]] in [[Pittsburgh]] – to calculate how much of infrared (heat) radiation is captured by CO<sub>2</sub> and water (H<sub>2</sub>O) vapour in Earth's atmosphere. Using 'Stefan's law' (better known as the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law]]), he formulated what he referred to as a 'rule'. 
In its original form, Arrhenius's rule reads as follows:
::''if the quantity of carbonic acid increases in geometric progression, the augmentation of the temperature will increase nearly in arithmetic progression.''
Here, Arrhenius refers to CO<sub>2</sub> as carbonic acid (which refers only to the aqueous form H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> in modern usage). The following formulation of Arrhenius's rule is still in use today:<ref name=Walter>Martin E.

::<math>\Delta F = \alpha \ln(C/C_0)</math>

where <math>C_0</math> is the concentration of CO<sub>2</sub> at the beginning (time-zero) of the period being studied (if the same concentration unit is used for both <math>C</math> and <math>C_0</math>, then it doesn't matter which concentration unit is used); <math>C</math> is the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration at end of the period being studied; ''ln'' is the natural logarithm (= log base e ({{nowrap|log<sub>''e''</sub>}})); and <math>\Delta F</math> is the augmentation of the temperature, in other words the change in the rate of heating Earth's surface ([[radiative forcing]]), which is measured in [[Watt]]s per square [[meter]].<ref name=Walter /> Derivations from atmospheric radiative transfer models have found that <math>\alpha </math> (alpha) for CO<sub>2</sub> is 5.35 (± 10%) W/m<sup>2</sup> for Earth's atmosphere.<ref>[http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/aggi/aggi.html "NOAA Annual Greenhouse Gas Index, Spring 2016"], NOAA Annual Greenhouse Gas Index, NOAA Earth System Research Laboratory, Boulder, CO, James H Butler and Stephen A Montzka</ref>
[[File:Solvay conference, 1922.jpg|thumb|Arrhenius at the first Solvay conference on chemistry in 1922 in [[Brussels]].]]

Based on information from his colleague [[Arvid Högbom]], Arrhenius was the first person to predict that emissions of carbon dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels and other combustion processes were large enough to cause global warming. In his calculation Arrhenius included the feedback from changes in water vapor as well as latitudinal effects, but he omitted clouds, convection of heat upward in the atmosphere, and other essential factors. His work is currently seen less as an accurate quantification of global warming than as the first demonstration that increases in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> will cause global warming, everything else being equal.
[[File:Svante Arrhenius 01.jpg|thumb|Svante Arrhenius (1909)]]
Arrhenius's absorption values for CO<sub>2</sub> and his conclusions met criticism by [[Knut Ångström]] in 1900, who published the first modern infrared absorption spectrum of CO<sub>2</sub> with two absorption bands, and published experimental results that seemed to show that absorption of infrared radiation by the gas in the atmosphere was already "saturated" so that adding more could make no difference. Arrhenius replied strongly in 1901 (''Annalen der Physik''), dismissing the critique altogether. He touched on the subject briefly in a technical book titled ''Lehrbuch der kosmischen Physik'' (1903). He later wrote ''Världarnas utveckling'' (1906) (German: ''Das Werden der Welten'' [1907], English: [https://archive.org/details/worldsinmakinge01arrhgoog ''Worlds in the Making''] [1908]) directed at a general audience, where he suggested that the human emission of CO<sub>2</sub> would be strong enough to prevent the world from entering a new ice age, and that a warmer earth would be needed to feed the rapidly increasing population:

:: "To a certain extent the temperature of the earth's surface, as we shall presently see, is conditioned by the properties of the atmosphere surrounding it, and particularly by the permeability of the latter for the rays of heat." (p. 46)

:: "That the atmospheric envelopes limit the heat losses from the planets had been suggested about 1800 by the great French physicist Fourier. His ideas were further developed afterwards by Pouillet and Tyndall. Their theory has been styled the hot-house theory, because they thought that the atmosphere acted after the manner of the glass panes of hot-houses." (p. 51)

:: "If the quantity of carbonic acid [ CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O '''→''' H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> (carbonic acid) ] in the air should sink to one-half its present percentage, the temperature would fall by about 4°; a diminution to one-quarter would reduce the temperature by 8°. On the other hand, any doubling of the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air would raise the temperature of the earth's surface by 4°; and if the carbon dioxide were increased fourfold, the temperature would rise by 8°." (p. 53)

:: "Although the sea, by absorbing carbonic acid, acts as a regulator of huge capacity, which takes up about five-sixths of the produced carbonic acid, we yet recognize that the slight percentage of carbonic acid in the atmosphere may by the advances of industry be changed to a noticeable degree in the course of a few centuries." (p. 54)

:: "Since, now, warm ages have alternated with glacial periods, even after man appeared on the earth, we have to ask ourselves: Is it probable that we shall in the coming geological ages be visited by a new ice period that will drive us from our temperate countries into the hotter climates of Africa? There does not appear to be much ground for such an apprehension. The enormous combustion of coal by our industrial establishments suffices to increase the percentage of carbon dioxide in the air to a perceptible degree." (p. 61)

:: "We often hear lamentations that the coal stored up in the earth is wasted by the present generation without any thought of the future, and we are terrified by the awful destruction of life and property which has followed the volcanic eruptions of our days. We may find a kind of consolation in the consideration that here, as in every other case, there is good mixed with the evil. By the influence of the increasing percentage of carbonic acid in the atmosphere, we may hope to enjoy ages with more equable and better climates, especially as regards the colder regions of the earth, ages when the earth will bring forth much more abundant crops than at present, for the benefit of rapidly propagating mankind." (p. 63)

At this time, the accepted consensus explanation is that, historically, [[orbital forcing]] has set the timing for ice ages, with CO<sub>2</sub> acting as an essential [[positive feedback|amplifying feedback]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scripps.ucsd.edu/programs/keelingcurve/2014/06/20/how-do-co2-levels-relate-to-ice-ages-and-sea-level/|title=How do CO2 levels relate to ice ages and sea-level?|last=Monroe|first=Rob|date=2014-06-20|website=The Keeling Curve|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ganopolski |first1=A. |last2=Calov |first2=R. |title=The role of orbital forcing, carbon dioxide and regolith in 100 kyr glacial cycles |journal=Climate of the Past |date=2011 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=1415–1425 |doi=10.5194/cp-7-1415-2011|bibcode=2011CliPa...7.1415G |url=http://www.clim-past.net/7/1415/2011/cp-7-1415-2011.pdf|doi-access=free }}</ref> However, CO<sub>2</sub> releases since the industrial revolution have increased CO<sub>2</sub> to a level not found since 10 to 15 million years ago, when the global average surface temperature was up to {{convert|11|F-change|0}} warmer than now and almost all ice had melted, raising world sea-levels to about 100 feet higher than today's.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.climatecentral.org/news/the-last-time-co2-was-this-high-humans-didnt-exist-15938|title=The Last Time CO2 Was This High, Humans Didn't Exist|last=Andrew Freedman|website=www.climatecentral.org|language=en|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>

Arrhenius estimated based on the CO<sub>2</sub> levels at his time, that reducing levels by 0.62–0.55 would decrease temperatures by 4–5&nbsp;°C (Celsius) and an increase of 2.5 to 3 times of CO<sub>2</sub> would cause a temperature rise of 8–9&nbsp;°C in the Arctic.<ref name=CarbonicAcid /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Graham |first1=Steve |title=Svante Arrhenius : Arrhenius' Carbon Dioxide Research |url=https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Arrhenius/arrhenius_2.php |publisher=Nasa Earth Observatory |language=en |date=18 January 2000}}</ref> In his book ''Worlds in the Making'' he described the "hot-house" theory of the atmosphere.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Graham |first1=Steve |title=Svante Arrhenius : Hot House Theory |url=https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/features/Arrhenius/arrhenius_3.php |publisher=Nasa Earth Observatory |language=en |date=18 January 2000}}</ref>
