== Early life ==
Martin Karplus was born in Vienna, Austria.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2013|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2013/karplus/facts/|access-date=2021-01-18|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US}}</ref> He was a child when his family fled from the [[Nazi]]-occupation in Austria a few days after the [[Anschluss]] in March 1938, spending several months in Zürich, Switzerland and La Baule, France before immigrating to the United States.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Karplus|first=M|year=2006|title=Spinach on the ceiling: a theoretical chemist's return to biology.|journal=Annual Review of Biophysics and Biomolecular Structure|volume=35|pages=1–47|doi=10.1146/annurev.biophys.33.110502.133350|pmid=16689626|doi-access=free}}</ref>  Prior to their immigration to the United States, the family was known for being "an intellectual and successful secular [[Jewish]] family" in Vienna.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fuller|first=Robert|title=A Love of Discovery: Science Education - The Second Career of Robert Karplus|publisher=Kluwer Academic|year=2002|isbn=0-306-46687-2|location=New York|page=293}}</ref> His grandfather, [[:de:Johann Paul Karplus|Johann Paul Karplus]] (1866-1936) was a highly acclaimed professor of psychiatry at the University of Vienna.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gaugusch|first=Georg|url=http://www.jewishfamilies.at/index.html|title=Wer einmal war: Das jüdische Großbürgertum Wiens 1800-1938 A-K|publisher=Amalthea Signum|year=2011|isbn=978-3850027502|location=Wien|pages=1358–1367}}</ref> His great-aunt, [[Eugenie Goldstern]], was an ethnologist who was killed during the Holocaust.<ref name="Harvard Gazette film">{{cite journal|last1=Ireland|first1=Corydon|date=June 3, 2015|title=Karplus on film|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/06/karplus-on-film/|journal=The Harvard Gazette|access-date=26 March 2019}}</ref> He is the nephew, by marriage, of the sociologist, philosopher and musicologist [[Theodor W. Adorno]] and grandnephew of the physicist [[Robert von Lieben]]. His brother, [[Robert Karplus]], was an internationally recognized physicist and educator at [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Continuing with the [[academic]] family theme, his nephew, [[Andrew Karplus]], is a highly respected [[biochemistry]] and [[biophysics]] professor at [[Oregon State University]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Splichalova|first=Dacotah-Victoria|title=Diamond in the rough: Karplus wins lifetime achievement award|url=http://www.orangemedianetwork.com/daily_barometer/news/diamond-in-the-rough-karplus-wins-lifetime-achievement-award/article_08a9060e-2281-51f1-9671-846be904b488.html|access-date=2020-04-24|website=Orange Media Network|language=en}}</ref>

== Teaching career ==
Karplus taught at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]] (1955–60) and then [[Columbia University]] (1960–65) before moving to chemistry faculty at Harvard in 1966.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" /> 

He was a professor at the  [[Louis Pasteur University]] in 1996 where he established a research group in Strasbourg, France, after two sabbatical visits between 1992 and 1995 in the NMR laboratory of Jean-François Lefèvre. He has supervised more than 200 graduate students and postdoctoral researchers over his career since 1955.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Martin Karplus – www.americanbiophysicists.com|url=http://americanbiophysicists.com/martin-karplus/|access-date=2021-01-18|language=en-US}}</ref>  

==Research==
He published his first academic paper when he was 17 years old.<ref name=":1" />  Karplus has contributed to many fields in physical chemistry, including chemical dynamics, [[quantum chemistry]], and most notably, [[molecular dynamics]] simulations of [[biomolecule|biological macromolecules]]. He has also been influential in [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]], particularly to the understanding of [[J-coupling|nuclear spin-spin coupling]] and [[electron spin resonance spectroscopy]]. The [[Karplus equation]] describing the correlation between [[coupling constant]]s and [[dihedral angles]] in [[proton nuclear magnetic resonance]] spectroscopy is named after him.

In 1970 postdoctoral fellow [[Arieh Warshel]] joined Karplus at Harvard. Together they wrote a computer program that modeled the atomic nuclei and some electrons of a molecule using classical physics and modeling other electrons using [[quantum mechanics]]. In 1974 Karplus, Washel and other collaborators published a paper based on this type of modeling which successfully modeled the change in shape of retinal, a large complex protein molecule important to vision.<ref name=":2" />

His current research is concerned primarily with the properties of molecules of biological interest. His group originated and coordinated the development of the [[CHARMM]] program for [[molecular dynamics]] simulations.
