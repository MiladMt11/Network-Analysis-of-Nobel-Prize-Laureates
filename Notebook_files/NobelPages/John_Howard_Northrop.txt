'''John Howard Northrop''' (July 5, 1891 – May 27, 1987) was an American [[biochemist]] who, with [[James Batcheller Sumner]] and [[Wendell Meredith Stanley]], won the 1946 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].  The award was given for these scientists' isolation, [[crystallization]], and study of [[enzyme]]s, proteins, and viruses.<ref>{{cite web | title = The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1946 - Preparing Pure Proteins | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1946/speedread.html | access-date = 2008-12-14}}</ref> Northrop was a Professor of Bacteriology and Medical Physics, Emeritus, at [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=hb967nb5k3&doc.view=frames&chunk.id=div00041&toc.depth=1&toc.id=|title = University of California: In Memoriam, 1988}}</ref>

==Biography==

===Early years===
Northrop was born in [[Yonkers, New York]] to [[John Isaiah Northrop|John Isaiah]], a [[zoologist]] and instructor at Columbia University, and [[Alice Rich Northrop]], a teacher of botany at Hunter College. His father died in a lab explosion two weeks before John H. Northrop was born. The son was educated at [[Yonkers High School]] and [[Columbia University]], where he earned his PhD in chemistry in 1915. During [[World War I]], he conducted research for the [[Chemical Corps|U.S. Chemical Warfare Service]] on the production of [[acetone]] and [[ethanol]] through [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]]. This work led to studying enzymes.

===Research===
In 1929, Northrop isolated and crystallized the gastric enzyme [[pepsin]]<ref>{{Citation | author=Northrop, J. H. | title=Crystalline Pepsin |  journal=Science | year=1929 | volume=69 | page=580 | doi=10.1126/science.69.1796.580 | pmid=17758437 | issue=1796|bibcode = 1929Sci....69..580N }}</ref> and determined that it was a [[protein]]. In 1938 he isolated and crystallized the first [[bacteriophage]] (a small virus that attacks [[bacterium|bacteria]]), and determined that it was a [[nucleoprotein]]. Northrop also isolated and crystallized pepsinogen (the precursor to pepsin), [[trypsin]], [[chymotrypsin]], and [[carboxypeptidase]].

For his 1939 book, ''Crystalline Enzymes: The Chemistry of Pepsin, Trypsin, and Bacteriophage'', Northrop was awarded the [[Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal]] from the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]].<ref name=Elliot>{{cite web|title=Daniel Giraud Elliot Medal |url=http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_elliot |publisher=National Academy of Sciences |access-date=16 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229194403/http://www.nasonline.org/site/PageServer?pagename=AWARDS_elliot |archive-date=29 December 2010 }}</ref> He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1949.<ref name=AAAS>{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter N|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterN.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|access-date=15 April 2011}}</ref> Northrop was employed by the [[Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research]] in New York City from 1916 until his retirement in 1961. In 1949 he joined the [[University of California, Berkeley]] as Professor of Bacteriology, and later, he was appointed Professor of Biophysics.<ref>{{cite web|title=John H.

===Personal life===

In 1917, Northrop married Louise Walker (1891-1975), with whom he had two children: John, an oceanographer, and Alice, who married Nobel laureate [[Frederick C. Robbins]]. The family lived in a small home just outside of Mt. Vernon, New York. As their children grew older and Northrop looked for a more desirable workplace, the family bought a home in Cotuit, Massachusetts. This move shortened Northrop's commute to the laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey, and also put him in closer contact with the wilderness which he greatly enjoyed.<ref>{{Cite book|date=1994-01-01|title=Biographical Memoirs|url=http://www.nap.edu/read/4560/chapter/20#447|language=en|doi=10.17226/4560|isbn=978-0-309-04976-4}}</ref>  Northrop committed suicide in [[Wickenburg, Arizona]] in 1987.<ref>See p. 440 of {{Citation | last = Herriott | first = R.
