Professor '''Paul Karrer''' [[Royal Society of London|FRS]] [[FRSE]] FCS (21 April 1889 – 18 June 1971) was a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[organic chemist]] best known for his research on [[vitamin]]s.  He and [[Norman Haworth]] won the [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]] in 1937.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Karrer was born in [[Moscow]], [[Russia]] to Paul Karrer and Julie Lerch, both Swiss nationals. In 1892 Karrer's family returned to [[Switzerland]] where he was educated at [[Wildegg]] and at the [[grammar school]] in [[Lenzburg]], [[Aarau]], where he matriculated in 1908. He studied [[chemistry]] at the [[University of Zurich]] under [[Alfred Werner]] and after gaining his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1911, he spent a further year as assistant in the Chemical Institute. He then took a post as chemist with [[Paul Ehrlich]] at the [[Georg Speyer Haus]], [[Frankfurt-am-Main]]. In 1919 he became Professor of Chemistry and Director of the Chemical Institute.

===Research===
Karrer's early research concerned complex metal compounds but his most important work has concerned [[plant pigment]]s, particularly the yellow [[carotenoid]]s. He elucidated their chemical structure and showed that some of these substances are transformed in the body into [[vitamin A]]. His work led to the establishment of the correct constitutional formula for [[beta-carotene]], the chief precursor of vitamin A; the first time that the structure of a vitamin or provitamin had been established. [[George Wald]] worked briefly in Karrer's lab while studying the role of vitamin A in the [[retina]]. Later, Karrer confirmed the structure of [[ascorbic acid]] ([[vitamin C]]) and extended his researches into the vitamin B<sub>2</sub> and E. His important contributions to the chemistry of the [[Flavin group|flavins]] led to identification of [[lactoflavin]] as part of the complex originally thought to be [[vitamin B2|vitamin B<sub>2</sub>]].

Karrer published many papers, and received many honours and awards, including the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1937. His textbook ''Lehrbuch der Organischen Chemie (Textbook of Organic Chemistry)'' was published in 1927, went through thirteen editions, and was published in seven languages.

===Personal life===
Karrer was married to Helena Froelich in 1914 and had three sons, one of whom died in infancy.<ref>Isler, page 245</ref> He died on 18 June 1971, at the age of 82 in [[Zürich]]. His wife died in 1972.

==Legacy==
The prestigious [[Paul Karrer Gold Medal]] and lecture was established in his honour in 1959 by a group of leading companies such as CIBA AG, J.R. Geigy, F. Hoffmann-La Roche & Co. AG, Sandoz AG, Société des Produits Nestlé AG and Dr. A. Wander AG. It is awarded annually or biannually to an outstanding chemist who delivers a lecture at the [[University of Zurich]].<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.chem.uzh.ch/events/pastEvents/KarrerLecture.html|title = Paul Karrer Lecture|publisher = University of Zurich|access-date = 20 January 2015|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150120222321/http://www.chem.uzh.ch/events/pastEvents/KarrerLecture.html|archive-date = 20 January 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref>
