'''Óscar Arias  Sánchez''' ({{IPA-es|ˈoskaɾ ˈaɾjas}}; born 13 September 1940 in [[Heredia, Costa Rica]]) is a Costa Rican activist and [[Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Peace Prize laureate]]. He was [[President of Costa Rica]] from 1986 to 1990 and from 2006 to 2010. He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987 for his efforts to end the [[Central American crisis]].<ref>https://www.tse.go.cr/pdf/ifed/PresidentesCR-Cuadros.pdf</ref>
He was also a recipient of the [[Albert Schweitzer Prize for Humanitarianism]] and a trustee of [[Economists for Peace and Security]].  In 2003, he was elected to the board of directors of the [[International Criminal Court]]'s Trust Fund for Victims.<ref>[[Amnesty International]], 12 September 2003,{{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGIOR300072003?open&of=ENG-391 |title=''Amnesty International welcomes the election of a Board of Directors'' |access-date=2007-08-01 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060415130813/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGIOR300072003?open&of=ENG-391 |archive-date=15 April 2006 |df=dmy }}.

==Early life==
Arias was born within an upper-class family in the province of [[Heredia Province|Heredia]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150524080817/http://www.genealogia.or.cr/docs/revistas/accg_revista012.pdf] Academia Costarricense de Ciencias Genealógicas.{{in lang|es}} p.&nbsp;163</ref> Arias concluded his secondary schooling at the Saint Francis College in the capital city of [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]]. He then went to the United States and enrolled in [[Boston University]] with the intention of studying medicine, but he soon returned to his home country and completed degrees in law and economics at the [[University of Costa Rica]]. In 1967, Arias traveled to the United Kingdom and enrolled in the [[London School of Economics]]. He received a doctoral degree in political science from the [[University of Essex]] in 1974. Arias has received over fifty honorary degrees, including doctorates from [[Harvard University]], [[Princeton University]], [[Dartmouth College]], [[Oberlin College]], [[Wake Forest University]], [[Ithaca College]] and [[Washington University in St. Louis]].

==First presidency ==
[[File:OscarArias.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Arias in the 1980s]]
Arias joined the [[National Liberation Party (Costa Rica)|National Liberation Party]] (PLN), Costa Rica's main [[social democracy|social democratic]] party. In 1986 he ran successfully for president on that party's ticket. Arias's presidency saw the transformation of Costa Rica's economy from one based on the traditional [[cash crop]]s ([[coffee]] and [[banana]]s) to one more focused on non-traditional agriculture (e.g., of exotic flowers and [[fruit]]s) and [[tourism]]. Some within the PLN criticized his administration for abandoning the party's social democratic teachings and promoting a [[neoliberal]] economic model. He is now often regarded as a neoliberal although he is a member of a nominally social democratic party.<ref>"He is often identified as a'neoliberal' and accused of being in the service of the big capitalists of the country and the transnationals, in spite of his being a member of the National Liberation Party, which defines itself as socialdemocratic." [https://archive.today/20130126005851/http://www.heraldohn.com/Especiales/Honduras%20en%20contra%20de%20la%20ilegalidad%20del%2024%20de%20junio%20de%202009/Ediciones/2009/07/07/Noticias/Primera-reunion-Micheletti-Zelaya-tras-los-hechos-del-28-de-junio-sera-en-Costa-Rica "First Micheletti-Zelaya meeting since the events of 28 June will be in Costa Rica"] ''El Heraldo'' (6 July 2009). Original in Spanish.</ref>

Arias received the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize with the help of John Biehl, his peer in England, and Rodrigo Madrigal Nieto for his work towards the signing of the [[Esquipulas Peace Agreement|Esquipulas II Accords]]. This was a plan intended to promote [[democracy]] and peace on the Central American [[isthmus]] during a time of great turmoil: leftist guerrillas were fighting against the governments in [[Salvadoran Civil War|El Salvador]] and [[Guatemalan Civil War|Guatemala]], which were backed by the United States under the auspices of the [[Cold War]]; the [[Contras]], supported by the United States, were fighting an insurgency against the [[Sandinista]] government in [[Nicaragua]]; [[Honduras]], only recently wresting political power from its military, was caught in the middle as a base for U.S. military forces; and on Costa Rica's other border, [[Panama]] faced the oppression of [[Manuel Noriega]]'s military dictatorship. With the support of Arias, the various armed conflicts ended within the decade (Guatemala's civil war finally ended in 1996).

Arias then called for a higher level of integration in the Central America region and promoted the creation of the [[Central American Parliament]] (''Parlamento Centroamericano''). During his current administration, Arias has declared that Costa Rica will not enter the Central American Parliament.  Arias also modified the country's [[Education in Costa Rica|educational system]]. The most notable action in this respect was the reintroduction of standardized academic tests at the end of primary and secondary school.

==Second presidency==

[[File:Barack Obama and Óscar Arias Sánchez.jpg|thumb|Arias with [[Barack Obama]] on April 17, 2009]]
The Costa Rican constitution had been amended in 1969 to include a clause forbidding former presidents to seek re-election. Arias challenged this at the Sala IV, the Constitutional Chamber of the [[Supreme Court of Justice of Costa Rica]], which initially rejected his application in September 2000. In 2003, a group of Arias supporters presented an unconstitutionality challenge against the 1969 constitutional amendment forbidding re-election, and this time the ruling in April 2003 struck down the prohibition against non-consecutive re-election.<ref>[http://impreso.elnuevodiario.com.ni/2007/07/18/nacionales/54109 "Reeleccion seduce a los presidentes de America"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130913040137/http://impreso.elnuevodiario.com.ni/2007/07/18/nacionales/54109 |date=13 September 2013 }}, El Nuevo Diario, Managua, 18 July 2007, retrieved July 2009; [http://wvw.nacion.com/ln_ee/2003/abril/05/pais1.html "Reelecion presidencial: Arias sin prohobicion para postularse"], La Nacion, Costa Rica, 5 April 2003.</ref> This decision was denounced as a "state blow" or "coup d'état" by ex-president [[Luis Alberto Monge]].<ref>Luis Alberto Monge (20 March 2004).

Arias announced in 2004 that he intended to run again for president in the [[2006 Costa Rican presidential election|February 2006 general elections]].  By then, he was the only living former president who was not either in jail, under indictment or facing an investigation.  Though for years private polling companies and several news media published polls predicting Arias would win by a wide margin, the election was initially deemed too close to call. A month later, on 7 March, after a manual recount, the official results showed Arias beat center-left contender [[Ottón Solís]] by 18,169 votes (1.2% of valid votes cast), and finished just a few thousand votes over the 40 percent threshold required to capture the presidency in a single round. He took the oath of office at noon on 8 May 2006 at the [[Estadio Nacional de Costa Rica (1924)|National Stadium]]. In his speech on 15 September 2008, he admitted that he was tired because of the criticism of his opponents.

On 1 June 2007, he switched Costa Rica's diplomatic recognition from the [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan) to the [[People's Republic of China]], making Costa Rica the 167th nation in the world to do so. Subsequently, under diplomatic and financial pressure from Beijing, he induced the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]], a fellow [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate, to postpone indefinitely a proposed and much anticipated visit during Beijing's suppression of controversial riots in [[Tibet]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nacion.com/el-pais/grupo-tibetano-arias-pidio-al-dalai-lama-que-no-venga/GSTMB3JYYZEATI7FARCXBS444U/story|title = Grupo tibetano: Arias pidió al Dalái Lama que no venga}}</ref>

At the [[5th Summit of the Americas]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]], on 18 April 2009, Arias gave a speech on the topic "We've been doing something wrong". Directed at fellow Latin American leaders, he decried Latin America's lack of development compared to other parts of the world, calling for pragmatism, and more resources directed at education rather than militaries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2009/abril/26/opinion1944940.html |title=ALGO HICIMOS MAL: Palabras del presidente Óscar Arias en la Cumbre de las Américas |access-date=2009-04-29 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429101307/http://www.nacion.com/ln_ee/2009/abril/26/opinion1944940.html |archive-date=29 April 2009 |df=dmy }}.

===Mediator in 2009 Honduran Constitutional Crisis===
{{See also|2009 Honduran constitutional crisis|Roberto Micheletti#Presidency of Honduras}}

In 2009, the [[Supreme Court of Honduras]] issued an arrest warrant for Honduran President [[Manuel Zelaya]] because of violations of the constitution and laws.<ref>
On 12 November 2008, the Supreme Court of Justice determined that the modifications to articles 239 and 240 promulgated by Congress in 1998 and 2002 were unconstitutional and returned these two articles to their state in the 1982 constitution.

Zelaya fled to Costa Rica.  The Honduran constitution mandated that the head of Congress, [[Roberto Micheletti]], who was next in the presidential line of succession, becomes the provisional head of state since [[Vice President of Costa Rica|Vice President]] [[Elvin Ernesto Santos]] had resigned in December 2008 to run for president. Micheletti's term ended 27 January 2010.<ref>{{cite web

Arias began serving as mediator between Zelaya and Micheletti in the [[2009 Honduran constitutional crisis]]. Representatives of the two Hondurans met with Arias on various occasions but so far have failed to reach any kind of agreement.  As described above (with factual citations), Arias himself was initially prohibited by Costa Rica's constitutional court from another term, due to constitutional [[term limit]]s, but this was reversed using legal means, with the consent of the Costa Rican Sala IV court, unlike in Honduras. New elections in Honduras are planned for 29 November 2009. Micheletti's government stated on 2 July 2009 that it is willing to hold this year's presidential election early. Arias presented a seven-point agreement, which calls for the return of Zelaya as president – a condition deemed unacceptable to the interim government. Zelaya's representatives accepted the Arias proposal "in principle" but Micheletti's representatives balked at the key point of Zelaya returning to power in Honduras.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/honduras-negotiations-snag-over-unity-government-1.420590|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130101023331/http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20090728/honduras_leader_090728/20090728?hub=World&s_name=5|url-status=live|archive-date=1 January 2013|title=Honduras negotiations snag over unity government|publisher=CTV (Canada)|date=28 July 2009}}

==Health==
In August 2007, Arias was affected by [[tendinitis]], and in April 2008 he canceled some activities because of muscular pain in his [[lumbar region]]. Subsequently, due to increasing difficulty in speaking over the course of several weeks, Arias went to the Philadelphia [[Otolaryngology|Ears, Nose and Throat]] Associates medical center in the United States on 20 May 2008, where it was determined that he had a nonmalignant cyst on his vocal cords. As a result, it was announced on 21 May that doctors advised him not to speak for one month, saying that if this did not help, surgery would be considered.<ref>[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5ibQTnaBoqkeyR2ri72fnUV697YXgD90QGB400 "Doctors tell Costa Rican leader to rest voice"], Associated Press (22 May 2008).{{dead link|date=November 2012|bot=Legobot}}</ref> On 11 August 2009 Arias was diagnosed with [[H1N1]] Influenza, but he recovered.<ref>[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/08/12/internacional/1250034751.html "Presidente de Costa Rica contrae gripe AH1N1"], El Mundo (2009-08-12)</ref>

==Controversy==
Some Oscar Arias acts have generated controversy:
*In 2004, in response to a rival candidate (Antonio Álvarez) for his party's nomination challenging him to a debate, Oscar Arias said: "Eagles live in high places, and make a serious mistake if they go down to the mud to fight with snails."<ref>[http://www.nacion.com/el-pais/alvarez-reta-a-arias-a-discutir-plan-fiscal/TRK3KWZUKFGUZAAMD2PGZPZEX4/story/ "Álvarez reta a Arias a discutir plan fiscal"]. Nacion.com. Retrieved on 2018-01-05.</ref>
*In 2010, during the closing weeks of his second term, he inaugurated various unachieved projects with ribbon-cutting and bronze plaque ceremonies:
**The new National Stadium, despite the fact that it was only about 75% finished.<ref>[http://www.terra.com/deportes/noticias/china_exhibe_avance_de_75_en_construccion_de_estadio_nacional_de_costa_rica/fox1341634 "China exhibe avance de 75% en construcción de Estadio Nacional de Costa Rica"]. Terra.com. Retrieved on 2012-09-15.</ref>
**The "new presidential offices" despite the fact that these offices do not exist yet. In fact, the land is still for sale and the Legislative Assembly has allocated no funds yet in order to buy it, let alone build anything on the vacant lot.<ref>[http://www.nacion.com/2010-05-04/ElPais/UltimaHora/ElPais2359636.aspx "Arias develó placa de futura Casa Presidencial en un parqueo"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318184721/http://www.nacion.com/2010-05-04/ElPais/UltimaHora/ElPais2359636.aspx |date=18 March 2012 }}. Nacion.com (4 May 2010). Retrieved on 2012-09-15.</ref>
**The new Juan Santamaría International Airport installation, despite the fact the project was only 82% completed.<ref>[http://www.nacion.com/2010-04-29/ElPais/FotoVideoDestacado/ElPais2353065.aspx "Arias inaugura el Santamaría con 82% de avance en obras"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618114929/http://www.nacion.com/2010-04-29/ElPais/FotoVideoDestacado/ElPais2353065.aspx |date=18 June 2010 }}. Nacion.com (29 April 2010). Retrieved on 2012-09-15.</ref>

Further controversies followed him even after his role as a president had come to an end. The route from Escazú to Caldera built by the Spanish company Autopistas del Sol has undergone heavy criticism over the years for its high tolls and dangerous roads (which had to undergo heavy maintenance to prevent further rock slides). Oscar Arias was also blamed for having invited a Canadian corporation to perform heavy mining which could potentially compromise the local biodiversity. Their permissions were revoked during the Chinchilla Miranda administration which gave the impression of Arias-Chinchilla enmity following his sudden criticism of then president Laura Chinchilla Miranda who was popularly regarded as a successor.

==Judicial accusations==

In 2017 Costa Rica's General Attorney office indicted Arias for the Crucitas case, a case in which former Environment Minister Roberto Dobles and Arias as president signed a 2008 decree ceding the Canadian company Infinito Gold control over a protected area near the Nicaraguan border known as Crucitas for gold mining and declaring it "national interest",<ref name="robles">{{cite news |last1=Robles |first1=Francis |title=Former President of Costa Rica Is Accused of Sexual Assault |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/05/world/americas/oscar-arias-sanchez-sexual-assault.html |access-date=7 February 2019 |agency=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 February 2019}}</ref> something that the Prosecution argued was illegal as protected areas cannot be granted for exploitation of any kind. Dobles was previously found guilty of the charges, but Arias was not indicted alongside him by the previous General Attorney Jorge Chavarría (often accused of being close to Arias).<ref name="madrigal">{{cite news |last1=Madrial |first1=Luis |title=Caso Crucitas: Los eventos que llevaron a reabrir la causa contra Óscar Arias |url=https://www.elmundo.cr/caso-crucitas-los-eventos-llevaron-reabrir-la-causa-oscar-arias/ |access-date=7 February 2019 |agency=Mundo.cr |date=2 November 2017}}</ref> The new General Attorney Emilia Navas reopened the case indicting Arias.<ref name="madrigal" />

Also in 2019 psychiatrist and anti-Nuclear activist Alexandra Arce von Herold formally accused Arias of rape at the Public Ministry.
