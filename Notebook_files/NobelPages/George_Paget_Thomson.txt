==Education and early life==
Thomson was born in [[Cambridge]], England, the son of physicist and [[List of Nobel laureates in Physics|Nobel laureate]] [[J. J. Thomson]] and Rose Elisabeth Paget, daughter of [[George Edward Paget]]. Thomson went to [[The Perse School]], Cambridge before going on to read [[mathematics]] and [[physics]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], until the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, when he was commissioned into the [[Queen's Royal West Surrey Regiment]]. After brief service in France, he transferred to the [[Royal Flying Corps]] in 1915 doing research on [[aerodynamics]] at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at [[Farnborough Airfield|Farnborough]] and elsewhere. He resigned his commission as a [[Captain (land)|captain]] in 1920.

==Career==
After briefly serving in the [[First World War]] Thomson became a [[Fellow]] at Cambridge and then moved to the [[University of Aberdeen]]. George Thomson was jointly awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1937 for his work in Aberdeen in discovering the wave-like properties of the [[electron]]. The prize was shared with [[Clinton Joseph Davisson]] who had made the same discovery independently. Whereas his father had seen the electron as a [[Elementary particle|particle]] (and won his Nobel Prize in the process), Thomson demonstrated that it could be [[diffracted]] like a wave, a discovery proving the principle of [[wave–particle duality]] which had first been posited by [[Louis-Victor de Broglie]] in the 1920s as what is often dubbed the [[Matter wave|de Broglie hypothesis]].

Between 1929 and 1930 Thomson was a Non-Resident Lecturer at [[Cornell University]], [[Ithaca, New York]].<ref name="ThomsonBioOnNobelSite" /> In 1930 he was appointed Professor at [[Imperial College London]] in the chair of the late [[Hugh Longbourne Callendar]]. In the late 1930s and during the [[Second World War]] Thomson specialised in [[nuclear physics]], concentrating on practical military applications. In particular Thomson was the chairman of the crucial [[MAUD Committee]] in 1940–1941 that concluded that an [[atomic bomb]] was feasible. In later life he continued this work on nuclear energy but also wrote works on [[aerodynamics]] and the value of science in society.

Thomson stayed at Imperial College until 1952, when he became Master of [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]]. In 1964, the college honored his tenure with the George Thomson Building, a work of modernist architecture on the college's [[Leckhampton, Corpus Christi College, Cambridge|Leckhampton]] campus.

==Awards and honours==
In addition to winning the Nobel Prize in Physics, Thomson was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1943. He gave the address "Two aspects of science" as president of the [[British Science Association|British Association]] for 1959–1960.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Leake, Chauncey D.|title=Meeting: British Association for the Advancement of Science|date=14 October 1960|journal=Science|volume=132|issue=3433|pages=1023–1024|doi=10.1126/science.132.3433.1023|pmid=17820679|bibcode = 1960Sci...132.1023L }}</ref>

In 1924, Thomson married Kathleen Buchanan Smith, daughter of the [[George Adam Smith|Very Rev. Sir George Adam Smith]]. They had four children, two sons and two daughters. Kathleen died in 1941. Thomson died in 1975 and is buried with his wife in Granchester Parish Churchyard. One son, [[John Thomson (diplomat)|Sir John Thomson]] (1927–2018), became a senior diplomat who served as High Commissioner to India (1977–82) and Permanent Representative to the United Nations (1982–87), and his grandson, [[Adam Thomson (diplomat)|Sir Adam Thomson]] (1955–present), also became a senior diplomat, serving as High Commissioner to Pakistan (2010–2013) and as Permanent Representative to NATO (2014–2016). One daughter, Lillian Clare Thomson, married the South African economist and mountaineer [[Johannes de Villiers Graaff]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Botha|first=Joubert|last2=Black|first2=Philip|last3=Leibbrandt|first3=Murray|last4=Koch|first4=Steven F|date=April 2015|title=Johannes de Villiers Graaf|url=https://www.res.org.uk/uploads/assets/uploaded/b7644186-de6e-4c99-92eaec4546267f50.pdf|journal=Royal Economic Society|issue=169|pages=24-25|via=l}}</ref>
