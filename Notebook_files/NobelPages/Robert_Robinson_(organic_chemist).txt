==Biography==

===Early life===
He was born at Rufford House Farm, near [[Chesterfield, Derbyshire|Chesterfield]], Derbyshire<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/fellowship/all_fellows.pdf|title=Former RSE Fellows 1783–2002|publisher=Royal Society of Edinburgh|access-date=31 March 2010}}</ref> the son of James Bradbury Robinson, a maker of surgical dressings, and his wife, Jane Davenport.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0-902-198-84-X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}</ref>

Robinson went to school at the [[Brookfield Community School, Chesterfield|Chesterfield Grammar School]] and the private [[Fulneck School]]. He then studied Chemistry at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]], graduating BSc in 1905. In 1907 he was awarded an [[1851 Research Fellowship]] from the [[Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851]]<ref>1851 Royal Commission Archives</ref> to continue his research at the University of Manchester.

He was appointed as the first Professor of Pure and Applied Organic Chemistry in the [[School of Chemistry, University of Sydney|School of Chemistry]] at the [[University of Sydney]] in 1912.<ref>http://www.chem.usyd.edu.au/aboutus/laureates.html</ref> He was briefly at [[St Andrews University]] (1920–22) and then was offered the Chair of Organic Chemistry at [[Manchester University]]. In 1928 he moved from there to be a professor at [[University College London]] where he stayed only two years. He was the [[Waynflete Professorship|Waynflete Professor of Chemistry]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] from 1930 and a Fellow of [[Magdalen College, Oxford]].

''Robinson Close'', in the [[Science Area, Oxford|Science Area]] at [[Oxford]], is named after him,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/visitors_friends/maps_and_directions/science_area.html |title=Science Area  |publisher=www.ox.ac.uk |access-date=12 June 2009}}</ref> as is the Robert Robinson Laboratory at the [[University of Liverpool]], the Sir Robert Robinson Laboratory of Organic Chemistry at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]]<ref>In Burlington Street and opened in 1950: Charlton, H. B. (1951) ''Portrait of a University''. Manchester University Press; plan facing p. 172; since demolished.</ref> and the Robinson and Cornforth Laboratories at the University of Sydney.

Robinson was a strong amateur [[chess]] player. He represented Oxford University in a friendly match with a team from [[Bletchley Park]] in December 1944;<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=AsvSBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA38&lpg=PA38&dq=%22Robert+Robinson%22+%22I.+J.+Good%22&source=bl&ots=Xen7G23n8-&sig=PNp2UA5C1-8Aw5Jz7lRa2ftRtq4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CBwQ6AEwAGoVChMIhLKZk9XUxwIVQhaUCh3qmQ0m#v=onepage&q=%22Robert%20Robinson%22%20%22I.%20J.%20Good%22&f=false Nicholas Metropolis (ed.), ''History of Computing in the Twentieth Century'']; chapter ''Pioneering Work on Computers at Bletchley'' (I.

===Research===
His synthesis of [[tropinone]] (a precursor for [[atropine]] & [[benztropine]]) in 1917 was not only a big step in [[alkaloid]] chemistry but also showed that [[tandem reaction]]s in a [[one-pot synthesis]] are capable of forming [[bicyclic molecule]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal| last1 = Robinson | first1 = R.| title = LXIII.

[[Robinson annulation]] has had application in the [[total synthesis]] of steroids.

Alongside [[Edward Charles Dodds]], Robinson had also been involved in the orig synthesis of [[diethylstilboestrol]].<ref name="Dodds2008">{{cite journal|last1=Dodds|first1=E.

In 1957 Robinson founded the journal ''[[Tetrahedron (journal)|Tetrahedron]]'' with fifty other editors for [[Pergamon Press]].

He married twice. In 1912 he married Gertrude Maud Walsh. Following her death in 1954, in 1957 he married a widow, Mrs Stern Sylvia Hillstrom (née Hershey).<ref>{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0-902-198-84-X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}</ref>
