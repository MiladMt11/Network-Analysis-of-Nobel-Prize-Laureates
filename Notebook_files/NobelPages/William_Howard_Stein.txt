In 1936, during his graduate studies at Columbia University, William H. Stein married Phoebe Hockstader.<ref name=":0" /> They had three sons together: William H. Stein, Jr., David F. Stein, and Robert J. Stein. Stein lived with his family in [[New York (state)|New York]] the rest of his life—mainly in [[Manhattan]] and briefly in [[Scarsdale, New York]].<ref name=":0" />

=== Academic career ===
William H. Stein began his higher education as a chemistry major at [[Harvard University]] in 1929.<ref name=":0" /> He spent one year as a graduate student at Harvard University before transferring to the Department of Biological Chemistry at the College of Physicians and Surgeons, [[Columbia University]], in 1934 to focus on [[biochemistry]].<ref name=":0" /> [[Hans Thacher Clarke|Hans Thatcher Clarke]], the chairman of the department at the time, was collecting many talented graduate students who would become the distinguished biochemists of the early twentieth century.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" /> In 1937, Stein completed his thesis on the amino acid composition of [[elastin]], earning his Ph.D.<ref name=":0" /> Stein was introduced to potassium trioxalatochromate and ammonium rhodanilate by [[Max Bergmann]], a Jewish-German biochemist who fled to the United States in 1934 under threat of Nazi occupation and worked in a laboratory at the [[Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research|Rockefeller Institute]].<ref name=":2" /> He used these two precipitating agents to isolate the amino acids [[glycine]] and [[proline]], respectively, for his research on elastin.<ref name=":2" /> With the conclusion of his academic career, Stein went on to work under Bergmann.<ref name=":0" />

=== Late Life and Death ===

William H. Stein and his wife traveled around the world and hosted many prominent scientists in their own home in New York City throughout his scientific career.<ref name=":0" /> In addition to Stein’s long-term professorship at Rockefeller Institute, he served as a visiting professor to the [[University of Chicago]] in 1961 and [[Harvard University]] in 1964.<ref name=":2" /> Stein also lectured at the [[Washington University in St. Louis]] and [[Haverford College]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1972|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1972/stein/biographical/|access-date=2021-04-16|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 1969, Stein suffered from sudden paralysis, diagnosed as [[Guillain–Barré syndrome|Guillain-Barré syndrome]], after developing a fever several days prior during a symposium in [[Copenhagen]].<ref name=":0" /> Despite remaining [[Tetraplegia|quadriplegic]] the rest of his life, Stein’s colleagues alleged that his spirit and sense of humor endured.<ref name=":0" /> He continued to be a guiding presence at the Rockefeller Institute to his younger colleagues and their work on the study of [[Ribonuclease|RNase]].<ref name=":0" /> At the age of sixty-eight, Stein experienced unexpected heart failure.<ref name=":0" /> William H. Stein died 2 February 1980 in New York City.<ref name=":0" />

==Scientific career==

===Early Work===
Following the completion of his formal education, Stein became a researcher under Bergmann at Rockefeller Institute, where much of his most important work was done.<ref name=":3" /> [[Stanford Moore]] joined Bergmann's lab in 1939, where he and Stein began research focusing on amino acids.<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal| vauthors = Kresge N, Simoni RD, Hill RL |date=March 2005|title=The Fruits of Collaboration: Chromatography, Amino Acid Analyzers, and the Chemical Structure of Ribonuclease by William H. Stein and Stanford Moore |journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|volume=280|issue=9|pages=e6–e8|doi=10.1016/s0021-9258(19)30642-8|issn=0021-9258|doi-access=free}}</ref> According to Moore, "During the early years of our cooperation, Stein and I worked out a system of collaboration that lasted for a lifetime."<ref name=":0" /> Their work in this area was disrupted with the beginning of [[World War II]], and they temporarily parted ways to aid the war efforts, Stein staying with Bergmann to research the molecular scale effect of [[blister agent]]s on the human body.<ref name=":02" /> They began collaborating again, however, after Bergmann died in 1944 and they were given an opportunity by the Director of the Rockefeller Institute, [[Herbert Spencer Gasser|Herbert S. Gasser]], to continue Bergmann’s work in amino acids.<ref name=":02" />

===Chromatography===
Stein and Moore developed a method to quantify and separate amino acids with [[column chromatography]], using [[potato starch]] as the stationary phase.<ref name=":02" /> The [[Fraction (chemistry)|fractions]], originally collected manually, were collected in their newly developed automated fraction collector, and the amount of each amino acid was determined by an adjusted [[color reaction]] with [[ninhydrin]].<ref name=":4" /> They began testing other methods of separation, such as [[Ion chromatography|ion exchange chromatography]], to reduce the analysis time, as it took two weeks to analyze one protein using the starch columns.<ref name=":02" /> Ion exchange chromatography reduced the time to 5 days during initial experiments, and eventually Stein and Moore whittled the process down even further with the help of Daryl Spackman, which resulted in the first automatic amino acid analyzer.<ref name=":02" /> Along with their well-known work in protein sequences, this automatic amino acid analyzer was also utilized in Stein’s study of amino acids in human urine<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Stein WH | title = A chromatographic investigation of the amino acid constituents of normal urine | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 201 | issue = 1 | pages = 45–58 | date = March 1953 | doi = 10.1016/S0021-9258(18)71347-1 | pmid = 13044774 | doi-access = free }}</ref> and blood plasma.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Brigham MP, Stein WH, Moore S | title = The concentrations of cysteine and cystine in human blood plasma | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 39 | issue = 11 | pages = 1633–8 | date = November 1960 | pmid = 16695834 | pmc = 293403 | doi = 10.1172/JCI104186 }}</ref>

===Determination of Protein Sequences===
With their success in improving the analysis time for amino acids, Stein and Moore began to determine the structure of an entire protein molecule, specifically bovine ribonuclease, in the early 1950s.<ref>{{Cite journal| vauthors  = Kresge N, Simoni RD, Hill RL |date=2005-12-05|title=The Elucidation of the Structure of Ribonuclease by Stanford Moore and William H.
