{{nihongo|'''Kenzaburō Ōe'''|大江 健三郎|Ōe Kenzaburō|extra=born 31 January 1935}} is a Japanese writer and a major figure in contemporary [[Japanese literature]]. His novels, short stories and essays, strongly influenced by French and American literature and [[literary theory]], deal with political, social and philosophical issues, including [[nuclear weapon]]s, [[nuclear power]], [[anticonformism|social non-conformism]], and [[existentialism]]. Ōe was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1994 for creating "an [[imaginary world|imagined world]], where life and myth condense to form a disconcerting picture of the human predicament today".<ref name="shimbun2008">[http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/20080518dy01.htm "Oe, Pamuk: World needs imagination"], Yomiuri.co.jp; May 18, 2008.</ref>

==Life==
Ōe was born in {{nihongo|[[Ōse, Ehime|Ōse]]|大瀬村|Ōse-mura}}, a village now in [[Uchiko, Ehime|Uchiko, Ehime Prefecture]] on [[Shikoku]]. He was the third son of seven children. Ōe's grandmother taught him art and oral performance. His grandmother died in 1944, and later that year, Ōe's father died in the [[World War II|Pacific War]]. Ōe's mother became his primary educator, buying him books such as ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' and ''[[The Wonderful Adventures of Nils]]'', whose impact Ōe says "he will carry to the grave".<ref name=nobel>{{cite web |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1994/oe.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1994: Kenzaburo Oe (biography) |publisher=Nobel media|access-date=2013-05-02}}</ref>

Ōe remembers his elementary school teacher claiming that Emperor [[Hirohito]] was a living god, and asking him every morning, "What would you do if the emperor commanded you to die?" Ōe always replied, "I would die, sir. I would cut open my belly and die." At home in bed at night he would acknowledge his reluctance to die and feel ashamed.<ref name="weston">{{cite book|last=Weston|first=Mark|title=Giants of Japan: The Lives of Japan's Most Influential Men and Women|publisher=Kodansha International|year=1999|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/giantsofjapanliv00west/page/294 294–295, 299]|isbn=1-568362862|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/giantsofjapanliv00west/page/294}}</ref> After the war, he realized he had been taught lies and felt betrayed. This sense of betrayal later appeared in his writing.<ref name="weston"/>

Ōe attended high school in [[Matsuyama, Ehime|Matsuyama]]. At the age of 18, he made his first trip to Tokyo and in the following year began studying French Literature at [[Tokyo University]] under the direction of Professor Kazuo Watanabe, a specialist on [[François Rabelais]]. Ōe began publishing stories in 1957, while still a student, strongly influenced by contemporary writing in France and the United States.

In 1959 and 1960, Ōe participated in the [[Anpo protests]] against the [[U.S.-Japan Security Treaty]] as a member of a group of young writers, artists, and composers called the "Young Japan Society" (''Wakai Nihon no Kai'').<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kapur|first=Nick|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Re5hDwAAQBAJ|title=Japan at the Crossroads: Conflict and Compromise after Anpo|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2018|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|ISBN=978-0674984424|pages=177}}</ref> The treaty allows the United States to maintain military bases in Japan, and Ōe's disappointment at the failure of the protests to stop the treaty shaped his future writing.<ref name=Jaggi/><ref>{{Cite book|last=Kapur|first=Nick|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Re5hDwAAQBAJ|title=Japan at the Crossroads: Conflict and Compromise after Anpo|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2018|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|ISBN=978-0674984424|pages=216}}</ref>

Ōe married in February 1960. His wife, Yukari, was the daughter of film director [[Mansaku Itami]] and sister of film director [[Juzo Itami]]. The same year he met [[Mao Zedong]] on a trip to China. He also went to Russia and Europe the following year, visiting [[Jean-Paul Sartre|Sartre]] in Paris.<ref>[https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5816/kenzaburo-oe-the-art-of-fiction-no-195-kenzaburo-oe Kenzaburo Oe, The Art of Fiction No. 195] ''The Paris Review''</ref><ref name=Jaggi>{{Cite web|title = Profile: Kenzaburo Oë|url = https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/05/featuresreviews.guardianreview9|website = the Guardian|access-date = 2015-11-22|first = Maya|last = Jaggi}}</ref>

In 1961, Ōe's novellas ''Seventeen'' and ''The Death of a Political Youth'' were published by a Japanese literary magazine. Both were inspired by seventeen-year-old [[Yamaguchi Otoya]], who assassinated the chairman of Japan's Socialist Party in 1960, and then killed himself in prison three weeks later. Yamaguchi had admirers among the extreme [[right-wing politics|right wing]] who were angered by ''The Death of a Political Youth'' and both Ōe and the magazine received [[death threat]]s day and night for weeks. The magazine soon apologized to offended readers, but Ōe did not,<ref name="weston" /> and he was later physically assaulted by an angry right-winger while giving a speech at [[Tokyo University]].<ref name=Jaggi/>

Ōe lives in Tokyo. He has three children; the eldest son, [[Hikari Ōe|Hikari]], has been brain-damaged since his birth in 1963, and his disability has been a recurring motif in Ōe's writings since.

In 1994 Ōe won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] and was named to receive Japan's [[Order of Culture]]. He refused the latter because it is bestowed by the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]]. Ōe said, "I do not recognize any authority, any value, higher than democracy." Once again, he received threats.<ref name="weston" />
[[File:手話通訳 (8930900696).jpg|thumb|Ōe at a 2013 antinuclear demonstration in Tokyo]]
In 2005, two retired Japanese military officers sued Ōe for [[libel]] for his 1970 essay, ''Okinawa Notes'', in which he had written that members of the Japanese military had coerced masses of Okinawan civilians into committing suicide during the [[Battle of Okinawa|Allied invasion of the island]] in 1945. In March 2008, the [[Osaka]] District Court dismissed all charges against Ōe. In this ruling, Judge Toshimasa Fukami stated, "The military was deeply involved in the [[mass suicide]]s". In a news conference following the trial, Ōe said, "The judge accurately read my writing."<ref>{{cite book|first=Norimitsu|last=Onishi|authorlink=Norimitsu Onishi|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/29/world/asia/29japan.html?scp=2&sq=kenzaburo+oe&st=nyt|title=Japanese Court Rejects Defamation Lawsuit Against Nobel Laureate|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 29, 2008}}</ref>

Ōe has been involved with [[pacifist]] and [[anti-nuclear]] campaigns and has written books regarding the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]] and the [[Hibakusha]]. After meeting prominent anti-nuclear activist [[Noam Chomsky]] at a Harvard degree ceremony, Ōe began his correspondence with Chomsky by sending him a copy of his ''Okinawa Notes''. While also discussing Ōe's ''Okinawa Notes'', Chomsky's reply included a story from his childhood. Chomsky wrote that when he first heard about the [[atomic bombing of Hiroshima]], he could not bear it being celebrated, and he went in the woods and sat alone until the evening.<ref>Oe, K., & Chomsky, N.

==Writing==
Ōe explained, shortly after learning that he had been awarded the Nobel Prize, "I am writing about the dignity of human beings."<ref name="nyt1994">Sterngold, James. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E6D9143CF937A25753C1A962958260&scp=3&sq=kenzaburo+oe&st=nyt "Nobel in Literature Goes to Kenzaburo Oe of Japan,"] ''New York Times.'' October 14, 1994.</ref>

After his first student works set in his own university milieu, in the late 1950s he produced works such as Shiiku (飼育), about a black GI set upon by Japanese youth (made into a film, "The Catch" by [[Nagisa Oshima]] in 1961) and ''[[Nip the Buds, Shoot the Kids]]'', focusing on young children living in [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]]n transformations of Ōe's own rural [[Shikoku]] childhood.<ref name="wilson12">Wilson, Michiko. (1986) [https://books.google.com/books?id=2jhGkLyWN8cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=he+Marginal+World+of+%C5%8Ce+Kenzabur%C5%8D:+A+Study+in+Themes+and+Techniques++ISBN&client=firefox-a&source=gbs_summary_r&cad=0#PPA12,M1 ''The Marginal World of Ōe Kenzaburō: A Study in Themes and Techniques,'' p. 12.]</ref> He later identified these child figures as belonging to the '[[Child (archetype)|child god]]' [[archetype]] of [[Carl Jung|Jung]] and [[Karl Kerényi|Kerényi]], which is characterised by abandonment, [[hermaphrodism]], invincibility, and association with beginning and end.<ref>Ōe, ''The Method of a Novel,'' p. 197.</ref> The first two characteristics are present in these early stories, while the latter two features come to the fore in the 'idiot boy' stories which appeared after the birth of Hikari.<ref>Wilson, p. 135.</ref>

Between 1958 and 1961 Ōe published a series of works incorporating sexual metaphors for the occupation of Japan. He summarised the common theme of these stories as "the relationship of a foreigner as the big power [Z], a Japanese who is more or less placed in a humiliating position [X], and, sandwiched between the two, the third party [Y] (sometimes a prostitute who caters only to foreigners or an interpreter)".<ref>Ōe, ''Ōe Kenzaburō Zensakuhin'', Vol. 2 (Supplement No. 3). p. 16.</ref> In each of these works, the Japanese X is inactive, failing to take the initiative to resolve the situation and showing no psychological or spiritual development.<ref>Wilson p. 32.</ref> The graphically sexual nature of this group of stories prompted a critical outcry; Ōe said of the culmination of the series ''Our Times'', "I personally like this novel [because] I do not think I will ever write another novel which is filled only with sexual words."<ref>Wilson, p. 29.</ref>

Ōe's next phase moved away from sexual content, shifting this time toward the violent fringes of society. The works which he published between 1961 and 1964 are influenced by [[existentialism]] and [[picaresque]] literature, populated with more or less criminal rogues and [[anti-heroes]] whose position on the fringes of society allows them to make pointed criticisms of it.<ref>Wilson p. 47.</ref> Ōe's admission that Mark Twain's ''[[Huckleberry Finn]]'' is his favorite book can be said to find a context in this period.<ref>Theroux, Paul. [https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10A12FD3F5A17768FDDA10894DA405B808BF1D3 "Speaking of Books: Creative Dissertating; Creative Dissertating"], nytimes.com, February 8, 1970.</ref>

He explains, "I have always wanted to write about our country, our society and feelings about the contemporary scene. But there is a big difference between us and classic Japanese literature." In 1994, he explained that he was proud the Swedish Academy recognized the strength of modern Japanese literature and hoped the prize would encourage others.<ref name="nyt1994"/>

According to [[Leo Ou-fan Lee]] writing in [[Muse (Hong Kong magazine)|''Muse'']], Ōe's latest works tend "toward bolder experiments with the technique of 'defamiliarization' by negotiating his narratives across several imaginary landscapes pertaining to painting, film, drama, music and architecture".<ref>{{cite journal |last= Lee |first= Leo Ou-fan |date=November 2009 |title= Always too late |journal= Muse Magazine |issue= 34 |pages= 104}}</ref> Ōe believes that novelists have always worked to spur the imagination of their readers.<ref name="shimbun2008"/>

===About his son Hikari===
[[File:The Healing Family Kenzaburo Oe.jpg|thumb|right|Book cover of the 1996 English version of Kenzaburō Ōe's book about his handicapped son and their life as a family.]]
Ōe credits his son Hikari for influencing his literary career. Ōe tried to give his son a "voice" through his writing. Several of Ōe's books feature a character based on his son.<ref>[http://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/edpsychology/nav03.cfm?nav03=18675&nav02=14211&nav01=13954 Sobsey, Richard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701005232/http://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/edpsychology/nav03.cfm?nav03=18675&nav02=14211&nav01=13954 |date=2009-07-01 }}. [http://www.chninternational.com/hikarich.htm "Hikari Finds His Voice,"] Canadian Broadcast Corporation (CBC), produced by Compassionate Healthcare Network (CHN). July 1995.</ref>

In Ōe's 1964 book, ''A Personal Matter'', the writer describes the psychological trauma involved in accepting his brain-damaged son into his life.<ref name="nobel1994">Nobel Prize, [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1994/oe-bio.html 1994 laureate biography]</ref> Hikari figures prominently in many of the books singled out for praise by the Nobel committee:

Hikari's life is the core of the first book published after Ōe was awarded the Nobel Prize. The 1996 book, ''A Healing Family,'' celebrates the small victories in Hikari's life.<ref name="worldcat_hikari">[http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/identities/default.htm WorldCat Identities] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230150412/http://www.oclc.org/research/activities/identities/default.htm |date=2010-12-30 }}: [http://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-nr95-16920 Ōe, Hikari 1963–&nbsp;]</ref>

Hikari was a strong influence on ''[[Father, Where are you Going?]]'', ''Teach Us to Outgrow Our Madness,'' and ''[[The Day He Himself Shall Wipe My Tears Away]],'' three novels which rework the same premise—the father of a disabled son attempts to recreate the life of his own father, who shut himself away and died. The protagonist's ignorance of his father is compared to his son's inability to understand him; the lack of information about his father's story makes the task impossible to complete, but capable of endless repetition, and, "repetition becomes the fabric of the stories".<ref>Wilson, p. 61.</ref>

===2006–2008===
Ōe did not write much during the nearly two years (2006–2008) of his libel case. He is beginning a new novel, which ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported would feature a character "based on his father", a staunch supporter of the imperial system who drowned in a flood during World War&nbsp;II.<ref name="The Saturday Profile">{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/17/world/asia/17oe.html?partner=rssnyt&emc=rss | title=The Saturday Profile: Released From Rigors of a Trial, a Nobel Laureate's Ink Flows Freely | work=New York Times | date=May 17, 2008 | access-date=November 9, 2019 | author=Onishi, Norimitsu | author-link=Norimitsu Onishi}}</ref>

===2013===
Ōe published a new book at the end of 2013. Named ''Bannen Yoshikishu'' and published by Kodansha (English title is ''In Late Style'').

The novel is the sixth in a series with the main character of Kogito Choko, who can be considered Ōe's literary alter ego. The novel is also in a sense a culmination of the I-novels that Ōe has continued to write since his son was born mentally disabled in 1963.

In the novel, Choko loses interest in the novel he had been writing when the [[Great East Japan earthquake]] and tsunami struck the [[Tohoku]] region on March 11, 2011. Instead, he begins writing about an age of catastrophe, as well as about the fact that he himself is approaching his late 70s.<ref name=latest>{{cite web |url=http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/culture/AJ201312160006 |title=Oe's latest novel offers glimmer of hope in a world beset by catastrophe |access-date=2013-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216190527/http://ajw.asahi.com/article/cool_japan/culture/AJ201312160006 |archive-date=2013-12-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Nobel lecture==
Ōe's Nobel lecture on 7 December 1994 entitled "Aimai na Nihon no watashi" (Japan, the Ambiguous and Myself)<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1994/oe-lecture.html]</ref> began with a commentary on his life as a child and how he was fascinated by ''The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn'' and ''The Wonderful Adventures of Nils'', which he used to take his mind off from the terror of World War II. He described surviving various hardships by using writing as an escape, "representing these sufferings of mine in the form of the novel," and how his son Hikari similarly uses music as a method of expressing "the voice of a crying and dark soul."

Ōe dedicated a large portion of his speech to his opinion of [[Yasunari Kawabata]]'s acceptance speech, saying that the vagueness of Kawabata's title and his discussions of the poems written by medieval Zen monks were the inspiration for the title of his acceptance speech. Ōe, however, stated that rather than feeling spiritual affinity with his compatriot Kawabata, he felt more affinity with the Irish poet, [[William Butler Yeats]], whose poetry had a significant effect on his writings and his life, even being a major inspiration for his trilogy, ''A Flaming Green Tree'' and the source of its title. Ōe stated, "Yeats is the writer in whose wake I would like to follow." He mentioned that based on his experiences of Japan, he cannot utter in unison with Kawabata the phrase "Japan, the Beautiful and Myself". Ōe also discussed the revival of militaristic feelings in Japan and the necessity for rejecting these feelings, and how Ōe desired to be of use in a cure and reconciliation of mankind.
