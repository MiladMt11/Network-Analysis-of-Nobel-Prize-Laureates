==Biography==
Johnson was born Olof Edvin Verner Jonsson in [[Svartbjörnsbyn]] village in [[Överluleå]] parish, near the town of [[Boden, Sweden|Boden]] in [[Norrbotten County|Norrbotten]]. The small house where he was born is preserved and marked with a commemorative plaque. 

Johnson left school at the age of thirteen and then held various jobs such as [[log driving]] and working at a [[saw mill]] and as a ticket-seller and projectionist in a [[Movie theatre|cinema]]. In 1919 he left his hometown and moved to [[Stockholm]] where he began to publish articles in [[anarchist]] magazines like ''[[Brand (magazine)|Brand]]''. In Stockholm he became friends with other young [[proletarian writer]]s and started the magazine ''Vår nutid''. He travelled in Germany in the 1920s and lived in [[Saint-Leu-la-Foret]], near [[Paris]], France, between 1927 and 1930 with his wife Aase Christoffersen  (1900–1938). At this point he had published his first books. The first ''De fyra främlingarna'', a collection of short stories, was published in 1924. Influenced by writers such as [[Marcel Proust]], [[André Gide]] and [[James Joyce]], Johnson gradually took distance from the traditional novel and became the most important representative of [[modernist literature]] in Sweden. Johnson's early novels was not widely read, but his 1929 novel ''Kommentar till ett stjärnfall'' ("Comment on a falling star"), an attack on [[capitalist society]], was a critical success.<ref name="A"> Petri Liukonnen [http://authorscalendar.info/eyvindj.htm Eyvind Johnson] Books and writers</ref>

Johnson's first major success as a writer was four [[autobiographical novel]]s published between 1934 and 1937, published together as ''[[Romanen om Olof]]'' ("The Novel about Olof"), about a young man growing up in the northern parts of Sweden. In the novels Johnson blended realism with fairy tales and typical modernist features such as [[inner monologue]] and changing [[point of view (literature)|point of view]]. ''Romanen om Olof'' became a [[classic book|classic]] in Swedish literature and was later filmed as ''[[Here Is Your Life]]''.<ref name="A"></ref>

Increasingly upset by the rising totalitarianism in the 1930s, Johnson was strongly against [[fascism]] and [[nazism]].<ref name="A"></ref> During [[World War II]] he was editor of the magazine ''[[Håndslag]]'' and published ''[[Krilon]]'', a trilogy of novels that in the form of an [[allegory]] deals with the events during the war. In the novels Johnson condemns nazi oppression and criticises the controversial [[Sweden during World War II|Swedish neutrality policy]] during the war.<ref name="A"></ref> ''Krilon'' is considered to be one of Johnson's best works.<ref>Örjan Lindberger ''Människan i tiden: Eyvind Johnsons liv och författarskap 1938-1976'', Bonniers 1990 {{ISBN|91-0-047904-7}}, p. 134 </ref><ref>Gavin Orton ''Eyvind Johnson. En monografi'' Aldus 1974 {{ISBN|91-0-039665-6}}, p. 73</ref>

In 1946 he published one of his most famous novels ''[[Return to Ithaca (novel)|Return to Ithaca]]'', based on the story of [[Odysseus]] as he returns to Ithaca after the Trojan war. Johnson married translator Cilla Johnson in 1940. He lived with his family in Switzerland 1947–1949 and then a year in England. Travels to Italy and France inspired him to write several well-received [[historical novels]]. Among the best known are ''[[Dreams of Roses and Fire]]'' (''Drömmar om rosor och eld'', 1949) set in [[Cardinal Richelieu]]s 17th century France, and ''Molnen över Metapontion'' ("The Clouds above Metapontion", 1957) that typically for his later novels switches back and forth between different time levels. In 1957 he was elected a member of the [[Swedish Academy]].

Johnson's most noted works internationally include ''[[Return to Ithaca (novel)|Return to Ithaca]]'' and ''[[The Days of His Grace]]'' (''Hans nådes tid'', 1960) which have been translated to many languages. For the latter novel Johnson was awarded the [[Nordic Council Literature Prize]] in 1962.<ref>[https://www.norden.org/en/literature-prize Nordic Council Literature Prize]</ref> In 1974 Eyvind Johnson was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] (shared with [[Harry Martinson]]).<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/literature/1974/summary/ The Nobel Prize in Literature 1974] nobelprize.org</ref>

==Controversy==
The choice of Johnson and Harry Martinson as Nobel Prize winners in 1974 was controversial as both were on the Nobel panel themselves and [[Graham Greene]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[Saul Bellow]] and [[Jorge Luis Borges]] were the favoured candidates that year.<ref>{{cite web|author=Raúl Fain Binda BBC Mundo |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/mundo/noticias/2012/08/120807_lalo_londres_2012_cuartos_2.shtml |title=BBC Mundo – Noticias – Londres 2012: el cruel destino del atleta que llega cuarto |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1 January 1970 |access-date=13 August 2012}}</ref>
