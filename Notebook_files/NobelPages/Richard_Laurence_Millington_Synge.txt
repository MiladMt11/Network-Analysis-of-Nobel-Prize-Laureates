==Life==
Richard Laurence Millington Synge was born in [[West Kirby]] on 28 October 1914, the son of Lawrence Millington Synge, a Liverpool stock-broker, and his wife, Katherine C. Swan.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0-902-198-84-X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}</ref> 

Synge was educated at the Old Hall in [[Wellington, Shropshire]] and at [[Winchester College]]. He then studied Chemistry at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]]. 

He spent his entire career in research, at the [[Wool Industries Research Association]], Leeds (1941–1943), [[Lister Institute for Preventive Medicine]], London (1943–1948), [[Rowett Research Institute]], Aberdeen (1948–1967), and [[Institute of Food Research|Food Research Institute]], Norwich (1967–1976).<ref>{{cite web|title=Richard Lawrence Millington Synge|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/obits_alpha/synge_richard.pdf|publisher=Royal Society of Edinburgh|access-date=25 August 2015}}</ref>

It was during his time in [[Leeds]] that he worked with [[Archer John Porter Martin|Archer Martin]], developing [[partition chromatography]], a technique used in the separation mixtures of similar chemicals, that revolutionised analytical chemistry.<ref>{{Cite journal| volume = 19| issue = 5| pages = 506–512| last = Ettre| first = C.| title = Milestones in Chromatography: The Birth of Partition Chromatography| journal = LCGC| access-date = 26 February 2016|year = 2001| url = http://images.alfresco.advanstar.com/alfresco_images/pharma/2014/08/22/1598ed6f-5bbe-400b-bc08-ff07d2c59826/article-2090.pdf}}</ref> Between 1942 and 1948 he studied [[peptide]]s of the protein group [[gramicidin]], work later used by [[Frederick Sanger]] in determining the structure of [[insulin]]. In March 1950 he was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] for which his candidature citation read:
{{quotation|Distinguished as a biochemist. Was the first to show the possibility of using counter-current liquid-liquid extraction in the separation of N-acetylamino acids. In collaboration with A.J.P. Martin this led to the development of partition chromatography, which they have applied with conspicuous success in problems related to the composition and structure of proteins, particularly wool keratin. Synge's recent work on the composition and structure of gramicidins is outstanding and illustrates vividly the great advances in technique for which he and Martin are responsible.|{{cite web |url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=1&dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27synge%27%29|title=Library and Archive catalogue|publisher= Royal Society}}}}

In 1963 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[Magnus Pyke]], [[A. T. Phillipson|Andrew Phillipson]], Sir [[David Cuthbertson]] and [[John Andrew Crichton]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0-902-198-84-X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}</ref>

He was for several years the treasurer of the Chemical Information Group of the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]], and held a Professorship in Biological Sciences at the [[University of East Anglia]] from 1968 to 1984. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science (ScD) from the [[University of East Anglia]] in 1977, and an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Mathematics and Science at [[Uppsala University]], Sweden in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|title=Honorary Graduates of the University|url=https://portal.uea.ac.uk/documents/6207125/7409549/Honorary+Graduates+Of+UEA+%28updated+Nov13%29.pdf/a28a0862-1178-474e-b921-5f7621f6ed79|publisher=[[University of East Anglia]]|access-date=4 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/prizes/honorary-doctorates/|title=Honorary doctorates – Uppsala University, Sweden|website=uu.se|access-date=19 April 2018}}</ref>

==Personal life==
In 1943 Synge married Ann Davies Stephen (1916 - 1997).<ref>{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0-902-198-84-X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}</ref> Ann Stephen was the daughter of psychologist [[Karin Stephen]] and psychoanalyst [[Adrian Stephen]]. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp96464/ann-davies-synge-nee-stephen|title=National Portrait Gallery: Adrian Stephen|access-date=28 July 2020}}</ref> Ann's sister Judith was married to documentary artist and photographer [[Nigel Henderson (artist)|Nigel Henderson]].
