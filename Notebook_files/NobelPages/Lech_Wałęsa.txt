After winning the [[1990 Polish presidential election|1990 election]], Wałęsa became the first democratically elected President of Poland since [[May Coup (Poland)|1926]] and the first-ever Polish President elected in [[Direct election|popular vote]]. A shipyard electrician by trade, Wałęsa became the leader of the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity movement]], and led a successful pro-democratic effort which in 1989 ended the [[Communist rule in Poland]] and ushered in the end of the [[Cold war|Cold War]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/polands-new-nationalist-rulers-are-erasing-lech-walesa-from-history-1516636420|title=Poland's New Nationalist Rulers Are Erasing Lech Walesa From History|last=Walker|first=Drew Hinshaw and Marcus|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=1 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://freedomcenter.org/IFCA/about-lech-walesa|title=About Lech Walesa {{!}} National Underground Railroad Freedom Center|website=freedomcenter.org|access-date=1 September 2019|archive-date=1 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190901212949/https://freedomcenter.org/IFCA/about-lech-walesa|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lech-Walesa|title=Lech Walesa {{!}} Biography, Solidarity, Nobel Prize, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=1 September 2019}}</ref>

While working at the [[Lenin Shipyard]] (now Gdańsk Shipyard), Wałęsa, an electrician, became a trade-union activist, for which he was persecuted by the [[Polish United Workers' Party|Communist authorities]], placed under surveillance, fired in 1976, and arrested several times. In August 1980, he was instrumental in political negotiations that led to the ground-breaking [[Gdańsk Agreement]] between striking workers and the government. He co-founded the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] trade-union whose membership rose to over ten million people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Solidarity|title=Solidarity {{!}} Definition, History, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=2 December 2019}}</ref>

After [[martial law in Poland]] was imposed and Solidarity was outlawed, Wałęsa was again arrested.

Since 1980, Wałęsa has received hundreds of [[List of awards and honors received by Lech Wałęsa|prizes, honors and awards]] from many countries of the world. He was named the [[Time Person of the Year]] (1981) and one of [[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century|Time's 100 most important people of the 20th century]] (1999).

In 1961, Lech graduated from primary and [[vocational school]] in nearby [[Chalin, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Chalin]] and [[Lipno, Poland|Lipno]] as a qualified electrician. He worked as a car mechanic from 1961 to 1965, and then embarked on his two-year, obligatory military service, attaining the rank of [[corporal]] before beginning work on 12 July 1967 as an electrician at [[Lenin Shipyard]]  ({{lang|pl|Stocznia Gdańska im. Lenina}}), now called Gdańsk Shipyard ({{lang|pl|Stocznia Gdańska}}) in [[Gdańsk]].<ref>Page 95. Walesa, Lech. "The Struggle and the Triumph: An Autobiography".

On 8 November 1969, Wałęsa married [[Danuta Wałęsa|Mirosława Danuta Gołoś]], who worked at a flower shop near the Lenin Shipyard.

==Solidarity movement==
{{main|Solidarity (Polish trade union)}}
From early in his career, Wałęsa was interested in workers' concerns; in 1968 he encouraged shipyard colleagues to boycott official rallies that condemned [[1968 Polish political crisis|recent student strikes]].<ref name=institute2/> He was a charismatic leader,<ref name=britannica/> who helped organize the illegal [[1970 Polish protests|1970 protests]] at the Gdańsk Shipyard when workers protested the government's decree raising [[food prices]] and he was considered for the position of chairman of the strike committee.<ref name=CNNCwar/><ref name=institute2/> The strikes' outcome, which involved the deaths of over 30 workers, galvanized Wałęsa's views on the need for change.<ref name=institute2/> In June 1976, Wałęsa lost his job at the Gdańsk Shipyard because of his continued involvement in illegal unions, strikes, and a campaign to commemorate the victims of the 1970 protests.<ref name=CNNCwar/><ref name=institute2/><ref name="institute1"/> Afterwards, he worked as an electrician for several other companies but his activism led to him continually being laid off and he was jobless for long periods.<ref name=institute2/> Wałęsa and his family were under constant surveillance by the [[Ministry of Public Security of Poland|Polish secret police]]; his home and workplace were always bugged.<ref name=institute2/> Over the next few years, he was arrested several times for participating in dissident activities.<ref name=CNNCwar/>

[[File:Strajk sierpniowy w Stoczni Gdańskiej im. Lenina 22.jpg|thumb|left|Wałęsa during the strike at the Lenin Shipyard, August 1980]]

Wałęsa worked closely with the [[Workers' Defence Committee]] (''KOR''), a group that emerged to lend aid to people arrested after the 1976 labor strikes and to their families.<ref name=CNNCwar/> In June 1978, he became an activist of the underground [[Free Trade Unions of the Coast]] (''Wolne Związki Zawodowe Wybrzeża'').<ref name="institute1"/> On 14 August 1980, another rise in food prices led to a strike at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk, of which Wałęsa was one of the instigators. Wałęsa climbed over the shipyard fence and quickly became one of the strike leaders.<ref name=CNNCwar/><ref name=institute2/> The strike inspired other similar strikes in Gdańsk, which then spread across Poland. Wałęsa headed the [[Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee]], coordinating the workers at Gdańsk and at 20 other plants in the region.<ref name=CNNCwar/> On 31 August, the government, represented by [[Mieczysław Jagielski]], signed an accord (the [[Gdańsk Agreement]]) with the Strike Coordinating Committee.<ref name=CNNCwar/> The agreement granted the Lenin Shipyard workers the right to strike and permitted them to form an independent trade union.<ref name=BookOneThree>{{Cite book|last=Hunter|first=Richard J.|author2=Leo V.

On 10 March 1981, through the introduction of his former superior in the army,  Wałęsa met Jaruzelski for the first time in the [[Chancellery of the Prime Minister of Poland|office building of the Council of Ministers]] for three hours. During the meeting, Jaruzelski and Wałęsa agreed that mutual trust was necessary if the problems of Poland were to be solved. Wałęsa said "It's not the case that the name of socialism is bad. Only some people spoiled the name of socialism". He also complained about and criticized the government. Jaruzelski informed Wałęsa of the coming war games of the Warsaw Pact from 16 to 25 March, hoping he could help maintain the social order and avoid anti-Soviet remarks. Jaruzelski also reminded Wałęsa that Solidarity had used foreign funds. Wałęsa joked "We don't have to take only dollars. We can take corn, fertilizer, anything is okay. I told [[Stanisław Kania|Mr. Kania]] before that I would take everything from the enemy. The more the better, until the enemy was weakened no more".<ref name=Liu>{{cite book |last1=Liu |first1=Yanshun |title=Jaruzelski, the Shaker of Polish History |date=1 July 2016 |publisher=Shijiezhishi |location=Beijing, China |isbn=9787501252299 |pages=54–57 |edition= 1 |ref=Liu |language=zh}}</ref>

After months of strikes and political deliberations, at the conclusion of the 10th [[plenary session]] of the [[Polish United Workers' Party]] (PZPR, the Polish communist party), the government agreed to enter into [[Polish Round Table Agreement|Round Table Negotiations]] that lasted from February to April 1989.<ref name=CNNCwar/> Wałęsa was an informal leader of the non-governmental side in the negotiations.<ref name="institute1"/> During the talks, he traveled throughout Poland giving speeches in support of the negotiations.<ref name=CNNCwar/> At the end of the talks, the government signed an agreement to re-establish the Solidarity Trade Union and to organize semi-free elections to the Polish parliament; in accordance with the Round Table Agreement, only members of the Communist Party and its allies could stand for 65 percent of the seats in the lower house, the [[Sejm]].<ref name=CNNCwar/><ref name=ash/><ref>"Half-free and far from easy: Poland's election", ''The Economist'', 27 May 1989.</ref><ref>Lewis Pauk, "Non-Competitive Elections and Regime Change: Poland 1989," ''Parliamentary Affairs'', 1990, 43: 90–107.</ref>

In December 1988, Wałęsa co-founded the [[Solidarity Citizens' Committee]];<ref name="institute1"/> this was ostensibly an advisory body but in practice a political party that won the [[1989 Polish legislative election|parliamentary elections in June 1989]].

While ostensibly only chairman of Solidarity, Wałęsa played a key role in practical politics. In August 1989, he persuaded leaders of parties formerly allied with the Communist Party to form a non-communist coalition government—the first non-Communist government in the [[Soviet Bloc]]. The parliament elected [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]] as the first non-communist [[Prime Minister of Poland]] in over forty years.<ref name=ash>Timothy Garton Ash, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080306063801/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988170,00.html Lech Wałęsa], TIME magazine,"The Most Important People of the Century", 13 April 1998.</ref>

Following the June 1989 parliamentary elections, Wałęsa was disappointed that some of his former fellow campaigners were satisfied to govern alongside former Communists.<ref name=ash/> He decided to run for the newly re-established office of [[President of Poland|president]], using the slogan, "I don't want to, but I have to" (''"Nie chcę, ale muszę."'').<ref name=CNNCwar/><ref name=ash/> On 9 December 1990, Wałęsa won the [[1990 Polish presidential election|presidential election]], defeating Prime Minister Mazowiecki and other candidates to become Poland's first freely elected head of state in 63 years, and the first non-Communist head of state in 45 years.<ref name=institute2/> In 1993, he founded his own political party, the [[Nonpartisan Bloc for Support of Reforms]] (''BBWR''); the grouping's Polish-language acronym echoed that of [[Józef Piłsudski|Józef Piłsudski's]] "[[Nonpartisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government]]," of 1928–35, likewise an ostensibly non-political organization.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Revolution and Change in Central and Eastern Europe: Revised Edition|last1=East|first1=Roger|last2=Pontin|first2=Jolyon|year=2016|location=London/ New York|pages=37}}</ref>

During his presidency, Wałęsa saw Poland through [[privatization]] and transition to a [[free market|free-market economy]] (the [[Balcerowicz Plan]]), Poland's 1991 first completely free [[1991 Polish parliamentary election|parliamentary elections]], and a period of redefinition of [[Foreign relations of Poland|the country's foreign relations]].<ref name=CNNCwar/><ref name=britannica>"Lech Wałęsa," ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Retrieved 11 January 2010, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online: http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/634519/Lech-Walesa</ref> He successfully negotiated the withdrawal of [[Northern Group of Forces|Soviet troops from Poland]] and won a substantial reduction in foreign debts.<ref name=institute2/>

Wałęsa supported Poland's entry into [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]], both of which occurred after his presidency, in 1999 and [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|2004]], respectively.<ref name=institute2/> In the early 1990s, he proposed the creation of a sub-regional security system called ''NATO bis''. The concept was supported by right-wing and [[Populism|populist]] movements in Poland but garnered little support abroad; Poland's neighbors, some of which (e.g. [[Lithuania]]), had recently regained independence and tended to see the proposal as Polish [[neo-imperialism]].<ref name=ash/><ref name="Wohlefeld">Monika Wohlefeld, 1996, [http://www.nato.int/acad/fellow/94-96/wohlfeld/home.htm "Security Cooperation in Central Europe: Polish Views].

Despite the 2000 ruling of a special [[lustration]] court affirming his innocence, for many years there have been allegations that Wałęsa was an informant of [[Służba Bezpieczeństwa]], the communist security services, in his twenties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Lech-Walesa|title=Lech Walesa {{!}} Biography, Solidarity, Nobel Prize, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> While vehemently denying being a regular SB informer, Wałęsa admitted to "signing something under interrogation in the 1970s."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/polishrevolution00timo|title=The Polish revolution : Solidarity|last=Garton Ash, Timothy.|date=2002|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0300095686|edition=3rd|location=New Haven|oclc=50804967|url-access=registration}}</ref> In 2017, a handwriting study ordered by the government-controlled [[Institute of National Remembrance]] (INR), stated that signatures on several documents from the 1970s belonged to Wałęsa.<ref name="INR">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-poland-politics-walesa-idUSKBN15F16L|title=Institute says Poland's Walesa collaborated with Polish Security Service|date=31 January 2017|access-date=2 February 2017|work=[[Reuters]]}}</ref> The exact nature of Wałęsa's relationship with SB to this day remains a contentious question among historians.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2016/02/lech-walesa-law-and-justice-poland/471366/|title=Don't Panic About Poland|last=Karatnycky|first=Adrian|date=29 February 2016|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=21 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dzieje.pl/wideo/prof-dudek-ujawnienie-wspolpracy-l-walesy-z-sb-nie-obciaza-jego-wizerunku-jako|title=Prof. A.

The controversy resurfaced in 2008 with the publication of a book that purported to show that Wałęsa, codenamed ''Bolek'', had been an operative for the security services from 1970 to 1976.<ref name=Britannica/>

The question resurfaced again in February 2016, when the [[Institute of National Remembrance]] seized materials from the widow of [[Czesław Kiszczak|Chief of secret police gen. Czesław Kiszczak]], that were said to document Wałęsa's role as a spy for the security services.<ref name=Britannica>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Lech Wałęsa |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |url=http://global.britannica.com/biography/Lech-Walesa |access-date=23 February 2016 |date=18 February 2016}}</ref>

===Court ruling===
On 12 August 2000, Wałęsa, who was running a presidential campaign at the time, was cleared by the special [[Lustration in Poland|Lustration]] Court of charges that he collaborated with the Communist-era secret services and reported on the activities of his fellow shipyard workers, due to the lack of evidence.<ref name="NYT 2000">{{cite news |first=Steven |last=Erlanger |author-link=Steven Erlanger |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/21/world/polish-watchdog-nips-at-walesa-s-heels.html?pagewanted=all |title=Polish Watchdog Nips at Walesa's Heels |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=21 August 2000 |access-date=23 February 2016}}</ref> Anti-communists [[Piotr Naimski]], one of the first members of the Workers' Defense Committee that led to the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] trade union, and [[Antoni Macierewicz]], Wałęsa's former [[Interior minister|Interior Minister]], testified against him in the closed vetting trial. Naimski, who said he testified with a "heavy heart", expressed his disappointment that Wałęsa "made a mistake by not going openly to the public, and he has missed an important chance".<ref name="NYT 2000"/> According to Naimski, the court cleared Wałęsa on "technical grounds" because it did not find certain original documents—many of which had been destroyed since 1989—that offered sufficient proof that Wałęsa was lying.<ref name="NYT 2000"/>

In 1992, Naimski, as a head of the [[Urząd Ochrony Państwa|State Protection Office]], started the process of screening people suspected of being Communist collaborators in Poland.<ref name="NYT 2000"/> In June that year, he helped Antoni Macierewicz prepare a list of 64 members of the government and parliament who were named as spies in the police records; these included Wałęsa, then the Polish president.<ref name="NYT 2000"/> Wałęsa's name was included on the list after a wrenching internal debate about the virtues of honesty versus political discretion.<ref name="NYT 2000"/> In response to the publication of this list, President Wałęsa immediately engineered the fall of prime minister [[Jan Olszewski]] and the dismissal of Interior Minister Macierewicz.<ref>{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Engelberg |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/12/world/charge-of-spying-denied-by-walesa.html |title=Charge of Spying Denied by Walesa |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=12 June 1992 |access-date=26 February 2016}}</ref> A parliamentary committee later concluded Wałęsa had not signed an agreement with the secret police.<ref name="NYT 2000"/>

A 1997 Polish law made the vetting a requirement for those seeking high public office. According to the law, it is not a crime to have collaborated, but those who deny it and are found to have lied are banned from political life for ten years. The 2000 presidential election was the first use of this law.<ref name="NYT 2000"/>

The book also said that during his 1990–1995 presidency, Wałęsa used his office to destroy the evidence of his collaboration with secret police by removing incriminating documents from the archives.<ref name=Times/> According to the book, historians discovered that with the help of the state intelligence agency, Wałęsa, Interior Minister Andrzej Milczanowski, and other members of Wałęsa's administration had borrowed from the archives the secret police files that had connections to Wałęsa, and returned them with key pages removed.<ref name=Spiegel/><ref name=Wyborcza/> When it was discovered at the turn of 1995/96, the following prosecutorial inquiry was discontinued for political reasons despite the case attracting much public attention.<ref name=Justification/><ref name=Wyborcza/>

Sławomir Cenckiewicz also said that in 1983, when Wałęsa was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, the secret police tried to embarrass him and leaked information about Wałęsa's previous collaboration with the government.

==Cultural references==
Lech Wałęsa has been portrayed, as himself or a character based on him, in a number of feature and television films. The two most notable of them are:
* ''[[Walesa. Man of Hope]]'' (2013) is a biographical drama by [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning filmmaker [[Andrzej Wajda]] about the lives of Wałęsa ([[Robert Więckiewicz]]) and his wife [[Danuta Wałęsa|Danuta]] ([[Agnieszka Grochowska]]) from 1970 to 1989. It shows Wałęsa's change from a shipyard worker into a charismatic labor leader. The film was shot in the historical locations of the depicted events, including the former Lenin Shipyard. It won three awards, including ''Silver Hugo'' for Robert Więckiewicz at [[Chicago International Film Festival]] and a ''Pasinetti Award'' for [[Maria Rosaria Omaggio]] at [[Venice Film Festival]], and was nominated for five more awards.<ref>{{IMDb title|2113820|Walesa. Czlowiek z nadziei}}</ref>
[[File:Walesa film set.jpg|thumb|left|Shooting of ''[[Walesa. Man of Hope]]'' on the Solidarity Square in Gdańsk]]
* ''[[Man of Iron]]'' (1981) is another Andrzej Wajda film about the Solidarity movement. The main character, a young worker Maciej Tomczyk ([[Jerzy Radziwiłowicz]]) is involved in the anti-Communist labor movement. Tomczyk is clearly portrayed as a parallel to Wałęsa, who appears as himself in the movie. The film was made during the brief relaxation of censorship in Poland between the formation of Solidarity in August 1980 and its suppression in December 1981. Waida was awarded both the ''[[Palme d'Or]]'' and the ''[[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]]'' at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] for the film. In 1982, it was nominated for ''[[Academy Awards|Oscar]]'' as the ''Best Foreign Language Film'' and gained seven other awards and nominations.<ref>{{IMDb title|0082222|Czlowiek z zelaza}}</ref>

Both of these films were produced in Poland. In December 1989, [[Warner Bros.]] intended to produce a "major" movie about Wałęsa, to be made in 1990 and released in 1991.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://articles.latimes.com/1989-12-04/entertainment/ca-292_1_warner-bros |title=Warners Plans Major Film on Lech Wałęsa |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |agency=[[United Press International]] |date=4 December 1989 |access-date=1 March 2016}}</ref> The company paid Wałęsa a $1 million fee for the rights to produce a biopic.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1990-01-12/news/9001125125_1_lech-walesa-chico-mendes-warner-bros |title=Million Dollar Story |work=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |date=12 January 1990 |access-date=1 March 2016}}</ref> Although the movie was never made, this payment sparked controversy in Poland when five years later it emerged that Wałęsa concealed this income to avoid paying taxes on it.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1995/Walesa-Didn-t-Pay-Polish-Taxes-on-$1-Million-from-Warner-Bros-/id-721ef96d7f9400dc909469e3ef512a07 |title=Walesa Didn't Pay Polish Taxes on $1 Million From Warner Bros |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=16 November 1995 |access-date=29 February 2016}}</ref> The Gdańsk tax office initiated a tax fraud case against Wałęsa but it was later dismissed because the five-year [[statute of limitations]] had already run out.<ref>{{cite book |last=Easter |first=Gerald M. |date=2012 |title=Capital, Coercion, and Postcommunist States |publisher=[[Cornell University Press]] |page=157 |isbn=9780801465277}}</ref>

In 1982, [[Bono]] was inspired by Wałęsa to write [[U2]]'s first hit single, "[[New Year's Day (U2 song)|New Year's Day]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/new-year-s-day-u2 |title=New Year's Day |last=Fields |first=Gaylord |date=7 May 2012 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=29 February 2016}}</ref> Coincidentally, the Polish authorities lifted [[martial law]] on 1 January 1983, the same day this single was released. Wałęsa also became a hero of a number of Polish pop songs, including a satirical 1991 hit titled ''[[Nie wierzcie elektrykom]]'' (''Don't Trust the Electricians'') from the second studio album by the punk rock band [[Big Cyc]] which featured a [[caricature]] of Wałęsa on its cover.<ref>Big Cyc (1991). Nie Wierzcie Elektrykom. [CD] Poland: Polskie Nagrania Muza.</ref>

Wałęsa is ranked 11th on a scale of 1 to 21, with [[Augustus Caesar]] ranked as the best world leader of all time and [[Dan Quayle]] as the worst. Wałęsa is immediately outranked by [[Simon Bolivar]] and is ranked just above [[Ivan the Terrible]].  Lech Wałęsa ranks 9th out of 21 in [[Sid Meier]]'s ''[[Civilization VI]]'', immediately outranked by [[Marcus Aurelius]] and ranked just above [[Hatshepsut]].{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}
