==Biography==

Cherenkov was born in 1904 to Alexey Cherenkov and Mariya Cherenkova in the small village of Novaya Chigla.  This town is in present-day [[Voronezh Oblast]], [[Russia]].

In 1928,  he graduated from the Department of Physics and Mathematics of [[Voronezh State University]].  In 1930, he took a post as a senior researcher in the [[Lebedev Physical Institute]]. That same year he married Maria Putintseva, daughter of A.M. Putintsev, a Professor of [[Russian Literature]]. They had a son, Alexey, and a daughter, Yelena.

Cherenkov was promoted to section leader, and in 1940 was awarded the degree of Doctor of Physico-Mathematical Sciences. In 1953, he was confirmed as Professor of Experimental Physics. Starting in 1959, he headed the institute's [[photo-meson]] processes laboratory. He remained a professor for fourteen years. In 1970, he became an Academician of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]].

Cherenkov died in [[Moscow]] on January 6, 1990, and was buried  in [[Novodevichy Cemetery]].

==Discoveries in physics==
[[File:Advanced Test Reactor.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Cherenkov radiation]] is named for his discovery of the phenomenon; pictured here glowing is the core of the [[Advanced Test Reactor]].]]
In 1934, while working under [[S. I. Vavilov]], Cherenkov observed the emission of blue light from a bottle of water subjected to radioactive bombardment. This phenomenon, associated with charged [[Particle physics|atomic particle]]s moving at [[velocities]] greater than the [[phase velocity]] of light, proved to be of great importance in subsequent experimental work in [[nuclear physics]], and for the study of [[cosmic ray]]s. Eponymously, it was dubbed the  [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov effect]], as was the [[Cherenkov detector]], which has become a standard piece of equipment in atomic research for observing the existence and velocity of high-speed particles. The device was installed in [[Sputnik 3]].

Pavel Cherenkov also shared in the development and construction of [[Particle accelerator|electron accelerators]] and in the investigation of photo-nuclear and [[photo-meson]] reactions.

==Awards and honours==
Cherenkov was awarded two [[State Stalin Prize|Stalin Prize]]s, the first in 1946, sharing the honor with Vavilov, [[Ilya Frank|Frank]] and [[Igor Yevgenyevich Tamm|Tamm]], and another in 1952. He was also awarded the [[USSR State Prize]] in 1977. In 1958, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for the discovery of the Cherenkov effect.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1958/cerenkov-bio.html |title = The Nobel Prize in Physics 1958}}</ref> He was also awarded the Soviet Union's [[Hero of Socialist Labour]] title in 1984. Cherenkov was a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].

==In popular culture==
The novel [[Ghost Fleet (novel)| Ghost Fleet]] makes the claim that many believe the ''[[Star Trek]]'' character [[Pavel Chekov]] is named after Pavel Cherenkov.<ref>{{cite book | title = Ghost Fleet | author1 = P.W.

In ''[[Starship Troopers]]'' spaceships travel faster than light using Cherenkov Drive.
