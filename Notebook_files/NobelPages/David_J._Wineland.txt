==Early life and career==
Wineland was born in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin. He lived in Denver until he was three years old, at which time his family moved to [[Sacramento, California]].<ref name=NIST-PR>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/wineland-nobel-release.cfm|title=NIST's David J.

He received his bachelor's degree in physics from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1965 and his master's and doctoral degrees in physics from [[Harvard University]].<ref name=NIST-PR/> He completed his PhD in 1970, supervised by [[Norman Foster Ramsey, Jr.]]<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Wineland | first1 = D.

He then performed postdoctoral research in [[Hans Dehmelt]]'s group at the [[University of Washington]] where he investigated electrons in [[ion trap]]s.  In 1975, he joined the National Bureau of Standards (now called [[NIST]]), where he started the ion storage group and is on the physics faculty of the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]]. In January 2018, Wineland moved to the Department of Physics [[University of Oregon]]  as a [[Philip H. Knight Chairs and Professorships|Knight Research Professor]],<ref>{{cite news|last1=Thornberry|first1=Max|title=Nobel Prize winner set to join UO faculty|url=http://www.dailyemerald.com/2017/08/01/nobel-prize-winner-set-join-uo-faculty/|access-date=1 August 2017|publisher=The Daily Emerald}}</ref> while still being engaged with the Ion Storage Group at NIST in a consulting role.

Wineland was the first to laser-cool ions in 1978.  His NIST group uses trapped ions in many experiments on fundamental physics, and quantum state control.  They have demonstrated optical techniques to prepare ground, superposition and entangled states. This work has led to advances in spectroscopy, [[atomic clock]]s and quantum information.  In 1995 he created the first single atom quantum logic gate and was the first to quantum teleport information in massive particles in 2004.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://tf.boulder.nist.gov/general/pdf/2677.pdf|title = Nobel Lecture: Superposition, entanglement, and raising Schro¨dinger's cat*|date = July 12, 2013|journal = Rev Mod Phys|volume = 85|issue = 3|pages = 1103–1114|doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.85.1103|bibcode = 2013RvMP...85.1103W |last1 = Wineland|first1 = David J.|doi-access = free}}</ref> Wineland implemented the most precise atomic clock using quantum logic on a single aluminum ion in 2005.<ref>{{Cite journal|url = http://tf.nist.gov/general/pdf/2053.pdf|title = Spectroscopy Using Quantum Logic|date = July 29, 2005|journal = Science |volume=309|issue = 5735|pages = 749–52|doi = 10.1126/science.1114375|pmid = 16051790|bibcode = 2005Sci...309..749S|last1 = Schmidt|first1 = P.
