'''Eric Francis Wieschaus''' (born June 8, 1947 in [[South Bend, Indiana]]) is an [[United States|American]] [[Evolutionary developmental biology|evolutionary developmental biologist]] and 1995 Nobel Prize-winner.

==Early life==
Born in [[South Bend, Indiana]], he attended [[John Carroll Catholic High School (Birmingham, Alabama)|John Carroll Catholic High School]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] before attending the [[University of Notre Dame]] for his undergraduate studies (B.S., biology), and [[Yale University]] (Ph.D., biology) for his graduate work.

==Scientific career==

In 1978, he moved to his first independent job, at the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] in [[Heidelberg]], [[Germany]] and moved from Heidelberg to [[Princeton University]] in the [[United States]] in 1981.<ref>{{Nobelprize}}</ref><ref name="ew16">{{cite journal |pmid=27501451|year=2016|last1=Wieschaus|first1=E.|title=The Heidelberg Screen for Pattern Mutants of Drosophila: A Personal Account|journal=Annual Review of Cell and Developmental Biology|volume=32|pages=1–46|last2=Nüsslein-Volhard|first2=C.|doi=10.1146/annurev-cellbio-113015-023138|doi-access=free}}</ref>

Much of his research has focused on [[Drosophila embryogenesis|embryogenesis]] in the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', specifically in the patterning that occurs in the early ''Drosophila'' embryo. Most of the gene products used by the embryo at these stages are already present in the unfertilized egg and were produced by maternal transcription during [[oogenesis]]. A small number of gene products, however, are supplied by transcription in the embryo itself. He has focused on these [[zygote|"zygotically"]] active genes because he believes the temporal and spatial pattern of their transcription may provide the triggers controlling the normal sequence of embryonic development. Saturation of all the possible mutations on each chromosome by random events to test embryonic lethality was done by Eric Wieschaus.<ref>{{Citation|pmid=7580653|last=Connor|first=S.|publication-date=October 21, 1995|year=1995|title=Nobel prize given for work on fruit flies|volume=311|issue=7012|periodical=BMJ|pages=1044|doi=10.1136/bmj.311.7012.1044|pmc=2551360}}</ref> This body of science eventually was termed the ''[[Heidelberg screen]]''.<ref name=ew16/><ref name="stj">{{cite journal |pmid=11972155|year=2002|last1=St Johnston|first1=D.|title=The art and design of genetic screens: Drosophila melanogaster|journal=Nature Reviews.

In 1995, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] with [[Edward B. Lewis]] and [[Christiane Nüsslein-Volhard]] as co-recipients, for their work revealing the genetic control of embryonic development.<ref>{{Citation |pmid=8794677 |last=Gruenbaum

As of 2018, Wieschaus is the [[E. R. Squibb|Squibb Professor]] in [[Molecular Biology]] at Princeton.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eric Wieschaus {{!}} Squibb Professor in Molecular Biology|url=https://scholar.princeton.edu/wieschauslab/home|publisher=Princeton University|access-date=May 8, 2018}}</ref> He was formerly Adjunct Professor of Biochemistry at the [[University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey]] – [[Robert Wood Johnson Medical School]].

==Personal life==
He has three daughters and is married to molecular biologist [[Gertrud Schüpbach]], who is also a professor of [[Molecular Biology]] at [[Princeton University]], working on ''Drosophila'' oogenesis.{{cn|date=February 2021}}

Wieschaus is an atheist and is one of the 77 Nobel Laureates who signed the 2007 petition to repeal the [[Louisiana Science Education Act]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://dailyprincetonian.com/news/2007/04/nobel-winning-professor-tells-story-of-his-own-life-in-religion-science/|title=Nobel-winning professor tells story of his own life in religion, science|date=April 17, 2007|first=Tatiana|last=Lau|newspaper=The Daily Princetonian|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821162250/http://dailyprincetonian.com/news/2007/04/nobel-winning-professor-tells-story-of-his-own-life-in-religion-science/|archive-date=August 21, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.repealcreationism.com/397/nobellaureateletter/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=August 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528225453/http://www.repealcreationism.com/397/nobellaureateletter/ |archive-date=May 28, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
