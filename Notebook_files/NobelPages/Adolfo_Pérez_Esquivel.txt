His mother died when he was three, and despite his poverty, he attended the [[Manuel Belgrano]] School of Fine Arts and the [[National University of La Plata]], where he was trained as a painter and sculptor.<ref name=peace>{{cite web|url=http://www.peacejam.org/laureates/Adolfo-P%C3%A9rez-Esquivel-4.aspx |title=Adolfo Pérez Esquivel |publisher=Peace Jam |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924070128/http://www.peacejam.org/laureates/Adolfo-P%C3%A9rez-Esquivel-4.aspx |archive-date=24 September 2015 }}</ref> He was appointed professor of architecture and worked with a variety of [[sculpture|sculptural]] media, and for 25 years taught in all levels from primary to university. Pérez Esquivel began working with popularly based [[Latin America]]n [[Christian pacifism|Christian pacifist]] groups during the 1960s. He relinquished his teaching post in 1974, when he was chosen as coordinator general for a network of Latin America-based communities promoting [[Liberation Theology|liberation of the poor]] through [[non-violence]].<ref name=nobel>{{Nobelprize}}</ref>

When systematic repression followed the [[March 1976 coup]], which brought the dictatorship of General [[Jorge Videla]] to power, Pérez Esquivel contributed to the formation and financing of the linkages between popularly based organizations to defend [[human rights in Argentina]] and support the families of the victims of the [[Dirty War]]. The [[NGO]] ''[[Servicio Paz y Justicia]]'' ("Service, Peace and Justice Foundation", or SERPAJ), which he co-founded in 1974, and served as an instrument for the defense of human rights by promoting an international campaign to denounce the atrocities committed by [[Proceso de Reorganización Nacional|the military regime]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oas.org/EN/PINFO/WEEK/panelist.htm |title=Panelist:Adolfo Pérez Esquivel |publisher=OAS |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020220005124/http://www.oas.org/EN/PINFO/WEEK/panelist.htm |archive-date=20 February 2002 }}</ref> SERPAJ is a  member of the [[International Fellowship of Reconciliation]] (IFOR), which supported Esquivel's work from the beginning.<ref>On 17 November 1980, his wife, Amanda, wrote a letter to [http://ncronline.org/blogs/road-peace/hildegard-goss-mayr-greatest-living-peacemaker Hildegard Goss-Mayr], IFOR travelling secretary: "This [Nobel] prize will have to be woven with all those who have been for years in this difficult task of uniting and reconciling brothers. Although I never told you this, through your letters and personal contacts you have stimulated in one way or another the path that Adolfo has walked. He has always had you as his first teacher, who one distant day arrived in Buenos Aires, connected with the Ark, and explained in the most simple and humble way what nonviolence was... [with] your suggesting... the way to work and organize. You have always accompanied us in the good and bad moments. For that reason too, I believe you are also part of this prize".

Pérez Esquivel expressed himself regarding the historic, 13 March 2013, election of [[Archbishop of Buenos Aires]] Jorge Bergoglio as [[Pope Francis]], stating that as [[Provincial superior]] of [[Jesuit]]s "he had lacked the sufficient courage shown by other Bishops to support our cause for human rights during the dictatorship."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.infonews.com/2013/03/14/politica-65343-bergoglio-no-fue-complice-directo-de-la-dictadura-pero-no-tuvo-el-coraje-para-acompanar-nuestra-lucha.php|title=Bergoglio no fue cómplice directo de la dictadura pero no tuvo el coraje para acompañar nuestra lucha|work=InfoNews|date=14 March 2013}}{{Dead link|date=March 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Pérez Esquivel also said that "Bergoglio did what he could given his age at that time."<ref>[http://www.elmundo.es/america/2013/03/14/argentina/1363278494.html El Nobel de la Paz Pérez Esquivel defiende al Papa durante la dictadura]. elmundo.es. 14 March 2013.</ref> He, however, clarified that the future Pope "was no accomplice and had no links with the dictatorship" and that while "it is said he did not do enough to get two priests out of jail, I know personally that many bishops called on the military junta for the release of prisoners and priests and that these requests were not granted."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/126367/%E2%80%98bergoglio-had-no-links-with-the-dictatorship%E2%80%99-peace-nobel-prize-winner|title=Bergoglio had no links with the dictatorship, says Nobel Peace Prize winner|work=Buenos Aires Herald|date=14 March 2013}}</ref>
