'''Jack St. Clair Kilby''' (November 8, 1923 – June 20, 2005) was an American electrical engineer who took part  (along with [[Robert Noyce]] of [[Fairchild Semiconductor|Fairchild]]) in the realization of the first [[integrated circuit]] while working at [[Texas Instruments]] (TI) in 1958. He was awarded the [[List of Nobel laureates in Physics|Nobel Prize in Physics]] on December 10, 2000.<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2000/index.html The Nobel Prize in Physics 2000]. Nobelprize.org. Retrieved on 2013-11-21.</ref>  Kilby was also the co-inventor of the [[calculator|handheld calculator]] and the [[thermal printing|thermal printer]], for which he had the patents. He also had patents for seven other inventions.<ref name="IT Invention">{{cite web|title=The Chip that Jack Built|url=http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/kilbyctr/jackbuilt.shtml|publisher=IT Invention|access-date=27 May 2014}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Kilby was born in 1923 in [[Jefferson City]], Missouri to Hubert and Vina Freitag Kilby. Both parents had Bachelor of Science degrees from the University of Illinois. His father was a manager at a local utility company.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/jack-st-clair-kilby/12125|title=Jack St. Clair Kilby - Kansapedia - Kansas Historical Society}}</ref> Kilby grew up and attended school in [[Great Bend, Kansas]], graduating from the [[Great Bend High School]]. (Road signs at the entrances to the town commemorate his time there, and the Commons Area at Great Bend High School has been named The Jack Kilby Commons Area.)

Kilby received his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]], where he was an honorary member of [[Acacia Fraternity|Acacia fraternity]]. In 1947, he received a degree in [[electrical engineering]]. He earned his [[Master of Science]] in electrical engineering from the [[University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee]] in 1950,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uwm.edu/engineering/10-ways-uwm-engineers-improved-milwaukee-and-the-world/|title = 10 Ways UWM Engineers Improved Milwaukee and the World (July)}}</ref> while working at [[Centralab]], a division of [[Globe-Union]] corporation in [[Milwaukee]].

==Career==
In mid-1958, Kilby, a newly employed engineer at [[Texas Instruments]] (TI), did not yet have the right to a summer vacation. He spent the summer working on the problem in circuit design that was commonly called the "[[tyranny of numbers]]", and he finally came to the conclusion that the manufacturing of circuit components ''en masse'' in a single piece of [[semiconductor]] material could provide a solution. On September 12, he presented his findings to company's management, which included [[Mark Shepherd (businessman)|Mark Shepherd]]. He showed them a piece of [[germanium]] with an [[oscilloscope]] attached, pressed a switch, and the [[oscilloscope]] showed a continuous [[sine wave]], proving that his [[integrated circuit]] worked, and thus that he had solved the problem.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Das|first=Saswato R.|date=2008-09-19|title=Opinion {{!}} The chip that changed the world (Published 2008)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/19/opinion/19iht-eddas.1.16308269.html|access-date=2021-02-04|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> [https://www.google.com/patents/US3138743 U.S. Patent 3,138,743] for "Miniaturized Electronic Circuits", the first integrated circuit, was filed on February 6, 1959.<ref name=N00>{{cite web | title = The Nobel Prize in Physics 2000 | publisher = Nobel Foundation | url = http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2000/index.html|access-date=2011-07-14}}</ref> Along with [[Robert Noyce]] (who independently made a similar circuit a few months later), Kilby is generally credited as co-inventor of the integrated circuit.

Jack Kilby went on to pioneer military, industrial, and commercial applications of microchip technology. He headed teams that created the first military system and the first computer incorporating integrated circuits. He invented the handheld calculator (along with [[Jerry Merryman]] and [[James Van Tassel]]<ref>{{cite news |last1=Stengle |first1=Jamie |title=Jerry Merryman, co-inventor of handheld electronic calculator, dies at 86 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/jerry-merryman-co-inventor-of-handheld-electronic-calculator-dies-at-86/2019/03/07/801f910c-413c-11e9-922c-64d6b7840b82_story.html |access-date=8 March 2019 |work=The Washington Post |date=March 7, 2019}}</ref>). He was also responsible for the thermal printer that was used in early portable data terminals.

In 1970, he took a leave of absence from TI to work as an independent inventor. He explored, among other subjects, the use of silicon technology for generating electrical power from sunlight. From 1978 to 1984 he held the position of Distinguished Professor of Electrical Engineering at [[Texas A&M University]].

In 1983, Kilby retired from Texas Instruments.

==Legacy==

He died of cancer June 20, 2005 at the age of 81, in [[Dallas, Texas]].

On December 14, 2005, [[Texas Instruments]] created the Historic TI Archives. The Jack Kilby family donated his personal manuscripts and his personal photograph collection to [[Southern Methodist University]] (SMU). The collection will be cataloged and stored at DeGolyer Library, SMU.

In 2008, the [[Southern Methodist University|SMU]] School of Engineering, with the DeGolyer Library and the Library of Congress, hosted a year-long celebration of the 50th anniversary of the birth of the digital age with Kilby's Nobel Prize-winning invention of the integrated circuit. Symposia and exhibits examined the many ways in which technology and engineers shaped the modern world. Kilby held an honorary doctorate of science from SMU and was a longtime associate of SMU through the Kilby Foundation.

==Awards and honors==

Recognition of Kilby's outstanding achievements have been made by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE), including the election to [[IEEE Fellow]] in 1966, the [[IEEE David Sarnoff Award]] in 1966,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ieee.org/documents/sarnoff_rl.pdf |title=IEEE David Sarnoff Award Recipients |publisher=[[IEEE]] |access-date={{Format date|2011|12|6}}}}</ref> co-recipient of the first [[IEEE Cledo Brunetti Award]] in 1978,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ieee.org/documents/brunetti_rl.pdf |title=IEEE Cledo Brunetti Award Recipients |publisher=IEEE |access-date={{Format date|2011|12|6}}}}</ref> the [[IEEE Centennial Medal]] in 1984 and the [[IEEE Medal of Honor]] in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ieee.org/documents/moh_rl.pdf |title=IEEE Medal of Honor Recipients |publisher=IEEE |access-date={{Format date|2011|12|6}} |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150422004457/http://www.ieee.org/documents/moh_rl.pdf |archive-date=2015-04-22 }}</ref> He was co-recipient of the [[Franklin Institute]]’s [[Stuart Ballantine Medal]] in 1966.<ref name="BallantineMedal_Laureates">{{cite web |url=http://www.fi.edu/winners/show_results.faw?gs=&ln=&fn=&keyword=&subject=&award=BAL++&sy=1965&ey=1967&name=Submit |title=Franklin Laureate Database – Stuart Ballantine Medal 1966 Laureates |publisher=[[Franklin Institute]] |access-date={{Format date|2011|12|6}} |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121210143948/http://www.fi.edu/winners/show_results.faw?gs=&ln=&fn=&keyword=&subject=&award=BAL++&sy=1965&ey=1967&name=Submit |archive-date=2012-12-10 }}</ref> In 1982 and 1989, he received the Holley Medal from the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asme.org/about-asme/honors-awards/achievement-awards/holley-medal |title=Holley Medal |publisher=[[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] |access-date={{Format date|2011|12|6}}}}</ref> He was elected to member of the [[National Academy of Engineering]] (NAE) in 1967<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nae.edu/MembersSection/Directory20412/29087.aspx |title=NAE Members Directory – Mr. Jack S.
