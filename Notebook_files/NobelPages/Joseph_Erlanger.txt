'''Joseph Erlanger''' (January 5, 1874 – December 5, 1965) was an [[United States|American]] [[physiology|physiologist]] who is best known for his contributions to the field of [[neuroscience]]. Together with [[Herbert Spencer Gasser]], he identified several varieties of [[nerve fiber]] and established the relationship between [[action potential]] velocity and fiber diameter. They were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1944 for these achievements.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1944 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1944/summary/ |website=NobelPrize.org |access-date=29 October 2020}}</ref>

==Biography==
Erlanger was born on January 5, 1874, at [[San Francisco, California]]. His family was [[Jewish]] and his parents both immigrated from the [[Kingdom of Württemberg]], [[Germany]] and met in California during the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]]. Joseph was the sixth of seven children born to the couple. He completed his [[Bachelor of Science]] in Chemistry from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1895. He then completed his M.D. in 1899 from the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], where he finished second in his class.{{sfn|Oakes|2000|p=214}}

Upon graduating, Erlanger interned at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] under [[William Osler]] and worked in a physiology laboratory. Erlanger also gave lectures at the school on digestion and metabolism. Erlanger also had an interest in [[cardiology]], specifically the way that excitation transferred from the [[atrium (heart)|atrium]] to the [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]] and researched with [[Arthur D. Hirschfelder|Arthur Hirschfelder]]. Erlanger developed and patented a new type of [[sphygmomanometer]] that could measure [[blood pressure]] from the [[brachial artery]].{{sfn|McComas|2011|p=77}} While working at [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]] in 1901, Erlanger published a paper on the digestive systems of canines. This paper caught the attention of [[William Henry Howell]], a [[physiology]] professor at [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine]]. Howell recruited Erlanger as an Assistant Professor. Erlanger was promoted to Associate Professor some time before 1906.{{sfn|Oakes|2000|p=214}}

In 1906, Erlanger accepted a position as the first chair of physiology at the [[University of Wisconsin]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]]. In 1910, he left to take a position as professor at [[Washington University in St. Louis]]; the St. Louis position offered Erlanger more funding for his projects. [[Herbert Spencer Gasser]], Erlanger's former student at Wisconsin, joined Erlanger's laboratory soon after the move. During [[World War I]], the pair contributed to the research effort examining the effects of [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]].{{sfn|McComas|2011|p=79}} As part of this work, Erlanger was able to produce [[heart block]] in an animal model by clamping the [[bundle of His]] and tightening it.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jeffrey|first=Kris|title=Machines in Our Hearts: The Cardiac Pacemaker, the Implantable Defibrillator, and American Health Care|year=2001|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|place=Baltimore, MD|isbn=978-0801865794}}</ref> Together, they managed to amplify the [[action potential]] of a [[bullfrog]] [[sciatic nerve]] in 1922 and published the results in the ''[[American Journal of Physiology]]''.{{sfn|Oakes|2000|p=214}}{{sfn|McComas|2011|p=84}} It is uncertain why the pair had such a sudden shift in interest to [[neuroscience]], as Erlanger was already widely respected in the cardiology field.{{sfn|McComas|2011|p=80}}

Erlanger and Gasser were able to modify a [[Western Electric]] [[oscilloscope]] to run at low voltages. Prior to this modification, the only method available to measure neural activity was the [[electroencephalography|electroencephalograph]], which could only show large-scale electrical activity. With this technology, they were able to observe that action potentials occurred in two phases—a spike (initial surge) followed by an after-spike (a sequence of slow changes in potential).{{sfn|Oakes|2000|p=266}} They discovered that [[neuron]]s were found in many forms, each with their own potential for excitability. With this research, the pair discovered that the velocity of action potentials was directly proportional to the diameter of the nerve fiber. The partnership ended in 1931, when Gasser accepted a position at [[Cornell University]].{{sfn|McComas|2011|p=93}} In 1944, they won the [[Nobel Prize]] in [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Medicine or Physiology]] for these discoveries.{{sfn|Oakes|2000|p=214}}

He died of heart disease on December 5, 1965 at [[St. Louis, Missouri]].{{sfn|Oakes|2000|p=214}} The [[Joseph Erlanger House]] in St. Louis was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] on December 8, 1976 as a building of national significance.<ref>{{NRISref|2008a}}</ref> On January 22, 2009, the [[International Astronomical Union]] named a [[Erlanger (crater)|crater]] on the [[moon]] after him.{{cn|date=January 2018}}
