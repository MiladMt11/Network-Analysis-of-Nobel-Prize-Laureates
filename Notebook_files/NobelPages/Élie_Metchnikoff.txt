==Early life, family and education==
Mechnikov was born in the village [[:ru:Ивановка (Двуречанский район)|Ivanovka]], [[Kharkov Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]], now located in [[Kupiansk Raion]], [[Kharkiv Oblast]] in [[Ukraine]]. He was the youngest of five children of Ilya Ivanovich Mechnikov, an officer of the [[Imperial Guard (Russia)|Imperial Guard]].<ref name= nobelbio/> His mother, Emilia Lvovna (Nevakhovich), the daughter of the writer [[Löb Nevakhovich|Leo Nevakhovich]], largely influenced him on his education, especially in science.<ref name=encyclo>{{cite web|title=Metchnikoff, Elie|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Elie_Metchnikoff.aspx|website=Dictionary of Scientific Biography| access-date=16 March 2015}}</ref><ref name= "Life of" /> The Nevakhovich family was [[Jewish]].<ref name= nobelbio />The family name Mechnikov is a translation from [[Romanian Language|Romanian]], since his father was a descendant of the Chancellor [[Yuri Stefanovich Spătarul|Yuri Stefanovich]], the grandson of [[Nicolae Milescu|Nicolae Milescu Spataru]]. The word "mech" is a Russian translation of the Romanian "spadă" (sword), which originated with [[Historical Romanian ranks and titles|Spătar]] (Sword-bearer). His elder brother [[Lev Metchnikoff|Lev]] became a prominent geographer and sociologist.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= White |first1= James D|title=Despotism and Anarchy: The Sociological Thought of L. I. Mechnikov|journal=The Slavonic and East European Review| date= 1976 |volume= 54 |issue= 3 |pages=395–411|jstor=4207300}}</ref>

[[File:Leo Tolstoy & Ilya Mechnikov.jpg|thumb|left|[[Leo Tolstoy]] and Élie Metchnikoff]]

He entered Kharkov Lycée in 1856 where he developed his interest in biology. Convinced by his mother to study natural sciences instead of medicine, in 1862 he tried to study biology at the [[University of Würzburg]], but the German academic session would not start by the end of the year. So he enrolled at [[Kharkiv University|Kharkov Imperial University]] for [[natural sciences]], completing his four-year degree in two years. 

In 1864, he traveled to [[Germany]] to study marine [[fauna (animals)|fauna]] on the small [[North Sea]] island of [[Heligoland]]. He was advised by the botanist [[Ferdinand Cohn]] to work with [[Rudolf Leuckart]] at the [[University of Giessen]]. It was in Leuckart's laboratory that he made his first scientific discovery of [[alternation of generations]] (sexual and asexual) in [[nematodes]] and then at [[Munich Academy]]. In 1865, while at Giessen, he discovered intracellular digestion in [[trematoda|flatworm]], and this study influenced his later works. Moving to Naples the next year he worked on a doctoral thesis on the embryonic development of the cuttle-fish ''[[Sepiola]]'' and the crustacean ''[[Nebalia]]''. A [[cholera]] epidemic in the autumn of 1865 made him move to the [[University of Göttingen]], where he worked briefly with W. M. Keferstein and [[Jakob Henle]]. 

In 1867, he returned to [[Russian Empire|Russia]] to get his doctorate with [[Alexander Kovalevsky]] from the [[University of St. Petersburg]]. Together they won the Karl Ernst von Baer prize for their theses on the development of germ layers in invertebrate embryos.

==Career==
Mechnikov was appointed [[docent]] at the newly established [[Odessa University|Imperial Novorossiya University]] (now [[Odessa University]]). Only twenty-two years of age, he was younger than his students. After being involved in a conflict with a senior colleague over attending scientific meetings, he transferred to the University of St. Petersburg in 1868, where he experienced a worse professional environment. In 1870 he returned to [[Odessa]] to take up the appointment of Titular Professor of [[Zoology]] and [[Comparative Anatomy]].<ref name=nobelbio/><ref name=encyclo/>

In 1882 he resigned from Odessa University due to political turmoils after the [[Alexander II of Russia|assassination of Alexander II]]. He went to [[Sicily]] to set up his private laboratory in [[Messina]]. He returned to Odessa as director of an institute set up to carry out [[Louis Pasteur]]'s [[vaccine]] against [[rabies]]; due to some difficulties, he left in 1888 and went to [[Paris]] to seek Pasteur's advice. Pasteur gave him an appointment at the [[Pasteur Institute]], where he remained for the rest of his life.<ref name=nobelbio/>

[[File:Elie Metchnikoff - Between ca. 1910 and ca. 1915 - LOC.jpg|thumb|Metchnikoff, c.1910–1915]]
Mechnikov became interested in the study of [[microbes]], and especially the [[immune system]]. At Messina he discovered [[phagocytosis]] after experimenting on the [[larva]]e of [[starfish]]. In 1882 he first demonstrated the process when he inserted small [[citrus]] thorns into starfish larvae, then found unusual cells surrounding the thorns. He realized that in animals which have blood, the white blood cells gather at the site of inflammation, and he hypothesised that this could be the process by which bacteria were attacked and killed by the white blood cells. He discussed his hypothesis with [[Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Claus]], Professor of Zoology at the [[University of Vienna]], who suggested to him the term "phagocyte" for a cell which can surround and kill pathogens. He delivered his findings at Odessa University in 1883.<ref name=nobelbio/>

His theory, that certain [[white blood cell]]s could engulf and destroy harmful bodies such as bacteria, met with scepticism from leading specialists including Louis Pasteur, [[Emil Adolf von Behring|Behring]] and others. At the time, most bacteriologists believed that white blood cells ingested pathogens and then spread them further through the body. His major supporter was [[Rudolf Virchow]], who published his research in his ''Archiv für pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie und für klinische Medicin'' (now called the ''[[Virchows Archiv]]'').<ref name=encyclo/> His discovery of these [[phagocytes]] ultimately won him the Nobel Prize in 1908.<ref name="nobel" /> He worked with [[Pierre Paul Emile Roux|Émile Roux]] on [[calomel]] (mercurous chloride) in ointment form in an attempt to prevent people from contracting the [[sexually transmitted disease]] [[syphilis]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Worms|first=Werner|date=1940|title=Prophylaxis of Syphilis by Locally Applied Chemicals.

In 1887, he observed that [[leukocytes]] isolated from the blood of various animals were attracted towards certain bacteria.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors =  Metchnikoff E | title = Sur la lutte des cellules de l'organisme contre l'invasion des microbes | journal = Ann. Inst. Pasteur | year = 1887 | volume = 1 | pages = 321 }}</ref> The first studies of leukocyte killing in the presence of specific antiserum were performed by Joseph Denys and Joseph Leclef, followed by Leon Marchand and Mennes between 1895 and 1898. Almoth E. Wright was the first to quantify this phenomenon and strongly advocated its potential therapeutic importance. The so-called resolution of the humoralist and cellularist positions by showing their respective roles in the setting of enhanced killing in the presence of [[opsonin]]s was popularized by Wright after 1903, although Metchnikoff acknowledged the stimulatory capacity of immunosentisitized serum on phagotic function in the case of acquired immunity.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Metchnikoff and the Origins of Immunology: From Metaphor to Theory|last=Tauber& Cherniak|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1991|isbn=0-19-506447-X|location=Oxford UK|pages=155}}</ref>

This attraction was soon proposed to be due to soluble elements released by the bacteria<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Grawitz P | title = unknown title | journal = Virchows Adz.

Some 85 years after this seminal observation, laboratory studies showed that these elements were low [[molecular weight]] (between 150 and 1500 [[Dalton (unit)]]s) N-formylated oligopeptides, including the most prominent member of this group, [[N-Formylmethionine-leucyl-phenylalanine]], that are made by a variety of replicating [[gram positive bacteria]] and [[gram negative bacteria]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ward PA, Lepow IH, Newman LJ | title = Bacterial factors chemotactic for polymorphonuclear leukocytes | journal = The American Journal of Pathology | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 725–36 | date = Apr 1968 | pmid = 4384494 | pmc=2013377}}</ref><ref>J Exp Med. 1976 May 1;143(5):1154–69</ref><ref>J Immunol. 1974 Jun;112(6):2055–62</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schiffmann E, Showell HV, Corcoran BA, Ward PA, Smith E, Becker EL | title = The isolation and partial characterization of neutrophil chemotactic factors from Escherichia coli | journal = Journal of Immunology | volume = 114 | issue = 6 | pages = 1831–7 | date = Jun 1975 | pmid = 165239 }}</ref> Mechnikov's early observation, then, was the foundation for studies that defined a critical mechanism by which bacteria attract leukocytes to initiate and direct the [[innate immune response]] of acute [[inflammation]] to sites of host invasion by [[pathogens]].{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}

==Personal life and views==
[[File:I. Mechnikov by Nik. Dm. Kuznetsov (GIM).jpg|thumb|Portrait of Metchnikoff]]
Mechnikov was married to his first wife Ludmila Feodorovitch in 1869. She died from [[tuberculosis]] on 20 April 1873. Her death, combined with other problems, caused Mechnikov to unsuccessfully [[attempted suicide]], taking a large dose of [[opium]]. In 1875, he married his student Olga Belokopytova.<ref name="gordon">{{cite journal|last1=Gordon|first1=Siamon|year=2008|title=Elie Metchnikoff: Father of natural immunity|journal=European Journal of Immunology|volume=38|issue=12|pages=3257–3264|doi=10.1002/eji.200838855|pmid=19039772|doi-access=free|s2cid=658489}}</ref> In 1885 Olga suffered from severe [[typhoid]] and this led to his second suicide attempt.<ref name=nobelbio/> He injected himself with the [[spirochete]] of [[relapsing fever]].

Despite being baptized in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], Mechnikov was an [[Atheism|atheist]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tauber|first1=Alfred I.|last2=Chernyak|first2=Leon|title=Metchnikoff and the Origins of Immunology : From Metaphor to Theory: From Metaphor to Theory|date=1991|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York (US)|isbn=978-0-1953451-00|page=5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nfhpJ2Ri6KsC|quote=There is no clear record that he was professionally restricted in Russia because of his lineage, but he sympathized with the problem his Jewish colleagues suffered owing to Russian anti-Semitism; his personal religious commitment was to atheism, although he received strict Christian religious training at home.

He was greatly influenced by [[Darwinism|Charles Darwin's theory of evolution]]. He first read [[Fritz Müller]]'s ''Für Darwin'' (''For Darwin'') in Giessen.
