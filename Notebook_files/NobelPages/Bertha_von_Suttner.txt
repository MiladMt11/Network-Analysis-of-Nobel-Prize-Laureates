==Early life==
[[File:Bertha von Suttner 1860s.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Suttner in 1873]]
Suttner was born on 9 June 1843 at [[Kinský Palace (Prague)|Kinský Palace]] in the [[:cz:Obecní dvůr|Obecní dvůr]] district of [[Prague]].<ref>Hamann, p. 1</ref> Her parents were the Austrian [[Lieutenant general]] ({{lang-de|Feldmarschall-Leutnant}}) Franz Michael de Paula Josef Graf Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau (1769-1843), recently deceased at the age of 75, and his young wife Sophie Wilhelmine von [[Körner]] (1815-1884), who was almost fifty years his junior.<ref name="Hamann, p. 2">Hamann, p. 2</ref><ref>{{cite web|author1=Smith, Digby |author2=Kudrna, Leopold |title=Biographical Dictionary of All Austrian Generals During the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, 1792–1815: Kinsky von Wchinitz und Tettau, Franz de Paula Joseph Graf |publisher=napoleon-series.org |year=2008 |url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/biographies/Austria/AustrianGenerals/c_AustrianGeneralsK.html#K29 |author1-link=Digby Smith }}</ref> Her father was a member of the illustrious [[House of Kinsky]] via descent from [[Vilém Kinský|Count Vilém Kinský]]. Suttner's mother came from a family that belonged to untitled nobility of significantly lower status, being the daughter of her husband's comrade, Joseph von Körner, a [[Captain]] of the [[Cavalry]] in the [[Imperial Army (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Army]], distant relative of the poet [[Theodor Körner (author)|Theodor Körner]]. Through her mother, Bertha was also related to [[Theodor Körner (president)|Theodor Körner, Edler von Siegringen]], namesake and great-nephew of the poet, who later served as 4th [[President of Austria]].<ref>Kempf, pp. 7–8</ref> As well as film producer, writer and author Jason L. Koerner (born 1972). For the rest of her life, Suttner faced exclusion from the Austrian [[Uradel#Hochadel_(High_Nobility)|high nobility]] due to her mixed descent; for instance, only those with an unblemished aristocratic pedigree back to their great-great-grandparents were eligible to be presented at court. She was additionally disadvantaged because her father, as a third son, had no great estates or other financial resources to be inherited. Suttner was baptised at the [[Church of Our Lady of the Snows (Prague)|Church of Our Lady of the Snows]], not a traditional choice for the aristocracy.<ref name="Hamann, p. 2"/>

Soon after her birth, Suttner's mother moved to live in [[Brno]] near Bertha's guardian [[Landgrave]] Friedrich Michael zu [[Fürstenberg-Taikowitz]] (1793–1866). Her older brother Count Arthur Franz Kinsky (1827–1906) was sent to a military school, at the age of six, and subsequently had little contact with the family. In 1855, Suttner's maternal aunt Charlotte (Lotte) Büschel, ''née'' von [[:de:Körner (Familienname)|Körner]], who was also a widow and her daughter Elvira joined the household.<ref>Playne, p. 16</ref> Elvira, an orphan whose father was a private scholar and whose official guardian, after the death of her father, became [[:de:Johann Carl Huyn|Count Johann Carl August von Huyn]] was of a similar age to Suttner and interested in intellectual pursuits, introducing Suttner to literature and philosophy.<ref>Hamann p. 5</ref> Beyond her reading, Suttner gained proficiency in French, Italian and English as an adolescent, under the supervision of a succession of private tutors; she also became an accomplished amateur pianist and singer.<ref name="Hamann pp. 9-10">Hamann pp. 9–10</ref>

Suttner's mother and aunt considered themselves to be clairvoyant and thus went to gamble at [[Wiesbaden]] in the summer of 1856, hoping to return with a fortune. Their losses were so heavy that they were forced to move to [[Vienna]]. During this trip Suttner received a marriage proposal from Prince Philipp zu [[Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg]] (1836–1858), third son of [[Minister of State]] of the [[Duchy of Nassau]], [[:de:August Ludwig zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg|Prince August Ludwig zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg]] and Franziska [[:File:COA_Allesina-Schweitzer_Tyroff_BY.png|Allesina genannt von Schweitzer]] (1802-1878), which was declined due to her young age.<ref>Hamann pp. 5–6</ref> The family returned to Wiesbaden in 1859; the second trip was similarly unsuccessful, and they had to relocate to a small property in [[Klosterneuburg]]. Shortly after this, Suttner wrote her first published work, the novella ''Erdenträume im Monde'', which appeared in ''Die Deutsche Frau''. Continuing poor financial circumstances led Suttner to a brief engagement to the wealthy [[Gustav Heine von Geldern|Gustav, Baron Heine von Geldern]], 31 years her senior and member of the banking [[:de:Heine (Familie)|Heine family]], whom she came to find unattractive and rejected; her memoirs record her disgusted response to the older man's attempt to kiss her.<ref name="Hamann pp. 9-10"/>

In 1864, the family spent the summer at [[Bad Homburg]] which was also a fashionable gambling destination among the aristocracy of the era. Suttner befriended the Georgian aristocrat [[Ekaterine Dadiani, Princess of Mingrelia]], and met [[Tsar Alexander II]].<ref>Hamann p. 11</ref> Seeking a career as an opera singer as an alternative to marrying into money, Suttner undertook an intensive course of lessons, working on her voice for over four hours a day. Despite tuition from the eminent [[Gilbert Duprez]] in Paris in 1867, and from [[Pauline Viardot]] in Baden-Baden in 1868, she never secured a professional engagement. She suffered from [[stage fright]] and was unable to project well in performance.<ref>Playne, p. 29</ref><ref>Kemf, p. 9</ref><ref>Hamann p. 13</ref> In the summer of 1872 she was engaged to Prince Adolf zu [[Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein]] (1839–1872), son of [[:File:Alexander_zu_Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein.jpg|Prince Alexander zu Sayn-Wittgenstein-Hohenstein]] (1801–1874) and Countess Amalie Luise von [[Bentheim-Tecklenburg-Rheda]] (1802–1887), who died at sea that October, while travelling to America to escape his debts.<ref>Hamann p. 15</ref>

== Tutor in the Suttner household, life in Georgia ==
[[File:2013.07.28 Berta v. Suttner Schloss Harmannsdorf.jpg|Schloss Harmannsdorf in 2013|thumb]] 
Her cousin Elvira and Bertha's guardian [[Landgrave]] Friedrich zu [[House of Fürstenberg (Swabia)|Fürstenberg]] had both died in 1866, and Suttner, now above the typical age of marriage, felt increasingly constrained by her mother's eccentricity and the family's poor financial circumstances.<ref>Playne, p. 28</ref> In 1873, she found employment as a tutor and companion to the four daughters of Karl, [[:de:Suttner (Adelsgeschlecht)|Baron von Suttner]], who were aged between 15 and 20. The [[:de:Suttner (Adelsgeschlecht)|Suttner family]] lived in the [[Innere Stadt]] of Vienna three seasons of the year, and spent the summer at [[:de:Schloss Harmannsdorf|Castle Harmannsdorf]] in [[Lower Austria]]. She had an affectionate relationship with her four young students, who nicknamed her "Boulotte" (fatty) due to her size, a name she would later adopt as a literary pseudonym in the form "B. Oulot".<ref>Hamann pp. 18–19</ref><ref name="Playne, p. 45">Playne, p. 45</ref> She soon fell in love with the girls' elder brother, Baron [[:de:Arthur Gundaccar von Suttner|Arthur Gundaccar von Suttner]], who was seven years her junior. They were engaged but unable to marry due to his parents' disapproval. In 1876, with the encouragement of her employers, she answered a newspaper advertisement which led to her briefly becoming secretary and housekeeper to [[Alfred Nobel]] in [[Paris]].<ref>Hamann, p. 24</ref> In the few weeks of her employment, she and Nobel developed a friendship, and Nobel may have made romantic overtures.<ref>Hamann, p. 26</ref> However, she remained committed to Arthur and returned shortly to Vienna to marry him in secrecy, in the church of St. Aegyd in [[Gumpendorf]].<ref>Hamann, p. 27</ref>

The newlywed couple eloped to [[Principality of Mingrelia|Mingrelia]] in western Georgia, [[Russian Empire]], near the Black Sea, where she hoped to make use of her connection to the former ruling [[House of Dadiani]]. On their arrival, they were entertained by [[Niko I Dadiani|Prince Niko]]. The couple settled in [[Kutaisi]], where they found work teaching languages and music to the children of the local aristocracy. However, they experienced considerable hardship despite their social connections, living in a simple three-roomed wooden house.<ref name="Playne, p. 45"/><ref>Hamann pp. 30–31</ref> Their situation worsened in 1877 on the outbreak of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo-Turkish War]], although Arthur worked as a reporter on the conflict for the ''[[Neue Freie Presse]]''.<ref>Hamann, pp. 32–33</ref> Suttner also wrote frequently for the Austrian press in this period and worked on her early novels, including ''Es Löwos'', a romanticised account of her life with Arthur. In the aftermath of the war, Arthur attempted to set up a timber business, but it was unsuccessful.<ref>Hamann, pp. 34–37</ref>

== Arthur and Bertha von Suttner ==
Arthur and Bertha von Suttner were largely socially isolated in Georgia; their poverty restricted their engagement with high society, and neither ever became fluent speakers of [[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]] or [[Georgian language|Georgian]]. To support themselves, both began writing as a career. While Arthur's writing during this period is dominated by local themes, Suttner's was not similarly influenced by Georgian culture.<ref>Hamann, p. 37</ref>

In August 1882, Ekaterine Dadiani died. Soon afterwards, the couple decided to move to [[Tbilisi]]. Here Arthur took whatever work he could, in accounting, construction and wallpaper design, while Suttner largely concentrated on her writing. She became a correspondent of [[Michael Georg Conrad]], eventually contributing an article to the 1885 edition of his publication ''Die Gesellschaft''. The piece, entitled "Truth and Lies", is a polemic in favour of the naturalism of [[Émile Zola]].<ref>Kempf, pp. 15–16</ref><ref>Hamann, pp. 40–41</ref> Her first significant political work, ''Inventarium einer Seele'' ("Inventory of the Soul") was published in [[Leipzig]] in 1883. In this work, Suttner takes a pro-disarmament, progressive stance, arguing for the inevitability of world peace due to technological advancement; a possibility also considered by her friend Nobel due to the increasingly deterrent effect of more powerful weapons.

In 1884, Suttner's mother died, leaving the couple with further debts.<ref name="Hamann, pp. 42-43">Hamann, pp. 42–43</ref> Arthur had befriended a Georgian journalist in Tbilisi, M,<ref>Suttner could not recall the journalist's full name when writing her memoirs, and his identity is unknown.</ref> and the couple agreed to collaborate with him on a translation of the Georgian epic ''[[The Knight in the Panther Skin]]''. Suttner was to improve M.'s literal translation of the Georgian to French, and Arthur to translate the French to German.<ref name="Hamann, pp. 42-43"/> This method proved arduous, and they worked for few hours each day due to the distraction of the Mingrelian countryside around M.'s home. Arthur published several articles on the work in the Georgian press, and [[Mihály Zichy]] prepared some illustrations for the publication,<ref name="Hamann, pp. 42-43"/> but M. failed to make the expected payment, and after the [[Bulgarian Crisis (1885–88)|Bulgarian Crisis]] began in 1885 the couple felt increasingly unsafe in Georgian society, which was becoming more hostile to Austrians due to Russian influence. They finally reconciled with Arthur's family and in May 1885 could return to Austria, where the couple lived at [[Burgschleinitz-Kühnring|Harmannsdorf]] Castle in [[Lower Austria]].<ref>Hamann, p. 45</ref>

Bertha found refuge in her marriage with Arthur, of which she remarked that "the third field of my feelings and moods lay within our married happiness. In this was my peculiarly inalienable home, my refuge for all possible conditions of life, […] and so the leaves of my diary are full not only of political domestic records of all kinds, but also of memoranda of our gay little jokes, our confidential enjoyable walks, our uplifting reading, our hours of music together, and our evening games of chess. To us personally nothing could happen. We had each other – that was everything."<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Memoirs of Bertha Von Suttner: The Records of an Eventful Life.

==Peace activism==
After their return to Austria, Suttner continued her journalism and concentrated on peace and war issues, corresponding with the French philosopher [[Ernest Renan]] and influenced by the [[International Arbitration and Peace Association]] founded by [[Hodgson Pratt]] in 1880. 
[[File:Bertha von Suttner.png|thumb|left|Suttner in 1896]]
In 1889, Suttner became a leading figure in the peace movement with the publication of her pacifist novel, ''[[Die Waffen nieder!]]'' (''Lay Down Your Arms!''), which made her one of the leading figures of the Austrian [[peace movement]]. The book was published in 37 editions and translated into 12 languages. She witnessed the foundation of the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]] and called for the establishment of the Austrian ''Gesellschaft der Friedensfreunde'' pacifist organisation in an 1891 ''[[Die Presse|Neue Freie Presse]]'' editorial. Suttner became chairwoman and also founded the [[German Peace Society]] the next year. She became known internationally as the editor of the international pacifist journal ''Die Waffen nieder!'', named after her book, from 1892 to 1899. In 1897, she presented Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] with a list of signatures urging the establishment of an [[International Court of Justice]] and took part in the First [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Convention]] in 1899 with the help of [[Theodor Herzl]], who paid for her trip as a correspondent of the [[Zionist]] newspaper, [[Die Welt (Herzl)|Die Welt]].<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/13531049408576037 | volume=15 | issue=2 | title=Theodor Herzl and bertha von Suttner: Criticism, collaboration and utopianism | year=1994 | journal=Journal of Israeli History | pages=213–222 | last1 = Levenson | first1 = Alan T.}}</ref>

Upon her husband's death in 1902, Suttner had to sell Harmannsdorf Castle and moved back to Vienna. In 1904 she addressed the [[International Congress of Women]] in [[Berlin]] and for seven months travelled around the United States, attending a universal [[peace congress]] in [[Boston]] and meeting President [[Theodore Roosevelt]].

Though her personal contact with Alfred Nobel had been brief, she corresponded with him until his death in 1896, and it is believed that she was a major influence on his decision to include a peace prize among those prizes provided in his will, which she was awarded in the fifth term on 10 December 1905. The presentation took place on 18 April 1906 in [[Oslo|Kristiania]].

In 1907, Suttner attended the Second Hague Peace Conference, which however mainly pertained to the [[law of war]]. Around this time, she also crossed paths with [[Anna B. Eckstein|Anna Bernhardine Eckstein]], another German champion of [[world peace]], who influenced the agenda of the Second Hague Peace Conference. A year later she attended the International Peace Congress in London, where she first  met [[Caroline Playne]], an English anti-war activist who would later write the first biography of Suttner.<ref name=dnb>{{cite ODNB |author=Sybil Oldfield |title=Playne, Caroline Elizabeth (1857–1948) |year=2004 |url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/38530 |doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/38530}}</ref>

In the run-up to [[World War I]], Suttner continued to campaign against international armament. In 1911 she became a member of the advisory council of the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|Carnegie Peace Foundation]].<ref>{{EB1922|inline=1|title=Suttner, Bertha|volume=32|page=628|url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopdiabri32newyrich#page/628/mode/1up}}</ref> In the last months of her life, while suffering from [[cancer]], she helped organise the next Peace Conference, intended to take place in September 1914. However, the conference never took place, as she died of cancer on 21 June 1914, and seven days later the heir to her nation's throne, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Franz Ferdinand]] was killed, triggering World War I.

Suttner's pacifism was influenced by the writings of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Henry Thomas Buckle]], [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Charles Darwin]] and [[Leo Tolstoy]] (Tolstoy praised ''Die Waffen nieder!'')
<ref name="weop">''Bertha von Suttner'' by [[Irwin Adams]]. ''The World Encyclopedia of Peace''. Edited by [[Ervin László]], [[Linus Pauling]] and [[Jong Youl Yoo]]. Oxford: Pergamon, 1986. {{ISBN|0-08-032685-4}}, (vol. 3, pp. 201–204).</ref> conceiving [[peace]] as a natural state impaired by the human aberrances of [[war]] and [[militarism]]. As a result, she argued that a right to peace could be demanded under international law and was necessary in the context of an evolutionary [[Darwinism|Darwinist]] conception of history. Suttner was a respected journalist, with one historian describing her as "a most perceptive and adept political commentator".<ref name="weop" />

== Writing ==

As a career writer, Suttner often had to write novels and novellas that she did not believe in or really want to write, to support herself. However, even in those novels there are traces of her political ideals; often, the romantic heroes would fall in love upon realising they were both fighting for the same ideals, usually peace and tolerance.{{who said|date=December 2019}}

To promote her writing career and ideals, she used her connections in aristocracy and friendships with wealthy individuals, such as Alfred Nobel, to gain access to international heads of state, and also to gain popularity for her writing. To increase the financial success of her writing, she used a male pseudonym early in her career. In addition, Suttner often worked as a journalist to publicise her message or promote her own books, events, and causes.

As Tolstoy noted and others have since agreed, there is a strong similarity between Suttner and [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]]. Both Beecher Stowe and Suttner "were neither simply writers of popular entertainment nor authors of tendentious propaganda.... [They] used entertainment for idealistic purposes."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Braker|first=Regina|date=January 1991|title=Bertha von Suttner as Author: The Harriet Beecher Stowe of the Peace Movement|journal=Peace & Change|volume=16|pages=74–96|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0130.1991.tb00566.x}}</ref> For Suttner, peace and acceptance of all individuals and all peoples was the greatest ideal and theme.

Suttner also wrote about other issues and ideals. Two common issues in her work, apart from pacifism, are religion and gender.

=== Religion ===

There are two main issues with religion that Suttner often wrote about. She had a disdain for the spectacle and pomp of some religious practices. In a scene in ''Lay Down Your Arms'' she highlighted the odd theatricality of some religious practices. In the scene, the emperor and empress are washing the feet of normal citizens to show they are as humble as Jesus, but they invite everyone to witness their show of humility and enter the hall in a dramatic fashion. The protagonist Martha remarks that it was "indeed a sham washing."<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=Lay Down Your Arms|last=von Suttner|first=Bertha|publisher=CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform|year=2015|isbn=978-1514744314|pages=95–96}}</ref>

Another issue prominent in much of her writing is the idea that war is righteously for [[God]], and leaders often use religion as a pretext for war. Suttner criticised this reasoning on the grounds that it placed the state as the important entity to God rather than the individual, thereby making dying in battle more glorious than other forms of death or surviving a war. Much of ''Lay Down Your Arms'' discusses this topic.

This type of religious thinking also leads to segregation and fighting based on religious differences, which Bertha and Arthur von Suttner refused to accept. As a devout [[Christian]], Arthur founded the League Against Anti-Semitism in response to the pogroms in Eastern Europe and the growing [[antisemitism]] across Europe.<ref>{{Cite book|title=All her Paths were Peace: The Life of Bertha von Suttner|last=Longyel|first=Emile|publisher=Thomas Nelson Publishers|year=1975|isbn=978-0840764508|location=Scotland}}</ref> The Suttner family called for acceptance of all people and all faiths, with Suttner writing in her memoirs that "religion was neighbourly love, not neighbourly hatred. Any kind of hatred, against other nations or against other creeds, detracted from the humaneness of humanity."<ref name=":0" />

=== Gender ===

Suttner is often considered a leader in the women's liberation movement.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Braker|first=Regina|date=1995|title=Bertha von suttner's spiritual daughters: the feminist pacifism of Anita Augspurg, Lida Gustava Heymann, and Helene Stöcker at the International Congress of Women at The Hague, 1915|journal=Women's Studies International Forum|volume=18|issue=2|pages=103–111|doi=10.1016/0277-5395(95)80047-s|issn=0277-5395}}</ref> In ''Lay Down Your Arms'', the protagonist Martha often clashes with her father on this issue. Martha does not want her son to play with toy soldiers and be indoctrinated to the masculine ideas of war. Martha's father attempts to put Martha back in the female gendered box by suggesting that the son will not need to ask for approval from a woman, and also states that Martha should marry again because women her age should not be alone.<ref name=":1" />

This was not simply because she insisted that women are equal to men, but that she was able to tease out how sexism affects both men and women. Like Martha being placed in a female structured gender box, the character of Tilling is also placed in the male stereotyped box and affected by that. The character even discusses it, saying, "we men have to repress the instinct of self-preservation. Soldiers have also to repress the compassion, the sympathy for the gigantic trouble which invades both friend and foe; for next to cowardice, what is most disgraceful to us is all sentimentality, all that is emotional."<ref name=":1" />

== Legacy ==
Although Suttner was not financially successful during her lifetime, her work has remained influential for those involved in the peace movement.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}

She has also been commemorated on several coins and stamps:
* She was selected as a main motif for a high value collectors' coin: the [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2008 Europe Taler|2008 Europe Taler]], which featured important people in the history of Europe. Also depicted in the coin are [[Martin Luther]], [[Antonio Vivaldi]], and [[James Watt (inventor)|James Watt]].
* She is depicted on Germany's 2005 10 euro coin.
* She is depicted on the [[Austrian euro coins|Austrian 2 euro coin]], and was pictured on the old Austrian 1,000 schilling bank note.
* She was commemorated on a 1965 Austrian postage stamp and a 2005 German postage stamp.
* On 10 December 2019, [[Google]] celebrated her with a [[Google Doodle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/celebrating-bertha-von-suttner|title=Celebrating Bertha von Suttner|website=Google|date=10 December 2019}}</ref>
