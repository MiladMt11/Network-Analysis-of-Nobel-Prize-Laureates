==Education and early life==
Hitchings was born in [[Hoquiam, Washington]], in 1905, and grew up there, in [[Berkeley, California]], [[San Diego]], [[Bellingham, Washington]], and [[Seattle]]. He graduated from Seattle's [[Seattle Public Schools|Franklin High School]], where he was [[salutatorian]], in 1923, and from there went to the [[University of Washington]], from which he graduated with a degree in [[chemistry]] ''cum laude'' in 1927, after having been elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]] as a junior the year before. That summer, he worked at the university's [[Puget Sound]] Biological Station at [[Friday Harbor, Washington|Friday Harbor]] on [[San Juan Island]] [http://depts.washington.edu/fhl/], and received a master's degree the next year for his thesis based on that work.

From the University of Washington, Hitchings went to [[Harvard University]] as a teaching fellow, ending up at Harvard Medical School. Before getting his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1933,<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1988/hitchings/auto-biography/ Nobel Prize biography]</ref> he joined [[Alpha Chi Sigma]] in 1929.<ref>{{Citation

==Career and research==
Following his PhD, he worked at Harvard and [[Case Western Reserve University]]. In 1942, he went to work for Wellcome Research Laboratories at [[Tuckahoe (village), New York|Tuckahoe]], where he began working with [[Gertrude Elion]] in 1944. Drugs Hitchings' team worked on included [[2,6-diaminopurine]] (a compound to treat [[leukemia]]) and p-chlorophenoxy-2,4-diaminopyrimidine (a [[folic acid]] antagonist). According to his Nobel Prize autobiography,
:The line of inquiry we had begun in the 1940s [also] yielded new drug therapies for [[malaria]] ([[pyrimethamine]]), leukemia ([[6-mercaptopurine]] and [[tioguanine|thioguanine]]), [[gout]] ([[allopurinol]]), [[organ transplantation]] ([[azathioprine]]) and [[bacterium|bacteria]]l [[infection]]s ([[co-trimoxazole]] (trimethoprimA)). The new knowledge contributed by our studies pointed the way for investigations that led to major [[antiviral drug]]s for [[herpes]] infections ([[acyclovir]]) and [[AIDS]] ([[zidovudine]]).

In 1967 Hitchings became Vice President in Charge of Research of Burroughs-Wellcome. He became Scientist Emeritus in 1976. He also served as Adjunct Professor of Pharmacology and of Experimental Medicine from 1970 to 1985 at [[Duke University]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Weatherall|first1=Miles|title=Obituary: George Hitchings|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-george-hitchings-1151262.html|access-date=30 December 2015|publisher=The Independent|date=20 March 1998}}</ref> Hitchings died in 1998 in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]].  Hitchings founded the Triangle Community Foundation in 1983. Hitchings is a member of the Medicinal Chemistry Hall of Fame. His first wife, Beverly Reimer Hitchings, died in 1985.  Hitchings remarried in 1989 to Joyce Carolyn Shaver-Hitchings, MD. Dr. Shaver-Hitchings died in 2009. <ref>{{Cite news|url=http://giornaleitalianodinefrologia.it/en/2018/01/27/nobel-prize-winners-who-contributed-to-transplantation/|title=Nobel prize winners who contributed to Transplantation - GIN|date=2018-01-27|work=GIN|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}</ref>
