{{Nihongo|'''Takaaki Kajita'''|梶田 隆章|Kajita Takaaki|{{IPA-ja|kadʑita takaːki}}; born 9 March 1959}} is a Japanese [[physicist]], known for [[neutrino]] experiments at the [[Kamiokande]] and its successor, [[Super-Kamiokande]]. In 2015, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] jointly with Canadian physicist [[Arthur B. McDonald]]. On 1 October 2020, he became the president of the [[Science Council of Japan]].

==Early life and education==
Kajita was born in 1959 in [[Higashimatsuyama, Saitama]], Japan.<ref name="Nobel profile">{{cite web | url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2015/kajita-facts.html | title=Takaaki Kajita - Facts | publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]] | date=6 October 2015 | access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref> He liked studying thought rather than memorizing, especially with interest in [[physics]], [[organism]], world history, Japanese history, and [[earth science]] in high school. He studied physics at the [[Saitama University]] and graduated in 1981. He received his doctorate in 1986 at the [[University of Tokyo]].<ref name="Nobel-JPTimes">{{cite web | url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/10/06/national/jjapans-takaaki-kajita-shares-nobel-prize-in-physics/ | title=Japan's Takaaki Kajita shares Nobel in physics | publisher=[[Japan Times]] | date=6 October 2015 | access-date=7 October 2015}}</ref> At the University of Tokyo, he joined [[Masatoshi Koshiba]]'s research group because neutrinos "seemed like they might be interesting."

== Career and research ==
Since 1988, Kajita has been at the Institute for Cosmic Radiation Research, University of Tokyo, where he became an assistant professor in 1992 and professor in 1999.<ref name="Nobel-CBC">{{cite web | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/nobel-prize-physics-2015-1.3258178 | title=2015 Nobel Prize in Physics: Canadian Arthur B. McDonald shares win with Japan's Takaaki Kajita | publisher=[[CBC News]] | date=6 October 2015 | access-date=6 October 2015}}</ref>

He became director of the Center for Cosmic Neutrinos at the [[Institute for Cosmic Ray Research]] (ICRR) in 1999. {{As of|2017}}, he is a Principal Investigator at the [[Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe]] in Tokyo, and Director of ICRR.<ref>{{cite web |title=About ICRR |publisher=Institute for Cosmic Ray Research, University of Tokyo |url=http://www.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/about/greeting_eng.html}}</ref>

In 1998, Kajita's team at the [[Super-Kamiokande]] found that when [[cosmic ray]]s hit the Earth's atmosphere, the resulting neutrinos switched between two flavours before they reached the detector under Mt. Kamioka.<ref name="Nobel-JPTimes" /><ref name="NobelGuardian">{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/oct/06/kajita-and-mcdonald-win-nobel-physics-prize-for-work-on-neutrinos | title=Kajita and McDonald win Nobel physics prize for work on neutrinos | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=6 October 2015 | access-date=6 October 2015 | author=Randerson, James and Ian Sample}}</ref> This discovery helped prove the existence of [[neutrino oscillation]] and that neutrinos have mass. In 2015, Kajita shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] with Canadian physicist [[Arthur B. McDonald|Arthur McDonald]], whose [[Sudbury Neutrino Observatory]] discovered similar results.<ref name="NobelGuardian" /> Kajita's and McDonald's work solved the longstanding [[Solar neutrino problem]], which was a major discrepancy between the predicted and measured Solar neutrino fluxes, and indicated that the [[Standard Model]], which required neutrinos to be massless, had weaknesses.<ref name="NobelGuardian" /> In a news conference at the University of Tokyo, shortly after the Nobel announcement, Kajita said, "I want to thank the neutrinos, of course. And since neutrinos are created by cosmic rays, I want to thank them, too."<ref name="Nobel-NYT">{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/07/science/nobel-prize-physics-takaaki-kajita-arthur-b-mcdonald.html | title=Takaaki Kajita and Arthur McDonald Share Nobel in Physics for Work on Neutrinos | work=[[New York Times]] | date=6 October 2015 | access-date=6 October 2015 | author=Overbye, Dennis}}</ref>

One of the first people Kajita called after receiving the Nobel Prize was 2002 Nobel physics laureate [[Masatoshi Koshiba]], his former mentor and a fellow neutrino researcher.<ref name="Nobel-JPTimes" />

Kajita is currently the [[principal investigator]] of another ICRR project located at the [[Kamioka Observatory]], the [[KAGRA]] [[gravitational wave]] detector.<ref>{{cite press release |title=Professor Kajita won the novel prize in physics !! |url=http://gwcenter.icrr.u-tokyo.ac.jp/en/archives/1169 |date=7 October 2015 |quote=Professor Kajita, who is the PI of KAGRA, won the Nobel prize in physics !! |publisher=KAGRA collaboration}}</ref>
