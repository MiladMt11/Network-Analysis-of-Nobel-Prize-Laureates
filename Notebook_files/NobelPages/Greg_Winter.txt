==Education==
Winter was educated at the [[Royal Grammar School, Newcastle upon Tyne]].<ref name="whoswho" /> He went on to study [[Natural Sciences (Cambridge)|Natural Sciences]] at the [[University of Cambridge]] graduating from [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] in 1973. He was awarded a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] degree, from the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology, for research on the [[amino acid]] sequence of [[WARS (gene)|tryptophanyl tRNA synthetase]] from the bacterium ''[[Bacillus stearothermophilus]]'' in 1977<ref name=winteriscoming>{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |publisher=University of Cambridge |title=The amino acid sequence of tryptophanyl RNA synthetase from bacillus stearothermophilus |first=Gregory Paul |last=Winter |date=1976 |oclc=500591023 |url=http://ulmss-newton.lib.cam.ac.uk/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=15424 |id={{EThOS|uk.bl.ethos.477727}}}}</ref> supervised by [[Brian S.

Winter|website=kingfaisalprize.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-04}}</ref>

==Career and research==
Following his PhD, Winter completed [[postdoctoral research]] at the [[Laboratory of Molecular Biology]] in Cambridge.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.heptares.com/sab/ |title=Scientific Advisory Board |publisher=Heptares |access-date=5 April 2013}}</ref><ref name=googlescholar>{{Google scholar id}}</ref> He continued to specialise in protein and nucleic acid sequencing and became a Group Leader at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in 1981. He became interested in the idea that all antibodies have the same basic structure, with only small changes making them specific for one target. [[Georges J. F. Köhler|Georges Köhler]] and [[César Milstein]] had won the 1984 Nobel Prize for their work at the Laboratory of Molecular Biology, in discovering a method to isolate and reproduce individual, or monoclonal, antibodies from among the multitude of different antibody proteins that the immune system makes to seek and destroy foreign invaders attacking the body.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 1984 |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/1984/summary/ |website=NobelPrize.org |access-date=7 October 2018}}</ref> However, these monoclonal antibodies had limited application in human medicine, because mouse monoclonal antibodies are rapidly inactivated by the human immune response, which prevents them from providing long-term benefits.

Winter then pioneered a technique to "humanise" mouse monoclonal antibodies; a technique that was used in the development of [[Alemtuzumab|Campath-1H]]  by the Laboratory of Molecular Biology and University of Cambridge scientists.<ref>{{cite web |title=Therapeutic Antibodies - MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology |url=https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/research/technology-transfer/recent-technology-transfer-initiatives/therapeutic-antibodies/ |website=MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology |access-date=7 October 2018}}</ref> This antibody now looks promising for the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Humanised monoclonal antibodies form the majority of antibody-based drugs on the market today and include several blockbuster antibodies, such as [[Pembrolizumab|Keytruda]], which works with your immune system to help fight certain cancers.

Winter founded [[Cambridge Antibody Technology]] in 1989,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/group-leaders/emeritus/greg-winter/|title=Greg Winter|website=MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/industry-innovation/case-studies/winter/ |title = Sir Gregory Winter &#124; Royal Society}}</ref> and Bicycle Therapeutics.<ref>{{cite web |author=Gregory Winter |url=http://investing.businessweek.com/businessweek/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=23316112&privcapId=72510621&previousCapId=26322&previousTitle=CEPHALON%20INC |title=Gregory Winter: Executive Profile & Biography – Businessweek |work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |date=8 May 2001 |access-date=5 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bicycletherapeutics.com/ |title=www.bicycletherapeutics.com |publisher=bicycletherapeutics.com |date=10 December 2012 |access-date=5 April 2013}}</ref>

In 1989, Winter was a founder of [[Cambridge Antibody Technology]], one of the early commercial biotech companies involved in antibody engineering. One of the most successful antibody drugs developed was HUMIRA ([[adalimumab]]), which was discovered by Cambridge Antibody Technology as D2E7, and developed and marketed by [[Abbott Laboratories]]. HUMIRA, an antibody to [[TNF alpha]], was the world's first fully human antibody,<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1038/nbt0407-380 |pmid=17420735 |title=Billion dollar babies—biotech drugs as blockbusters |journal=[[Nature Biotechnology]] |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=380–2 |year=2007 |last1=Lawrence |first1=Stacy|s2cid=205266758 }} {{closed access}}</ref> which went on to become the world's top selling pharmaceutical with sales of over $18Bn in 2017<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hardmanandco.com/docs/default-source/newsletters/global-pharmaceuticals---2017-industry-stats---april-2018.pdf |title=Global Pharmaceutical 2017 Industry Statistics |access-date=3 October 2018 }}</ref> Cambridge Antibody Technology was acquired by [[AstraZeneca]] in 2006 for £702m.<ref>[http://www.astrazeneca.com/media/latest-press-releases/2006/5266?itemId=3891617 http://www.astrazeneca.com/media/latest-press-releases/2006/5266?itemId=3891617] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102190027/http://www.astrazeneca.com/media/latest-press-releases/2006/5266?itemId=3891617 |date=2 January 2010 }}</ref>

In 2000, Winter founded Domantis to pioneer the use of domain antibodies, which use only the active portion of a full-sized antibody. Domantis was acquired by the pharmaceutical [[GlaxoSmithKline]] in December 2006 for £230&nbsp;million.<ref name="domantis">{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/gsk-snaps-up-domantis-to-move-into-biotech-field-427735.html|title=GSK snaps up Domantis to move into biotech field|date=9 December 2006|website=The Independent}}</ref><ref>[http://www.mrc.ac.uk/Newspublications/News/MRC003436 GSK is to buy Domantis – a company based on discoveries by MRC scientists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116124659/http://www.mrc.ac.uk/Newspublications/News/MRC003436 |date=16 January 2014 }} LMB webpage</ref>
