==Early life and education==
[[File:Blackburn USE.png|thumb|Profile of Elizabeth Blackburn created by the organisation 'Science for All' as part of the UN's International Day of Women and Girls in Science]]

Elizabeth Helen Blackburn, one of seven children, was born in [[Hobart]], [[Tasmania]], on 26 November 1948 to parents who were both family [[Physician|physicians]].<ref name=":03">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/medicine/2009/blackburn/biographical/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine 2009|website=NobelPrize.org|language=en-US|access-date=10 December 2018}}</ref> Her family moved to the city of [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] when she was four, where she attended the Broadland House Church of England Girls' Grammar School (later amalgamated with [[Launceston Church Grammar School]]) until the age of sixteen. Upon her family's relocation to [[Melbourne]], she attended [[University High School, Melbourne|University High School]], and ultimately gained very high marks in the end-of-year final statewide matriculation exams.<ref>{{Harvnb|Brady|2007|pp=1–13}}</ref> She went on to earn a [[Bachelor of Science]] in 1970 and [[Master of Science]] in 1972, both from the [[University of Melbourne]] in the field of biochemistry. Blackburn then went to receive her [[PhD]] in 1975 from [[Darwin College, Cambridge|Darwin College]] at the [[University of Cambridge]], where she worked with Frederick Sanger developing methods to sequence DNA using RNA, as well as studying the bacteriophage [[Phi X 174]].<ref name=":03" /> It was also here, the Medical Research Council (MRC) Laboratory of Molecular Biology at Cambridge University, where Blackburn met her husband John Sedat.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Landau|first=Misia|date=1 April 2009|title=A Conversation with Elizabeth Blackburn|journal=Clinical Chemistry|language=en|volume=55|issue=4|pages=835–841|doi=10.1373/clinchem.2008.119578|issn=1530-8561|pmid=19233908|doi-access=free}}</ref> Blackburn's soon to be husband had taken a position at Yale, where she then decided to finish her postdoctoral.<ref name=":03" /> "Thus it was that love brought me to a most fortunate and influential choice: Joe Gall’s lab at Yale".

== Career and research==
During her postdoctoral work at Yale, Blackburn was doing research on the protozoan ''[[Tetrahymena thermophila]]'' and noticed a repeating [[codon]] at the end of the linear rDNA which varied in size'''''.'''''<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Valera|first=E|date=2010|title=2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine: telomeres and telomerase|journal=Oncogene|volume=29|issue=11|pages=1561–1565|doi=10.1038/onc.2010.15|pmid=20237481|s2cid=11726588}}</ref> Blackburn then noticed that this hexanucleotide at the end of the chromosome contained a TTAGGG sequence that was [[Tandem repeat|tandemly repeated]], and the terminal end of the chromosomes were palindromic. These characteristics allowed Blackburn and colleagues to conduct further research on the protozoan. Using the telomeric repeated end of ''Tetrahymena'', Blackburn and colleague Jack Szostak showed the unstable replicating plasmids of yeast were protected from degradation, proving that these sequences contained characteristics of telomeres.<ref name=":0" /> This research also proved the telomeric repeats of ''Tetrahymena'' were conserved evolutionarily between the species.<ref name=":0" /> Through this research, Blackburn and collaborators noticed the replication system for chromosomes was not likely to add to the lengthening of the telomere, and that the addition of these hexanucleotides to the chromosomes was likely due to the activity of an enzyme that is able to transfer specific functional groups.<ref name=":0" /> The proposition of a possible transferase-like enzyme led Blackburn and PhD student Carol W. Greider to the discovery of an enzyme with reverse transcriptase activity that was able to fill in the terminal ends of telomeres without leaving the chromosome incomplete and unable to divide without loss of the end of the chromosome.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|date=1 April 2010|title=The telomere story or the triumph of an open-minded research|journal=Biochimie|language=en|volume=92|issue=4|pages=321–326|doi=10.1016/j.biochi.2009.12.014|pmid=20096746|issn=0300-9084|last1=Gilson|first1=Eric|last2=Ségal-Bendirdjian|first2=Evelyne}}</ref> This 1985 discovery led to the purification of this enzyme in lab, showing the transferase-like enzyme contained both RNA and protein components.<ref name=":0" /> The RNA portion of the enzyme served as a template for adding the telomeric repeats to the incomplete telomere, and the protein added enzymatic function for the addition of these repeats.Through this breakthrough, the term "telomerase" was given to the enzyme, solving the end-replication process that had troubled scientists at the time.<ref name=":1" />

=== Telomerase ===
[[Telomerase]] works by adding base pairs to the overhang of DNA on the 3' end, extending the strand until DNA polymerase and an RNA primer can complete the complementary strand and successfully synthesize the double stranded DNA. Since DNA polymerase only synthesizes DNA in the leading strand direction, the shortening of the telomere results.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://embryo.asu.edu/pages/elizabeth-blackburn-carol-greider-and-jack-szostaks-telomere-and-telomerase-experiments-1982|title=Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider and Jack Szostak's Telomere and Telomerase Experiments (1982–1989) {{!}} The Embryo Project Encyclopedia|website=embryo.asu.edu|access-date=13 December 2018}}</ref> Through their research, Blackburn and collaborators were able to show that the telomere is effectively replenished by the enzyme telomerase, which conserves cellular division by preventing the rapid loss of genetic information internal to the telomere, leading to cellular aging.<ref name=":0" />

On 1 January 2016, Blackburn was interviewed about her studies, discovering telomerase, and her current research. When she was asked to recall the moment of telomerase discovery she stated:<ref name=":2">{{cite web|url=https://www.achievement.org/achiever/elizabeth-blackburn/#interview |title=Elizabeth Blackburn Interview|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]] |date=17 November 2009}}</ref><blockquote>[[Carol Greider|Carol]] had done this experiment, and we stood, just in the lab, and I remember sort of standing there, and she had this – we call it a gel. It's an [[autoradiogram]] because there were trace amounts of radioactivity that were used to develop an image of the separated DNA products of what turned out to be the telomerase enzyme reaction. I remember looking at it and just thinking, 'Ah! This could be very big. This looks just right.' It had a pattern to it. There was a regularity to it. There was something that was not just sort of garbage there, and that was really kind of coming through, even though we look back at it now, we'd say, technically, there was this, that and the other, but it was a pattern shining through, and it just had this sort of sense, 'Ah! There's something real here.' But then, of course, the good scientist has to be very sceptical and immediately say, 'Okay, we're going to test this every way around here, and really nail this one way or the other.' If it's going to be true, you have to make sure that it's true, because you can get a lot of false leads, especially if you're wanting something to work.<ref name=":2" /><br /></blockquote>In 1978, Blackburn joined the faculty of the [[University of California, Berkeley]], in the Department of Molecular Biology. In 1990, she moved across the San Francisco Bay to the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the [[University of California, San Francisco]] (UCSF), where she served as the Department Chair from 1993 to 1999 and was the Morris Herzstein Professor of Biology and Physiology at UCSF. Blackburn became a Professor Emeritus at UCSF at the end of 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://profiles.ucsf.edu/elizabeth.blackburn#toc-id2|title=UCSF Profiles: Elizabeth Blackburn, PhD|author=<!--Not stated-->|date=2018|website=ucsf.edu|publisher=The Regents of the University of California|access-date=11 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2015/11/258461/nobel-laureate-elizabeth-blackburn-named-president-salk-institute|title=Nobel Laureate Elizabeth Blackburn Named President of Salk Institute|last=Madhusoodanan|first=Jyoti|date=18 November 2015|access-date=11 June 2018}}</ref>

Blackburn, co-founded the company Telomere Health which offers telomere length testing to the public, but later severed ties with the company.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Marchant|first1=Jo|year=2011|title=Spit test offers guide to health|journal=Nature|doi=10.1038/news.2011.330}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.dallasnews.com/news/debunked/2016/11/22/89-test-kit-claims-determine-cells-aging-work|title=$89 test kit claims to determine how well your cells are aging.

In 2015, Blackburn was announced as the new President of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, California. "Few scientists garner the kind of admiration and respect that Dr. Blackburn receives from her peers for her scientific accomplishments and her leadership, service and integrity", says Irwin M. Jacobs, chairman of Salk's Board of Trustees, on Blackburn's appointment as President of the institute. "Her deep insight as a scientist, her vision as a leader, and her warm personality will prove invaluable as she guides the Salk Institute on its continuing journey of discovery".  In 2017, she announced her plans to retire from the Salk Institute the following year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.salk.edu/news-release/nobel-laureate-elizabeth-blackburn-named-salk-institute-president/|title=Nobel laureate Elizabeth Blackburn named Salk Institute president|website=Salk Institute for Biological Studies|language=en|access-date=12 December 2018}}</ref>

=== Nobel Prize ===
For their research and contributions to the understanding of telomeres and the enzyme telomerase, Elizabeth Blackburn, Carol Greider, and Jack Szostaks were awarded the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. The substantial research on the effects of chromosomal protection from telomerase, and the impact this has on cellular division has been a revolutionary catalyst in the field of molecular biology.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Herbert|first=Brittney-Shea|date=January 2011|title=The impact of telomeres and telomerase in cellular biology and medicine: it's not the end of the story|journal=Journal of Cellular and Molecular Medicine|volume=15|issue=1|pages=1–2|doi=10.1111/j.1582-4934.2010.01233.x|issn=1582-1838|pmc=3822486|pmid=21261810}}</ref> For example, the addition of telomerase to cells that do not possess this enzyme has shown to bypass the limit of cellular aging in those cells, thereby linking this enzyme to reduced cellular aging.<ref name=":5" /> The addition of telomerase, and the presence of the enzyme in cancer cells has been shown to provide an immunity mechanism for the cell in proliferating, linking the transferase activity to increased cellular growth and reduced sensitivity for cellular signalling. The importance of discovering this enzyme has since sent led her continued research at the University of California San Francisco, where she studies the effect of telomeres and telomerase activity on cellular aging.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=http://biochemistry2.ucsf.edu/labs/blackburn/index.php|title=Blackburn Lab Research|website=biochemistry2.ucsf.edu|access-date=14 December 2018}}</ref>

Blackburn was appointed a member of the [[President's Council on Bioethics]] in 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/01/20020116-9.html|title=President Names Members of Bioethics Council|website=georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov|access-date=16 March 2019}}</ref> She supported human embryonic cell research, in opposition to the Bush Administration.

Scientists and ethicists at the time even went as far to say that Blackburn's removal was in violation of Federal Advisory Committee Act of 1972, which "requires balance on such advisory bodies"<ref name=":22" />

"There is a growing sense that scientific research—which, after all, is defined by the quest for truth—is being manipulated for political ends," wrote Blackburn. "There is evidence that such manipulation is being achieved through the stacking of the membership of advisory bodies and through the delay and misrepresentation of their reports."<ref>[http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/350/14/1379 Bioethics and the Political Distortion of Biomedical Science] Elizabeth Blackburn, [[N Engl J Med]] 350:1379–1380 (1 April 2004)</ref><ref>[http://www.salon.com/tech/htww/index.html A Nobel prize for a Bush critic] By Andrew Leonard, Salon.com, 5 October 2009 Free text.

=== Publications ===
Blackburn's first book ''The Telomere Effect: A Revolutionary Approach to Living Younger, Healthier, Longer''<ref name="Blackburn 2017 p.

The book hones in on many of the effects that poor health can have on telomeres and telomerase activity.<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/how-maintaining-your-telomeres-can-help-you-agehealthily/article33618022/|title=How maintaining your telomeres can help you age healthily|access-date=14 December 2018}}</ref> Since telomeres shorten with every division of a cell, replenishing these caps is essential to long term cell growth. Through research and data, Blackburn explained that people that lead stressful lives exhibit less telomerase functioning in the body, which leads to a decrease in the dividing capabilities of the cell.<ref name=":3" /> Once telomeres shorten drastically, the cells can no longer divide, meaning the tissues they replenish with every division would therefore die out, highlighting the aging mechanism in humans. To increase telomerase activity in people with stress-filled lives, Blackburn suggests moderate exercise, even 15 minutes a day, which has been proven to stimulate telomerase activity and replenish the telomere.<ref name=":3" />

Blackburn states that unhappiness in lives also has an effect on the shortening of telomeres. In a study done on divorced couples, their telomere length was "significantly shorter" compared to couples in healthy relationships, and Blackburn states, "There's an obvious stressor... we are intensely social beings."<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/life/molecular-biologist-elizabeth-blackburn-reveals-telomere-effect/news-story/83a0b8c18b8476e30a421b96e52377d5|title=How to beat the march of time|date=5 February 2017|website=The Australian|access-date=14 December 2018}}</ref> She suggests positivity in daily life increases health. While increasing the amount of exercise, decreasing stress, tobacco use, and maintaining a balanced sleep schedule, Blackburn explains that telomere length can be maintained, leading to a decrease in cell aging.<ref name=":4" /> Blackburn also tells readers to be wary of clinical pills who proclaim to lengthen or telomeres and protect the body from aging. She says that these pills and creams have no scientific proof of being anti-aging supplements, and that the key to preserving our telomeres and stimulating telomerase activity comes from leading a healthy life.<ref name=":4" />

=== Current research ===
In recent years Blackburn and her colleagues have been investigating the effect of stress on telomerase and telomeres<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Epel ES, Lin J, Dhabhar FS, Wolkowitz OM, Puterman E, Karan L, Blackburn EH|year=2010|title=Dynamics of telomerase activity in response to acute psychological stress|journal=Brain, Behavior, and Immunity|volume=24|issue=4|pages=531–539|doi=10.1016/j.bbi.2009.11.018|pmc=2856774|pmid=20018236}}</ref> with particular emphasis on [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] meditation.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Jacobs TL, Epel ES, Lin J, Blackburn EH, Wolkowitz OM, Bridwell DA, Zanesco AP, Aichele SR, Sahdra BK, Maclean KA, King BG, Shaver PR, Rosenberg EL, Ferrer E, Wallace BA, Saron CD|year=2010|title=Intensive meditation training, immune cell telomerase activity, and psychological mediators|journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|volume=36|issue=5|pages=664–681|doi=10.1016/j.psyneuen.2010.09.010|pmid=21035949|s2cid=4890811}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author1=Elissa Epel|author2=Jennifer Daubenmier|author3=Judith Tedlie Moskowitz|author4=Susan Folkman|author5=Elizabeth Blackburn|year=2009|title=Can Meditation Slow Rate of Cellular Aging?

She also featured in the 2012 Emmy award-winning science documentary, 'Decoding Immortality' (also known as 'Immortal') by Genepool Productions.<ref>https://genepoolproductions.com/immortal/</ref>. Studies suggest that chronic psychological stress may accelerate ageing at the cellular level. Intimate partner violence was found to shorten telomere length in formerly abused women versus never abused women, possibly causing poorer overall health and greater morbidity in abused women.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Janice Humphreys|author2=Elissa S.

At the University of California San Francisco, Blackburn currently researches telomeres and telomerase in many organisms, from yeast to human cells.<ref name=":6" /> The lab is focused on telomere maintenance, and how this has an impact on cellular aging. Many chronic diseases have been associated with the improper maintenance of these telomeres, thereby effecting cellular division, cycling, and impaired growth. At the cutting edge of telomere research, the Blackburn lab currently investigates the impact of limited maintenance of telomeres in cells through altering the enzyme telomerase.<ref name=":6" />
