Besides his contributions to medicine, Krogh was also one of the founders of what is today the [[Novo Nordisk]] company.<ref name="Novo Nordisk" />

==Life==
He was born in [[Grenaa]] on the peninsula of [[Djursland]] in [[Denmark]], the son of Viggo Krogh, a shipbuilder. His mother was a [[Romani people|Romni]]. He was educated at the [[Aarhus Katedralskole]] in [[Aarhus]]. He attended the [[University of Copenhagen]] graduating MSc in 1899 and gaining a doctorate PhD in 1903.<ref>{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0-902-198-84-X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}</ref>

Krogh was a pioneer in [[comparative physiology]]. He wrote his thesis on the respiration through the skin and lungs in [[frog]]s: ''Respiratory Exchange of Animals'', 1915. Later Krogh took on studies of water and electrolyte [[homeostasis]] of aquatic animals and he published the books: ''Osmotic Regulation'' (1939) and ''Comparative Physiology of Respiratory Mechanisms'' (1941). He contributed more than 200 research articles in international journals. He was a constructor of scientific instruments of which several had considerable practical importance, such as the [[spirometer]] and the apparatus for measuring [[basal metabolic rate]].

Krogh began lecturing in the [[University of Copenhagen]] in 1908 and in 1916 was promoted to full professor, becoming the head of the first laboratory for animal [[physiology]] (zoophysiology)<!--Founded in 1910--> at the university.<ref name=NBI>{{cite web |title=George de Hevesy: Explosion of new knowledge |url=http://www.nbi.ku.dk/english/www/george_/de_hevesy/foerste_dokument/|publisher=Niels Bohr Institute |access-date=2 August 2016|date=2014-09-11}}</ref>

Krogh and his wife Marie brought [[insulin]] to [[Denmark]] shortly after its discovery in 1922 by [[Frederick Banting]] and [[Charles Best (medical scientist)|Charles Best]].<ref name="Bodil_S-N">{{cite book |last1=Schmidt-Nielsen |first1=Bodil |title=August and Marie Krogh : lives in science |date=1995 |publisher=American Physiological Society |location=New York |isbn=9780195090994}}</ref> Marie, a doctor who had patients with [[type 1 diabetes]], was herself suffering from [[type 2 diabetes]] and was naturally very interested in the disease.<ref name="Novo Nordisk">{{cite web |title=The Founders |url=http://www.novonordisk.com/about-novo-nordisk/novo-nordisk-history/the-founders.html |publisher=Novo Nordisk |access-date=2 August 2016 |archive-date=16 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160716194526/http://www.novonordisk.com/about-novo-nordisk/novo-nordisk-history/the-founders.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Together with a doctor, [[Hans Christian Hagedorn|Hagedorn]], August and Marie Krogh founded [[Novo Nordisk|Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium]], where Krogh made decisive contributions to establishing a Danish production of insulin by [[ethanol]] extraction of the hormone from the [[Pancreas|pancreatic gland]]s of [[pig]]s.<ref name="Novo Nordisk"/>

In the 1930s, Krogh worked with two other Nobel prizewinners, the radiochemist [[George de Hevesy]] and the physicist [[Niels Bohr]] on the permeability of membranes to [[heavy water]] and radioactive [[isotope]]s, and together, they managed to obtain Denmark's first [[cyclotron]] for experiments on animal and plant physiology as well as in dental and medical work.<ref name=NBI/>

==Family==
He married Marie Jorgenson in 1905. Much of Krogh's work was carried out in collaboration with his wife, [[Marie Krogh]] (1874–1943), a renowned scientist in her own right.<ref name=Nobel>{{cite web |title=August Krogh - Facts |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1920/krogh-facts.html |publisher=Nobelprize.org |access-date=2 August 2016}}</ref>

August and Marie had four children, the youngest of whom, [[Bodil Schmidt-Nielsen|Bodil]], was born in 1918. She too was a physiologist, and became the first woman president of the [[American Physiological Society]] in 1975.<ref name=BodilObit>{{cite web |url=http://www.the-aps.org/mm/Publications/Journals/Physiologist/Archive/2015-Issues/July-2015-Vol-58No-4/Obituary/Bodil-Schmidt-Nielsen-1918-2015-48th-APS-President |title=Obituary Bodil Schmidt-Nielsen (1918-2015) 48th APS President |last=Dantzler |first=William H. |date=July 2015 |access-date=December 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222212157/http://www.the-aps.org/mm/Publications/Journals/Physiologist/Archive/2015-Issues/July-2015-Vol-58No-4/Obituary/Bodil-Schmidt-Nielsen-1918-2015-48th-APS-President |archive-date=December 22, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Bodil married another eminent physiologist, [[Knut Schmidt-Nielsen]].<ref>''Living history of physiology: Bodil Schmidt-Nielsen'' (Prof. William Dantzler.

==Legacy==
[[Torkel Weis-Fogh]], an eminent pioneer on the study of [[insect flight]], was a student of August Krogh's. Together they wrote a classic paper on that subject in 1951.<ref name="classic">{{cite journal |last1=Krogh |first1=August |last2=Weis-Fogh |first2=Torkel |author-link2=Torkel Weis-Fogh |year=1951 |title=The Respiratory Exchange of the Desert Locust (Schistocerca Gregaria) before, During and After Flight |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Biology]] |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=344–357 |publisher=The Company of Biologists |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/28/3/344}}</ref>

Krogh's name is preserved in two items now named for him: 
* [[Krogh length]], the distance between [[capillaries]] which nutrients [[diffuse]] to, based on cellular consumption of the nutrients.<ref>Fournier, R. L. ''Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering''. Taylor & Francis, London, 1999.</ref><ref>[http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v6/n11/abs/nmat2022.html Choi et al. Microfluidic scaffolds for tissue engineering. Nature Materials (2007) vol. 6 pp. 908-915]</ref>
* [[Krogh's principle]], that "for... a large number of problems there will be some animal of choice, or a few such animals, on which it can be most conveniently studied."<ref>Bernard, Claude. ''Introduction à l'étude de la médecine expérimentale'', J.B. Baillière et Fils, Libraires de L'Académie Impériale de Médecine, 1865. pp. 400</ref>
