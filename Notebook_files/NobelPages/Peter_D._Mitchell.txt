He was appointed a research post in the Department of Biochemistry, Cambridge, in 1942, and was awarded a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in early 1951 for work on the mode of action of [[penicillin]].<ref name=phd>{{cite thesis |degree=PhD |first=Peter Dennis|last=Mitchell |title=The rates of synthesis and proportions by weight of the nucleic acid components of a Micrococcus during growth in normal and in penicillin containing media with reference to the bactericidal action of penicillin |publisher=University of Cambridge |date=1950 |url= http://hooke.lib.cam.ac.uk/cgi-bin/bib_seek.cgi?cat=man&bib=35260 }}</ref>

==Career and research==
In 1955 he was invited by Professor [[Michael Swann]] to set up a biochemical research unit, called the Chemical Biology Unit, in the Department of Zoology, at the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he was appointed a Senior [[Lecturer]] in 1961, then [[Reader (academic rank)|Reader]] in 1962, although institutional opposition to his work coupled with ill health led to his resignation in 1963.

From 1963 to 1965, he supervised the restoration of a [[Regency architecture|Regency]]-fronted Mansion, known as [[Glynn House]], at [[Cardinham]] near [[Bodmin]], [[Cornwall]] - adapting a major part of it for use as a research laboratory. He and his former research colleague, [[Jennifer Moyle]] founded a charitable company, known as Glynn Research Ltd., to promote fundamental biological research at Glynn House and they embarked on a programme of research on [[Chemiosmotic potential|chemiosmotic]] reactions and reaction systems.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Mitchell | first1 = P. | author-link = Peter D.

===Chemiosmotic hypothesis===
[[File:Oxiphos.png|thumb|243px|Oxidative phosphorylation]]
In the 1960s, [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] was known to be the energy currency of life, but the mechanism by which ATP was created in the [[mitochondria]] was assumed to be by [[substrate-level phosphorylation]]. Mitchell's [[chemiosmosis|chemiosmotic hypothesis]] was the basis for understanding the actual process of [[oxidative phosphorylation]]. At the time, the biochemical mechanism of ATP synthesis by oxidative phosphorylation was unknown.

Mitchell realised that the movement of ions across an [[electrochemical potential]] difference could provide the energy needed to produce ATP. His hypothesis was derived from information that was well known in the 1960s. He knew that living cells had a [[membrane potential]]; interior negative to the environment. The movement of charged ions across a membrane is thus affected by the electrical forces (the attraction of positive to negative charges). Their movement is also affected by [[chemical thermodynamics|thermodynamic forces]], the tendency of substances to [[diffusion|diffuse]] from regions of higher concentration. He went on to show that ATP synthesis was coupled to this [[electrochemical gradient]].<ref>{{Cite journal| first1 = P. | title = Coupling of Phosphorylation to Electron and Hydrogen Transfer by a Chemi-Osmotic type of Mechanism |url=http://www1.ci.uc.pt/pessoal/manolo/Mitchell.pdf| journal = Nature| last1 = Mitchell | author-link = Peter D. Mitchell| volume = 191 | pages = 144–148 | year = 1961| pmid = 13771349 | doi = 10.1038/191144a0|bibcode = 1961Natur.191..144M  | issue=4784| s2cid = 1784050 }}</ref>

His hypothesis was confirmed by the discovery of [[ATP synthase]], a membrane-bound protein that uses the potential energy of the electrochemical gradient to make ATP; and by the discovery by [[André Tridon Jagendorf|André Jagendorf]] that a pH difference across the [[thylakoid]] membrane in the [[chloroplast]] results in ATP synthesis.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jagendorf A. T. and E. Uribe|title=ATP formation caused by acid-base transition of spinach chloroplasts.|journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA|date=1966|volume=55|issue=1|pages=170–177|doi=10.1073/pnas.55.1.170|pmid=5220864|pmc=285771|bibcode=1966PNAS...55..170J|doi-access=free}}</ref>

==== Protonmotive Q-cycle ====
Later, Peter Mitchell also hypothesized some of the complex details of electron transport chains. He conceived of the coupling of proton pumping to quinone-based electron bifurcation, which contributes to the proton motive force and thus, ATP synthesis.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mitchell|first=Peter|date=1975-11-15|title=The protonmotive Q cycle: A general formulation|journal=FEBS Letters|language=en|volume=59|issue=2|pages=137–139|doi=10.1016/0014-5793(75)80359-0|pmid=1227927|s2cid=45494306|issn=1873-3468|doi-access=free}}</ref>

===Awards and honours===
In 1978 he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] "for his contribution to the understanding of [[Mitochondrion#Energy conversion|biological energy transfer]] through the formulation of the [[chemiosmosis|chemiosmotic theory]]."<ref>{{Nobelprize|accessdate=2020-10-11|name=Peter Mitchell}}} including the Nobel Lecture on December 8, 1978 ''David Keilin’s Respiratory Chain Concept and Its Chemiosmotic Consequences''</ref> He was elected a [[List of Fellows of the Royal Society elected in 1974|Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1974]].<ref name="frs"/><ref name="ejfwb">{{cite web|title=Fellowship of the Royal Society 1660-2015|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RVVZY00MZNrK2YCTTzVrbTFH2t3RxoAZah128gQR-NM/pubhtml|publisher=[[Royal Society]]|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015185820/https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RVVZY00MZNrK2YCTTzVrbTFH2t3RxoAZah128gQR-NM/pubhtml|archive-date=15 October 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>
