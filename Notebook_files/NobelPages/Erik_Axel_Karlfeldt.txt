'''Erik Axel Karlfeldt''' (20 July 1864 – 8 April 1931) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] poet whose highly symbolist poetry masquerading as regionalism was popular and won him the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] posthumously in 1931 after he had been nominated by [[Nathan Söderblom]], member of the [[Swedish Academy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/|title=Nomination Archive|website=NobelPrize.org}}</ref> It has been rumored that he had been offered, but declined, the award already in 1919.<ref>[http://www.karlfeldt.org/Karlfeldt/Nobelpriset.html Karlfeldtsamfundet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726213309/http://www.karlfeldt.org/Karlfeldt/Nobelpriset.html |date=26 July 2011 }} (Swedish).

==Biography==
Karlfeldt was born into a farmer's family in [[Karlbo]], in the province of [[Dalarna]]. Initially, his name was ''Erik Axel Eriksson'', but he assumed his new name in 1889, wanting to distance himself from his father, who had suffered the disgrace of a criminal conviction. He studied at [[Uppsala University]], simultaneously supporting himself by teaching school in several places, including [[Djursholms samskola]] in the [[Stockholm]] suburb of [[Djursholm]] and at a school for adults. After completing his studies, he held a position at the [[Royal Library of Sweden]], in Stockholm, for five years.

In 1904, Karlfeldt was elected a member of the [[Swedish Academy]] and held chair number 11. In 1905, he was elected a member of the Nobel Institute of the Academy, and, in 1907, of the Nobel Committee. In 1912, he was elected permanent secretary of the Academy, a position he held until his death.

[[Uppsala University]], Karlfeldt's alma mater, awarded him the title of [[Doctor of Philosophy|Doctor]] [[honoris causae]] in 1917.
