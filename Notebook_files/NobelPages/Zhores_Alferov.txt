He shared the 2000 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for the development of the semiconductor [[heterojunction]] for optoelectronics. He also became a politician in his later life, serving in the [[lower house]] of the [[Federal Assembly (Russia)|Russian parliament]], the [[State Duma]], as a member of [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|the communist party]] since 1995.

==Early life and education==
Alferov was born in [[Vitebsk]], [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]], [[Soviet Union]], to a [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] father, Ivan Karpovich Alferov, a factory manager, and a Jewish mother, Anna Vladimirovna Rosenblum.<ref name=lenta>{{cite news|script-title=ru:Алферов, Жорес|url=http://lenta.ru/lib/14177331/full.htm|work=Lenta|language=ru|date=24 December 2007|access-date=26 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Nobelprize}}</ref> He was named after French socialist [[Jean Jaurès]] while his older brother was named Marx after [[Karl Marx]].<ref name=lenta/> Alferov graduated from secondary school in Minsk in 1947 and started Belarusian Polytechnic Academy. In 1952, he received his B.S. from the [[Saint Petersburg State Electrotechnical University|V. I. Ulyanov (Lenin) Electrotechnical Institute]] (LETI) in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]]. Starting in 1953, Alferov worked in the [[Ioffe Institute|Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute]] of the [[Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union]]. From the institute, he earned several scientific degrees: a Candidate of Sciences in Technology in 1961 and a Doctor of Sciences in Physics and Mathematics in 1970.<ref name=brit/>

Alferov then served as the director of the Ioffe Institute from 1987<ref name=brit/> to 2003. He was elected a corresponding member of the [[Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union]] in 1972, and a full member in 1979. From 1989, he was Vice-President of the USSR Academy of Sciences and President of its [[Saint Petersburg]] Scientific Center. In 1995 he became a member of the [[State Duma]] on the list of the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]].

==Research==
Starting at Ioffe Institute in 1953, Alferov worked with a group led by Vladimir Tuchkevich, who became director of the Ioffe Institute in 1967, on planar semiconductor amplifiers for use in radio receivers.<ref name="Josephson2010">{{cite book|author=Josephson, Paul R. |title=Lenin's Laureate: Zhores Alferov's Life in Communist Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WcXxCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA44|date= 2010|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-29150-7}}</ref>{{rp|125–128}} These planar semiconductor amplifiers would be referred to as transistors in the present day. Alferov's contribution included work on germanium diodes for use as a rectifier.

In the early 1960s, Alferov organized an effort at Ioffe Institute to develop [[semiconductor]] [[heterostructures]]. [[Heterojunction|Semiconductor heterojunctions]] transistors enabled higher frequency use than their [[homojunction]] predecessors, and this capability plays a key role in modern mobile phone and satellite communications. Alferov and colleagues worked on [[Gallium arsenide|GaAs]] and [[Aluminium arsenide|AlAs]] [[III-V]] heterojunctions. A particular focus was the use of heterojunctions to create [[semiconductor lasers]] capable of lasing at room temperature. In 1963, Alferov filed a patent application proposing double-heterostructure lasers; [[Herbert Kroemer]] independently filed a US patent several months later.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Popov|first=Yuri|year=2004|title=On the history of the invention of the injection laser|journal=Physics-Uspekhi|volume=47|issue=10|pages=1068–1070|doi=10.1070/PU2004v047n10ABEH002077}}</ref><ref name="CaseyPanish1978">{{cite book|author1=Casey, Horace Craig |author2=Panish, M.

Then in 1968, Alferov and coworkers produced the first continuous-wave semiconductor heterojunction laser operating at room temperature.<ref name="Josephson2010"/>{{rp|163–167}} This achievement came a month ahead of [[Izuo Hayashi]] and [[Morton Panish]] of [[Bell Labs]] also producing a continuous-wave room-temperature heterojunction laser.<ref name=Hecht2004>{{cite book|last=Hecht|first=Jeff|title=City of light : the story of fiber optics|year=2004|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=9780195162554|pages=151–155|edition=Rev. and expanded }}</ref>

It was for this work that Alferov received the 2000 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] together with [[Herbert Kroemer]], "for developing semiconductor heterostructures used in high-speed- and optoelectronics".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2000/alferov/biographical/|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2000|publisher=Nobel Foundation|access-date=2 March 2019}}</ref>

In the 1960s and 1970s Alferov continued his work on the physics and technology of semiconductor heterostructures in his lab at the Ioffe Institute. Alferov's investigations of injection properties of semiconductors and his contributions to the development of [[laser]]s, [[solar cell]]s, [[LED]]s, and [[epitaxy]] processes, led to the creation of modern heterojunction physics and electronics.<ref name=":0" /> The development of semiconductor heterojunctions revolutionized semiconductor design, and had a range of immediate commercial applications including [[LEDs]], barcode readers and CDs.<ref name=":0" /> [[Hermann Grimmeiss]] of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards Nobel prizes, said: "Without Alferov, it would not be possible to transfer all the information from satellites down to the Earth or to have so many telephone lines between cities."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/965528.stm|title=Russian and Americans share hi-tech Nobel|date=10 October 2000|work=BBC News|access-date=26 June 2008}}</ref>

Alferov had an almost messianic conception of heterostructures, writing: "Many scientists have contributed to this remarkable progress, which not only determines in large measure the future prospects of solid state physics but in a certain sense affects the future of human society as well."<ref>[http://lib.semi.ac.cn:8080/tsh/dzzy/wsqk/selected%20papers/semiconductors/32-1.pdf Lib.semi.ac.cn] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707013108/http://lib.semi.ac.cn:8080/tsh/dzzy/wsqk/selected%20papers/semiconductors/32-1.pdf |date=7 July 2011 }} (PDF)</ref>

==Scientific administration==

In 1987, Alferov became the fifth director of the Ioffe Institute. In 1989, Alferov gained the administrative position of chairman of the Leningrad Scientific Center, now referred to as the St. Petersburg Scientific Center. In the Leningrad region, this scientific center is an overarching organization comprising 70 institutions, organizations, enterprises, and scientific societies.<ref name="Josephson2010"/>{{rp|196}} As a director and chairman, Alferov sought to ensure support for scientific research through a time of changing political and economic conditions.

Alferov worked to foster relationships between early educational institutions and scientific research institutions to train the next generation of scientists, citing [[Peter the Great]]'s vision for the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] to be organized with a scientific research core in close contact with a gymnasium (secondary school).<ref name="Josephson2010"/>{{rp|199}} In 1987, Alferov and colleagues at the Ioffe Institute established a secondary school in Saint Petersburg, the School of Physics and Technology, under the umbrella of the Ioffe charter. In 1997 Alferov founded the Research and Education Center at the Ioffe Institute and in 2002, this center officially became a new university, the [[Saint Petersburg Academic University]], after gaining a charter to award masters and PhD degrees. In 2009, the Saint Petersburg Academic University was reorganized to officially combine the secondary school, School of Physics and Technology, within the organizational structure of the university, closely linking scientific education to research.

In the 2000s, through his role in academic administration and in parliament, Alferov advocated for and worked to advance Russia's [[nanotechnology]] sector. The primary research charter of the [[Saint Petersburg Academic University]], which Alferov founded, was the development of [[nanotechnology]]. Alferov provided a consistent voice in parliament in favor of increased scientific funding. In 2006, Prime Minister [[Mikhail Fradkov]] announced the creation of a federal agency, [[Rusnano|Rosnanotekh]] to pursue nanotechnology applications.

==Political activity==
[[File:Vladimir Putin 12 October 2000-2.jpg|thumb|right|Alferov with [[Vladimir Putin]]]]

Alferov was elected to the Russian Parliament, the [[State Duma]], in 1995 as a deputy for the political party [[Our Home – Russia]], generally considered to be supportive of the [[Presidency of Boris Yeltsin|policies of President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]]. In 1999 he was [[1999 Russian legislative election|elected again]], this time on the list of the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]]. He was [[2003 Russian legislative election|re-elected]] in 2003 and [[2007 Russian legislative election|again]] in 2007, when he was placed second on the party's federal electoral list behind [[Gennady Zyuganov]] and ahead of [[Nikolai Kharitonov]], even though he was not a member of the party.<ref>[http://www.commersant.com/p802109/elections_/ Communists, Patriots Name Their Leaders] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722072804/http://www.commersant.com/p802109/elections_/ |date=22 July 2011 }}, Kommersant, 7 September 2007.</ref>

He was one of the signers of the [[Academicians' letter|Open letter to the President Vladimir V. Putin from the Members of the Russian Academy of Sciences against clericalisation]] of Russia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gazeta.ru/science/2019/03/02_a_12218221.shtml|title="Великий по всем меркам": умер Жорес Алферов|website=Газета.Ru|access-date=2 March 2019}}</ref> Alferov was an atheist and expressed objections to religious education.<ref>"Prominent Russians: Zhores Alferov". RT (TV network). Retrieved 21 April 2012. In public life the scientist was a strong supporter of communism, an atheist strongly objecting to advancement of religious education in Russia, and proponent of science and knowledge as the means to see a better future.</ref>

==Non-profit service==
Alferov served on the advisory council of [[CRDF Global]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Dr. Zhores I.
