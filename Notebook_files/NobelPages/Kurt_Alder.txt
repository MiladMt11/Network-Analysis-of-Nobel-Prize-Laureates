'''Kurt Alder''' ({{IPA-de|ˈkʊʁt ˈaldɐ|-|De-Kurt Alder.ogg}}; 10 July 1902 &ndash; 20 June 1958) was a [[German people|German]] [[chemistry|chemist]] and [[Nobel laureate]].

==Biography==
Alder was born in the industrial area of [[Königshütte]], [[Silesia Province|Silesia]] (modern day [[Chorzów]], [[Upper Silesia]], [[Poland]]), where he received his early schooling. Alder left the area when Königshütte became part of Poland in 1922. He studied chemistry at the [[University of Berlin]] from 1922, and later at the [[University of Kiel]] where his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] was awarded in 1926 for work supervised by [[Otto Diels|Otto Paul Hermann Diels]].

In 1930 Alder was appointed reader for chemistry at [[Kiel]], and promoted to lecturer in 1934. In 1936 he left Kiel to join [[IG Farben|I G Farben Industrie]] at [[Leverkusen]], where he worked on [[synthetic rubber]]. Then in 1940 he was appointed Professor of Experimental Chemistry and Chemical Technology at the  [[University of Cologne]] and Director of the Institute of Chemistry there. Throughout this time and despite the many obstacles to original research in Europe at the time, he continued a systematic program of investigations of his particular interests in the [[Organic synthesis|synthesis]] of [[organic compound]]s. In all he published more than 151 papers in this field.

In 1945 he worked closely with the inventor of [[EDTA]], [[Ferdinand Münz]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Paolieri |first=Matteo |date=December 2017 |title= Ferdinand Münz: EDTA and 40 years of inventions |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321552574 |journal=Bull. Hist. Chem. |publisher=ACS | volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=133–140}}</ref> In 1949 they published a paper together on [[diene]] synthesis and additions <ref>{{cite journal |last=Münz |first=Ferdinand | last2 = Alder | first2 = Kurt |date=1949 |title= Diensynthese und substituierende Addition beim Divinyl-methan-typus Addition von Maleinsäure-anhydrid an Pentadien-1,4 und an 1,4-Dihydro-benzol |journal=Justus Liebigs Ann. Chem. | volume=565 |pages=126–135|doi=10.1002/jlac.19495650113 }}.</ref>

Alder received several honorary degrees and other awards, most famously the 1950 Nobel Prize in Chemistry which he shared with his teacher Diels for their work on what is now known as the [[Diels–Alder reaction]]. The [[Moon|lunar]] [[Impact crater|crater]] [[Alder (crater)|Alder]] is named in his honour. The insecticide [[aldrin]], created through a Diels–Alder reaction, is also named after the scientist.

Alder died in June 1958, aged 55. The cause of his death is unknown,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/444/000100144/|title=NNDB}}</ref> however his body was found in his apartment in [[Cologne, Germany]] after two weeks. His niece, who found the body, stated that the odor of rotting flesh was so bad that she could smell it from the street outside. [[Gertrud Alder]] reported that her husband was incredibly distressed when she last saw him and often muttered the phrase "''Les Jardins du Souvenir''" (The Memory Garden) whilst writing out his research notes.
