'''Donald James Cram''' (April 22, 1919 &ndash; June 17, 2001) was an American [[chemistry|chemist]] who shared the 1987 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] with [[Jean-Marie Lehn]] and [[Charles J. Pedersen]] "for their development and use of molecules with structure-specific interactions of high selectivity." They were the founders of the field of [[host–guest chemistry]].

==Early life==
Cram was born<ref name = press_release/> and raised in [[Chester, Vermont]], to a [[Scotland|Scottish]] immigrant father, and a [[Germans|German]] immigrant mother. His father died before Cram turned four, leaving him the only male in a family of five. He grew up on [[Aid to Dependent Children]], and learned to work at an early age, doing jobs such as picking fruit, tossing newspapers, and painting houses, while bartering for piano lessons. By the time he turned eighteen, he had worked at least eighteen different jobs.<ref name=RollinsCramBio>{{cite web|url=http://tars.rollins.edu/chemistry/People/DCram.shtml|title=Donald J.

Cram attended the Winwood High School in Long Island, N.Y.<ref>

From 1938 to 1941, he attended [[Rollins College]], in Winter Park, Florida on a national honorary scholarship, where he worked as an assistant in the chemistry department, and was active in theater, chapel choir, [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], Phi Society, and Zeta Alpha Epsilon. It was at Rollins that he became known for building his own chemistry equipment. In 1941, he graduated from [[Rollins College]] with a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in Chemistry.<ref name=RollinsCramBio/>

In 1942, he graduated from the [[University of Nebraska–Lincoln]] with a [[M.S.]] in organic chemistry,<ref name = press_release/> with Norman O. Cromwell serving as his thesis adviser. His subject was "Amino ketones, mechanism studies of the reactions of heterocyclic secondary amines with -bromo-, -unsaturated ketones."<ref>[http://library.unl.edu/record=b2609724~S0 University of Nebraska Research Library entry]</ref>

In 1947, Cram graduated from [[Harvard University]] with a [[Ph.D.]] in [[organic chemistry]],<ref name = press_release/> with [[Louis Fieser]] serving as the adviser on his dissertation on "Syntheses and reactions of 2-(ketoalkyl)-3-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinones"<ref>[http://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/990038295450203941/catalog Harvard Library Hollis]</ref>

==Career==
From 1942-1945, Cram worked in chemical research at [[Merck & Co]] laboratories, doing penicillin research with mentor [[Max Tishler]].<ref name=RollinsCramBio/> Postdoctoral work was as an [[American Chemical Society]] postdoctoral fellow at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], with [[John D. Roberts]]. Cram was the originator of [[Cram's rule]], which provides a model for predicting the outcome of [[Nucleophile|nucleophilic attack]] of carbonyl compounds.<ref>''Studies in Stereochemistry. X.

[http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/abstract.cgi/jacsat/1952/74/i23/f-pdf/f_ja01143a007.pdf Abstract]</ref> He published over 350 research papers and eight books on organic chemistry, and taught graduate and post-doctoral students from 21 different countries.<ref name=RollinsCramBio/>

===Research===
[[File:Nitrobenzene bound within hemicarcerand from Chemical Communications (1997).jpg|thumbnail|Crystal structure of a nitrobenzene bound within a [[hemicarcerand]] reported by Cram and coworkers<ref>{{cite journal | journal = [[Chem. Commun.]] | year = 1997 | pages = 1303–1304 | title = Dissymmetric new hemicarcerands containing four bridges of different lengths |author1=Juyoung Yoon |author2=Carolyn B. Knobler |author3=Emily F. Maverick |author4=Donald J. Cram | doi = 10.1039/a701187c | issue = 14}}</ref>]] Cram expanded upon [[Charles Pedersen]]'s ground-breaking synthesis of [[crown ether]]s, two-dimensional [[organic compound]]s that are able to recognize and selectively combine with the ions of certain metal elements. He synthesized molecules that took this [[chemistry]] into three dimensions, creating an array of differently shaped molecules that could interact selectively with other chemicals because of their complementary three-dimensional structures. Cram's work represented a large step toward the synthesis of functional laboratory-made mimics of [[enzymes]] and other natural molecules whose special chemical behavior is due to their characteristic structure. He also did work in [[stereochemistry]] and [[Cram's rule of asymmetric induction]] is named after him.

===Professor===
Cram was named an [[Professor|assistant professor]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1947, and a professor in 1955. He served there until his retirement in 1987. He was a popular teacher, having instructed some 8,000 undergraduates in his career and guided the academic output of 200 [[Graduate school|graduate students]]. He entertained his classes by strumming his guitar and singing [[Folk music|folk songs]].<ref name=press_release>{{cite press release | title = Donald Cram, Nobel Laureate and UCLA Chemist, Dies at 82 | publisher = [[University of California]] | date = 2001-06-19 | url = http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/3358 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080617125505/http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/article/3358 | archive-date = 2008-06-17 }}</ref> He showed a self-deprecating style, saying at one time:

<blockquote>An investigator starts research in a new field with faith, a foggy idea, and a few wild experiments. Eventually the interplay of negative and positive results guides the work. By the time the research is completed, he or she knows how it should have been started and conducted. [http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/d/donaldcram193831.html]</blockquote>

==Personal life==
Cram once admitted that his career wasn't without sacrifice. His first wife was Rollins classmate, Jean Turner, who also graduated in 1941, and went on to receive a master's degree in social work from [[Columbia University]]. His second wife, Jane, is a former chemistry professor at [[Mount Holyoke College]]. Cram chose not to have any children, "because I would either be a bad father or a bad scientist."<ref name=RollinsCramBio/>

Cram died of cancer in 2001, at the age of 82.<ref name = press_release/>
