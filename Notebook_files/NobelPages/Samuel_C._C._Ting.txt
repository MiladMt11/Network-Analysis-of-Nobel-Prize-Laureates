'''Samuel Chao Chung Ting''' ({{zh |c = 丁肇中 |p =Dīng Zhàozhōng}}, born January 27, 1936) is a Chinese-American [[physics|physicist]] who, with [[Burton Richter]], received the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1976 for discovering the [[Subatomic particle|subatomic]] [[J/ψ particle]]. More recently he has been the principal investigator in research conducted with the [[Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer]], a device installed on the [[International Space Station]] in 2011.

== Biography ==
[[File:Chinese civil war map 02.jpg|thumb|left|Ting moved from [[Chongqing]] in the [[Sichuan]] region to [[Nanjing]], [[Jiangsu]] during the [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]].]]
Samuel Ting was born to Chinese parents both from [[Shandong]] province on January 27, 1936, in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]].<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.5.031142/full/|doi=10.1063/PT.5.031142|title=Samuel Ting|journal=Physics Today|year=2016}}</ref> His parents, Kuan-hai Ting and [[Tsun-ying Wong]], met and married as graduate students at the [[University of Michigan]].<ref name="Ng1995">{{cite book |last = Ng |first = Franklin |title = The Asian American encyclopedia |url = https://archive.org/details/asianamericanenc05ngfr |url-access = registration |year = 1995 |publisher = Marshall Cavendish |isbn = 978-1-85435-684-0 |pages = [https://archive.org/details/asianamericanenc05ngfr/page/n27 1], 490 }}</ref>

Ting's parents returned to China two months after his birth.<ref name="Ng1995" /> Ting would live in China and travel from [[Chongqing]] to [[Nanjing]].<ref name="InfiniteMIT" /> Due to the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion]], his education was disrupted<!--------------- the following statement was not true and without support: and he was mostly [[homeschooling|home-schooled]] by his parents---------------->. Because of the [[Chinese Civil War]] and the [[Chinese Communist Party|communist takeover]] of the mainland that forced the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]] to flee to [[Taiwan]], Ting moved to the island in 1949. He would live in Taiwan from 1949 to 1956 and conducted most of his formal schooling there.<ref name="InfiniteMIT">{{Cite web|title=Samuel C.C.

In 1956, Ting, who barely spoke English,<ref name="InfiniteMIT" /> returned to the [[United States]] at the age of 20 and attended the [[University of Michigan]]. There, he studied engineering, [[mathematics]], and [[physics]]. In 1959, he was awarded a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.E.]] in mathematics and in physics, and in 1962, he earned a [[Doctoral degree|doctorate]] in physics. In 1963, he worked at the European Organization for Nuclear Research ([[CERN]]). From 1965, he taught at [[Columbia University]] and worked at the [[DESY|Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY)]] in [[Germany]]. Since 1969, Ting has been a professor at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT).

Ting was awarded the [[Ernest Orlando Lawrence Award]] (in 1976), [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] (in 1976), [[Eringen Medal]] (in 1977), DeGaspari Award in Science from the Government of Italy (in 1988), Gold Medal for Science from Brescia, Italy (in 1988), and the NASA Public Service Medal (in 2001).<ref name=":0" />

In 1976, Ting was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], which he shared with [[Burton Richter]] of the [[Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]], for the discovery of the [[J/psi meson|J/ψ meson]] nuclear particle. They were chosen for the award, in the words of the Nobel committee, "for their pioneering work in the discovery of a heavy elementary particle of a new kind."<ref>{{cite web

Ting gave his Nobel Prize acceptance speech in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]. Although there had been [[China|Chinese]] recipients before ([[Tsung-Dao Lee]] and [[Chen Ning Yang]]), none had previously delivered the acceptance speech in [[Chinese Language|Chinese]]. In his Nobel banquet speech, Ting emphasized the importance of experimental work:

: ''In reality, a theory in natural science cannot be without experimental foundations; physics, in particular, comes from experimental work. I hope that awarding the Nobel Prize to me will awaken the interest of students from the developing nations so that they will realize the importance of experimental work.''<ref>{{Cite web |url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1976/ting-speech.html |title = Samuel C.C.Ting - Banquet Speech |date = December 10, 1976 |access-date = June 1, 2014 |website = Nobelprize.org.

{{Main|Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer|l1=Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer}}
[[File:Samuel Chao Chung Ting.jpg|alt=|thumb|Ting after he delivered a lecture on the topic of Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) in Shandong University in October 2011]]
In 1995, not long after the cancellation of the [[Superconducting Super Collider]] project had severely reduced the possibilities for experimental high-energy physics on Earth, Ting proposed the [[Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer]], a space-borne [[cosmic ray|cosmic-ray]] detector. The proposal was accepted and he became the principal investigator and has been directing the development since then. A prototype, ''AMS-01'', was flown and tested on [[Space Shuttle]] mission [[STS-91]] in 1998. The main mission, ''AMS-02'', was then planned for launch by the Shuttle and mounting on the [[International Space Station]].<ref name="NASA-AMS-02">{{cite web

Dr. Ting was forced to (successfully) lobby the [[United States Congress]] and the public to secure an additional Shuttle flight dedicated to this project. Also during this time, Ting had to deal with numerous technical problems in fabricating and qualifying the large, extremely sensitive and delicate detector module for space.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7475708/ NASA Presents: AMS - The Fight for Flight]</ref> ''AMS-02'' was successfully launched on Shuttle mission [[STS-134]] on May 16, 2011 and was installed on the [[International Space Station]] on May 19, 2011.<ref name="Hsu">{{cite web

== Personal life ==
Ting lived in a turbulent age during his childhood and his family was a big influence on him. In his biographical for the Nobel Prize, he recalled:

: ''Since both my parents were working, I was brought up by my maternal grandmother. My maternal grandfather lost his life during the first Chinese Revolution. After that, at the age of thirty-three, my grandmother decided to go to school, became a teacher, and brought my mother up alone. When I was young I often heard stories from my mother and grandmother recalling the difficult lives they had during that turbulent period and the efforts they made to provide my mother with a good education. Both of them were daring, original, and determined people, and they have left an indelible impression on me.''

: ''When I was twenty years old I decided to return to the United States for a better education. My parents' friend, G.G. Brown, Dean of the School of Engineering, University of Michigan, told my parents I would be welcome to stay with him and his family. At that time I knew very little English and had no idea of the cost of living in the United States. In China, I had read that many American students go through college on their own resources. I informed my parents that I would do likewise. I arrived at the Detroit airport on 6 September 1956 with $100, which at the time seemed more than adequate. I was somewhat frightened, did not know anyone, and communication was difficult.''<ref name="Nobel_Bio">{{cite web |url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1976/ting-bio.html |title = Samuel C.C. Ting - Biographical |date = 1976 |access-date = June 3, 2014 |website = Nobel prizes and laureates |publisher = [[Nobel Foundation]]}}</ref>

In 1960, Ting married Kay Louise Kuhne, an architect, and together they had two daughters, Jeanne Ting Chowning and Amy Ting. In 1985 he married Dr. Susan Carol Marks, and they had one son, Christopher, born in 1986.<ref name="Nobel_Bio" />
