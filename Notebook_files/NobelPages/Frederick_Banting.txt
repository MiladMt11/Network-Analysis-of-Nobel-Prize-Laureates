=== Isolation of insulin ===
{{Main|Insulin#History of study}}

[[File:C. H. Best and F. G. Banting ca. 1924.png|thumb|left|[[Charles H. Best]] and Banting, c. 1924.]]
An article he read about the [[pancreas]] piqued Banting's interest in [[diabetes]]. Banting had to give a talk on the pancreas to one of his classes at the [[University of Western Ontario]] on November 1, 1920, and he was therefore reading reports that other scientists had written.<ref name="bliss1984"/>{{rp|51–52}} Research by [[Bernhard Naunyn|Naunyn]], [[Oskar Minkowski|Minkowski]], [[Eugene Lindsay Opie|Opie]], [[Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer|Sharpey-Schafer]], and others suggested that diabetes resulted from a lack of a protein [[hormone]] secreted by the [[islets of Langerhans]] in the pancreas. Schafer had named this putative hormone "insulin". The hormone was thought to control the metabolism of sugar; its lack led to an increase of sugar in the blood which was then excreted in urine. Attempts to extract insulin from ground-up pancreas cells were unsuccessful, likely because of the destruction of the insulin by the [[proteolysis]] [[enzyme]] of the pancreas. The challenge was to find a way to extract insulin from the pancreas prior to its destruction.<ref name = "Nobel"/>

[[Moses Barron]] published an article in 1920 which described experimental closure of the [[pancreatic duct]] by [[ligature (medicine)|ligature]]; this further influenced Banting's thinking. The procedure caused deterioration of the cells of the pancreas that secrete [[trypsin]] which breaks down insulin, but it left the islets of Langerhans intact. Banting realized that this procedure would destroy the trypsin-secreting cells but not the insulin. Once the trypsin-secreting cells had died, insulin could be extracted from the islets of Langerhans. Banting discussed this approach with [[John Macleod (physiologist)|J. J. R. Macleod]], Professor of Physiology at the University of Toronto. Macleod provided experimental facilities and the assistance of one of his students, [[Charles Herbert Best|Charles Best]]. Banting and Best, with the assistance of biochemist [[James Collip]], began the production of insulin by this means.<ref name = "Nobel"/>

As the experiments proceeded, the required quantities could no longer be obtained by performing surgery on living dogs. In November 1921, Banting hit upon the idea of obtaining insulin from the fetal pancreas. He removed the pancreases from fetal calves at a [[William Davies Company|William Davies slaughterhouse]] and found the extracts to be just as potent as those extracted from the dog pancreases. By December 1921, he had also succeeded in extracting insulin from the adult pancreas.<ref name="rosenfeld2002">{{cite journal |last1=Rosenfeld |first1=Louis |title=Insulin: Discovery and Controversy |journal=Clinical Chemistry |date=December 1, 2002 |volume=48 |issue=12 |pages=2270–2288 |doi=10.1093/clinchem/48.12.2270 |pmid=12446492 |url=http://clinchem.aaccjnls.org/content/48/12/2270 |language=en |issn=0009-9147|doi-access=free }}</ref> Pork and beef would remain the primary commercial sources of insulin until they were replaced by [[Insulin#Synthesis 2|genetically-engineered bacteria]] in the late 20th century. On 11 January, 1922 the first ever injection of insulin was given to 14-year-old Canadian [[Leonard_Thompson_(diabetic)|Leonard Thompson]] at [[Toronto General Hospital]]. In spring of 1922, Banting established a private practice in Toronto and began to treat diabetic patients. His first American patient was [[Elizabeth Hughes Gossett]], daughter of U.S. Secretary of State [[Charles Evans Hughes]].<ref name="bliss1982">{{cite book|last1=Bliss|first1=Michael|title=The Discovery of Insulin|date=1982|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226058979|url=https://archive.org/details/discoveryofinsul00blis}}</ref>

Banting and Macleod were jointly awarded the 1923 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. Banting split his half of the Prize money with Best, and Macleod split the other half of the Prize money with James Collip.<ref name="bliss1982"/>

Banting was appointed Senior Demonstrator in Medicine at the University of Toronto in 1922. The following year he was elected to the new Banting and Best Chair of Medical Research, endowed by the Legislature of the Province of Ontario. He also served as Honorary Consulting Physician to the Toronto General, the Hospital for Sick Children, and the Toronto Western Hospital. At the [[Banting and Best Department of Medical Research|Banting and Best Institute]], he focused his research on [[silicosis]], cancer, and the mechanisms of drowning.

In 1938, Banting's interest in aviation medicine resulted in his participation with the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] (RCAF) in research concerning the physiological problems encountered by pilots operating high-altitude combat aircraft. Banting headed the RCAF's Number 1 Clinical Investigation Unit (CIU), which was housed in a secret facility on the grounds of the former [[Toronto Hunt Club|Eglinton Hunt Club]] in Toronto.<ref>Canadian Space Agency.

During the Second World War he investigated the problems of aviators, such as "blackout" ([[Syncope (medicine)|syncope]]).<ref name = "Nobel"/> He also helped Wilbur Franks with the invention of the [[G-suit]] to stop pilots from blacking out when they were subjected to [[g-force]]s while turning or diving.<ref name="bliss1984"/>{{rp|255}} Another of Banting's projects during the Second World War involved using and treating mustard gas burns. Banting even tested the gas and antidotes on himself to see if they were effective.<ref name="bliss1984"/>{{rp|256}}

=== Statements on Hudson's Bay Company ===
[[File:Photograph of Jackson and Banting on the S. S. Boethic.jpg|thumb|[[A. Y. Jackson]] and Banting on the SS ''Beothic'', 1927]]
During his 1927 Arctic trip with [[A. Y. Jackson]], Banting realised that crew or passengers on board the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) paddle wheeler SS Distributor were responsible for spreading the influenza virus down the [[Slave River]] and [[Mackenzie River]], a virus that had over the summer and autumn spread territory-wide, devastating the aboriginal population of the north.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nwttimeline.ca/1925/1928JacksonBanting.htm|title=1925-1949, Historical Timeline of the Northwest Territories|last=Prince of Wales Northern Heritage Centre, Yellowknife|website=Historical Timeline of the Northwest Territories|access-date=March 13, 2019}}</ref> Returning from the trip, Banting gave an interview in Montreal with a ''[[Toronto Star]]'' reporter under the agreement that his statements on HBC would remain off the record.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Jackson|first=Alexander Young|date=May 15, 1965|title=Men and books: Memories of a fellow artist, Frederick Grant Banting|url=https://insulin.library.utoronto.ca/islandora/object/insulin%3AT10193|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|volume=92|pages=1077–1084|via=University of Toronto Libraries}}</ref> The conversation was nonetheless published in the ''Toronto Star'' and rapidly reached a wide audience across Europe and Australia.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last1=Tester|first1=Frank James|last2=McNicoll|first2=Paule|date=Nov 2008|title=A Voice of Presence: Inuit Contributions toward the Public Provision of Health Care in Canada, 1900-1930|journal=Social History/Histoire Sociale|volume=41|issue=82|pages=535–561|doi=10.1353/his.0.0034|s2cid=144773818}}</ref> Banting was angry at the leak, having promised the Department of the Interior not to make any statements to the press prior to clearing them.<ref name=":5" />

The article noted that Banting had given the journalist C. R. Greenaway repeated instances of how the fox fur trade always favoured the company: "For over $100,000 of fox skins, he estimated that the Eskimos had not received $5,000 worth of goods."<ref name=":5" /> He traced this treatment to health, consistent with reports made in previous years by RCMP officers, suggesting that "the result was a diet of "flour, biscuits, tea and tobacco," with the skins that once were used for clothing traded merely for "cheap whiteman's goods.""<ref name=":5" />

The fur trade commissioner for the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] called Banting's remarks "false and slanderous", and a month later, the governor and general manager of HBC met Banting at the [[The Omni King Edward Hotel|King Edward Hotel]] to demand a retraction.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":4" /> Banting stated that the reporter had betrayed his confidence, but did not retract his statement and reaffirmed that HBC was responsible for the death of indigenous residents by supplying the wrong kind of food and introducing diseases into the Arctic.<ref name=":4" /> As [[A. Y. Jackson]] notes in his memoir, since neither the governor nor the general manager had been to the Arctic, the meeting ended with them asking Banting's advice on what HBC ought to do: "He gave them some good advice and later he received a card at Christmas with the Governor's best wishes."<ref name=":4" />

Banting also maintained this position in his report to the Department of the Interior:<ref name=":5" /><blockquote>He noted that “infant mortality was high because of the undernourishment of the mother before birth”; that “white man’s food leads to decay of native teeth”; that “tuberculosis has commenced. Saw several cases at Godhavn, Etah, Port Burwell, Arctic Bay”; that “an epidemic resembling influenza killed a considerable proportion of population at Port Burwell”; and that “the gravest danger faces the Eskimo in his transfer from a race-long hunter to a dependent trapper. White flour, sea-biscuits, tea and tobacco do not provide sufficient fuel to warm and nourish him.” Furthermore, he discouraged the establishment of an Arctic hospital. The “proposed hospital at Pangnirtung would be a waste of money, as it could be reached by only a few natives.” Banting's report contrasted starkly with the bland descriptions provided by the ship's physician, F. H. Stringer.</blockquote>

==Personal life==
[[File:Frederick Banting and Marion Robertson.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Banting and Marion Robertson on their wedding day]]
Banting married twice. His first marriage was to Marion Robertson in 1924; they had one child, William (1929–1998). They divorced in 1932 and Banting married [[Henrietta Banting|Henrietta Ball]] in 1937.<ref name="Nobel" />

In February 1941, Banting died of wounds and exposure following the crash of a [[Lockheed L-14 Super Electra]]/[[Lockheed Hudson|Hudson]] in which he was a passenger, in [[Musgrave Harbour]], [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]].

=== Painting ===
Banting developed an interest in painting beginning around 1921 while he was in London, Ontario. Some of his first pieces were done on the back of the cardboard in which his shirts were packed by the dry-cleaners.<ref name="bliss1984" />{{rp|51}} He became friends with The [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]] artists [[A.

In 1927, he made a sketching trip with Jackson to the [[St. Lawrence River]] in [[Quebec]]. Later that year, they travelled to RCMP outposts in the Arctic on the Canadian Government supply ship Beothic. The sketches, done both in oils on birch panels and in pen and ink, were named after the places he visited: [[Craig Harbour, Nunavut|Craig Harbour]], Ellesmere Island; [[Pond Inlet]], Baylot Island; Eskimo tents at Etach; others were untitled. Jackson and Banting also made painting expeditions to [[Great Slave Lake]], Walsh Lake ([[Northwest Territories]]), [[Georgian Bay]], [[French River (Ontario)|French River]] and the [[Sudbury District]].<ref name="NGC">{{cite encyclopedia|last=MacDonald|first=Colin S.|url=http://www.pro.rcip-chin.gc.ca/bd-dl/aac-aic-eng.jsp?emu=en.aich:/Proxapp/ws/aich/user/wwwe/Record&upp=0&m=1&w=NATIVE%28%27ARTIST+ph+words+%27%27Frederick+Banting%27%27%27%29&order=native%28%27every+AR%27%29&bio=BANTINGSirFrederickGrant.html|title=Banting, F.

=== Properties ===

[[Banting House]], his former home located in London, Ontario, was declared a [[National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site of Canada]] in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |title=Banting House National Historic Site of Canada |url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/rech-srch/clic-click.aspx?/cgi-bin/MsmGo.exe?grab_id=0&page_id=28449&query=banting&hiword=BANTINGS%20banting%20 |website=Directory of Federal Heritage Designations |publisher=Parks Canada |date=March 15, 2012 |access-date=July 29, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904082025/http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/rech-srch/clic-click.aspx?%2Fcgi-bin%2FMsmGo.exe%3Fgrab_id=0&page_id=28449&query=banting&hiword=BANTINGS%20banting%20 |archive-date=September 4, 2015  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Banting House National Historic Site of Canada |url=http://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=4021&pid=0 |website=HistoricPlaces.ca |publisher=Parks Canada |date=November 23, 1997 |access-date=July 29, 2015}}</ref> The Banting Interpretation Centre in [[Musgrave Harbour, Newfoundland and Labrador]] is a museum named after him which focuses on the circumstances surrounding the 1941 plane crash which claimed his life. The crater [[Banting (crater)|Banting]] on the [[Moon]] is also named after him for his contributions to medicine.

During the voting for "[[The Greatest Canadian|Greatest Canadians]]" in late 2003, controversy rose over the future use of the Banting family farm in [[New Tecumseth]] which had been left to the Ontario Historical Society by Banting's late nephew, Edward, in 1998. The dispute centred on the future use of the 40 ha (100 acre) property and its buildings. In a year-long negotiation, assisted by a provincially appointed facilitator, the Town of New Tecumseth offered $1 million to the Ontario Historical Society (OHS). The town intended to turn the property over to the Sir Frederick Banting Legacy Foundation for preservation of the property and buildings, and the Legacy Foundation planned to erect a Camp for Diabetic Youths. The day after the November 22, 2006, deadline for the OHS to sign the agreement, the OHS announced that it had sold the property for housing development to Solmar Development for more than $2 million.<ref>{{cite journal |journal= Canadian Medical Association Journal|date=June 5, 2007 |type=PDF |title=Sir Frederick Banting homestead sold to developer, family outraged |volume=176 |issue=12 |pages=1691–92 |doi=10.1503/cmaj.070613 |pmid=17548378 |pmc=1877854|last1=Fletcher |first1=K}}</ref>

The Town of New Tecumseth announced it would designate the property under the Ontario Heritage Act. This would prevent its commercial development and obligate the owner to maintain it properly. OHS objected. The Ontario Conservation Review Board heard arguments for and against designation in September 2007 and recommended designation of the entire property in October. The Town officially passed the designation by-law on November 12, 2007.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Banting |first=Peter M., Dr. |date=November 23, 2007 |url=http://globalgenealogy.com/globalgazette/gazrr/gazrr125.htm |title=The Banting Homestead is now protected! |journal=The Global Gazette |publisher=GlobalGenealogy.com |access-date=December 31, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225174149/http://globalgenealogy.com/globalgazette/gazrr/gazrr125.htm |archive-date=December 25, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>
