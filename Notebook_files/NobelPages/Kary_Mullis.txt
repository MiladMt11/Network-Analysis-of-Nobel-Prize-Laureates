== Career ==
After receiving his doctorate, Mullis briefly left science to write fiction before accepting the University of Kansas fellowship.<ref name="esquire 1994" /> During his postdoctoral work, he managed a bakery for two years.<ref name="Wade">{{Cite news |last=Wade |first=Nicholas |title=Scientist at Work/Kary Mullis; After the 'Eureka', a Nobelist Drops Out |date=September 15, 1998 |work=[[The New York Times]] |page=F1 |issn=0362-4331 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E7DD1331F936A2575AC0A96E958260 |url-access=limited}}</ref> Mullis returned to science at the encouragement of Berkeley friend and colleague Thomas White, who secured Mullis' UCSF position and later helped Mullis land a position with the biotechnology company [[Cetus Corporation]] of [[Emeryville, California]].<ref name="biotechnology101" /><ref name="Wade" /> Despite little experience in [[molecular biology]], Mullis worked as a [[DNA]] [[chemist]] at Cetus for seven years, ultimately serving as head of the DNA synthesis lab under White, then the firm's director of molecular and biological research; it was there, in 1983, that Mullis invented the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) procedure.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/science/tq/displayStory.cfm?Story_id=2477036 |title= The Economist |date= March 13, 2004|access-date=July 27, 2010}}</ref>

Mullis acquired a reputation for erratic behavior at Cetus, once threatening to bring a [[gun]] to work; he also engaged in "public lovers' quarrels" with his then-girlfriend (a fellow chemist at the company) and "nearly came to blows with another scientist" at a staff party.{{r|McDonald}} According to White, "It definitely put me in a tough spot. His behavior was so outrageous that the other scientists thought that the only reason I didn't fire him outright was that he was a friend of mine."<ref name="McDonald"/>

After resigning from Cetus in 1986, Mullis served as director of molecular biology for Xytronyx, Inc. in [[San Diego]] for two years. While inventing a UV-sensitive ink at Xytronyx, he became skeptical of the existence of the ozone hole.

Thereafter, Mullis worked intermittently as a consultant for multiple corporations and institutions on nucleic acid chemistry and as an [[expert witness]] specializing in [[DNA profiling]].<ref name=":2" /><ref name="Wade" /> While writing a National Institutes of Health grant progress report on the development of a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test for Specialty Labs, he became skeptical that HIV was the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).<ref name="Naked2">{{Cite book|last=Mullis|first=K|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCAqomvRYNMC&pg=PA115|title=Dancing Naked in the Mind Field|publisher=Vintage Books|year=1998|isbn=978-0-679-44255-4|pages=115–18, 143–53}}</ref> In 1992, Mullis founded a business to sell pieces of jewelry containing the amplified DNA of deceased famous people such as [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]].<ref name="lifeonedge" /><ref>{{Cite journal |url= https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=HL2GySNR8dj13v4D64WDGhlzhN8Fkspv6nJF6JwngX1NzhyfwZlK!930663388?docId=5002303854 |title= The Hastings Center Report |pages= 30 |year= 1998 |publisher=  |access-date=  |last1= Andrews |first1= Lori |last2= Nelkin |first2= Dorothy |journal=  |archive-date= January 17, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110117034323/http://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=HL2GySNR8dj13v4D64WDGhlzhN8Fkspv6nJF6JwngX1NzhyfwZlK!930663388?docId=5002303854 |url-status= dead }}</ref> That year, he also founded Atomic Tags in [[La Jolla, California]].

=== PCR and other inventions ===
{{Main|Taq Polymerase|History of polymerase chain reaction}}
In 1983, Mullis was working for Cetus Corporation as a chemist.<ref name="esquire 1994" /> As Mullis told it, while driving in the vicinity of his country home in [[Mendocino County]] with his girlfriend, who also was a chemist at Cetus, he had the idea to use a pair of primers to bracket the desired DNA sequence and to copy it using DNA polymerase; a technique that would allow rapid amplification of a small stretch of DNA and become a standard procedure in molecular biology laboratories.<ref name="esquire 1994" /> Longtime professional benefactor and supervisor Thomas White reassigned Mullis from his usual projects to concentrate on PCR full-time after the technique was met with skepticism by their colleagues.<ref name="esquire 1994" /><ref name="McDonald"/> Mullis succeeded in demonstrating PCR on December 16, 1985, but the staff remained circumspect as he continued to produce ambiguous results amid alleged methodological problems, including a perceived lack of "appropriate controls and repetition."<ref name="esquire 1994" /><ref name="McDonald"/> In his Nobel Prize lecture, he remarked that the December 16 breakthrough did not make up for his girlfriend breaking up with him: "I was sagging as I walked out to my little silver [[Honda Civic]]. Neither [assistant] Fred, empty [[Beck's Brewery|Beck's]] bottles, nor the sweet smell of the dawn of the age of PCR could replace Jenny. I was lonesome."<ref name="esquire 1994" />

Other Cetus scientists who were regarded as "top-notch experimentalists",<ref name="McDonald"/> including Randall Saiki, Henry Erlich, and [[Norman Arnheim]], were placed on parallel PCR projects to work on determining if PCR could amplify a specific human gene (betaglobin) from genomic DNA. Saiki generated the needed data and Erlich authored the first paper to include utilization of the technique,<ref name="Wade" /> while Mullis was still working on the paper that would describe PCR itself.<ref name="esquire 1994" /> Mullis' 1985 paper with Saiki and Erlich, "Enzymatic Amplification of β-globin Genomic Sequences and Restriction Site Analysis for Diagnosis of Sickle Cell Anemia" — the polymerase chain reaction invention (PCR) — was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society in 2017.<ref name="breakthrough">{{Cite web|title=Citations for Chemical Breakthrough Awards 2017 Awardees|url=http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/HIST/awards/CCB-2017_Awardees.php|website=Division of the History of Chemistry|access-date=12 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Saiki|first1=R.|last2=Scharf|first2=S|last3=Faloona|first3=F|last4=Mullis|first4=K.|last5=Horn|first5=G.|last6=Erlich|first6=H.|last7=Arnheim|first7=N|title=Enzymatic amplification of beta-globin genomic sequences and restriction site analysis for diagnosis of sickle cell anemia|journal=Science|date=20 December 1985|volume=230|issue=4732|pages=1350–1354|doi=10.1126/science.2999980|pmid=2999980|bibcode=1985Sci...230.1350S}}</ref>

A drawback of the technique was that the DNA polymerase in the reaction was destroyed by the high heat used at the start of each replication cycle and had to be replaced. In 1986, Saiki started to use ''[[Thermophilus aquaticus]]'' (Taq) [[DNA polymerase]] to amplify segments of DNA. The Taq polymerase was heat resistant and only needed to be added to the reaction once, making the technique dramatically more affordable and subject to automation. This modification of Mullis' invention revolutionized  biochemistry, molecular biology, [[genetics]], medicine, and [[forensics]]. According to University of California, Berkeley biologist David Bilder, "PCR revolutionized everything. It really superpowered molecular biology—which then transformed other fields, even distant ones like [[ecology]] and [[evolution]]. … It’s impossible to overstate PCR’s impact. The ability to generate as much DNA of a specific sequence as you want, starting from a few simple chemicals and some temperature changes—it’s just magical."<ref name="McDonald"/> Although he received a $10,000 bonus from Cetus for the invention, the company's later sale of the patent to [[Roche Molecular Systems]] for $300 million would lead Mullis to condemn White and members of the parallel team as "vultures."<ref name="esquire 1994" /><ref name="McDonald"/>

Mullis also invented a UV-sensitive plastic that changes color in response to light.

He founded Altermune LLC in 2011 to pursue new ideas on the immune system.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20140914135558/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/22/idUS134319+22-Sep-2011+BW20110922 Loxbridge and Dr Kary Mullis Announce the Formation of Altermune Technologies with $7m Seed Investment.] [https://web.archive.org/web/20140914135558/http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/09/22/idUS134319+22-Sep-2011+BW20110922 Archived]</ref> Mullis described the company's novel technology in a presentation:
{{Quote |style=font-size:100% |It is a method using specific synthetic chemical linkers to divert an immune response from its nominal target to something completely different which you would right now like to be temporarily immune to. Let's say you just got exposed to a new strain of the flu. You're already immune to alpha-1,3-galactosyl-galactose bonds. All humans are. Why not divert a fraction of those antibodies to the influenza strain you just picked up? A chemical linker synthesized with an alpha-1,3-gal-gal bond on one end and a DNA aptamer devised to bind specifically to the strain of influenza you have on the other end will link anti-alpha-Gal antibodies to the influenza virus and presto!--you have fooled your immune system into attacking the new virus.<ref name="nobelbio" /><ref name="tedKillerInfection">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/lang/eng/kary_mullis_next_gen_cure_for_killer_infections.html |title=Kary Mullis' next-gen cure for killer infections &#124; Video on |publisher=Ted.com |date=February 2009 |access-date=July 27, 2010}}</ref>}}

In a TED Talk, Mullis describes how the US Government paid $500,000 for Mullis to use this new technology against Anthrax, which worked. The treatment was 100% effective, compared to the previous Anthrax treatment which was 40% effective.<ref name="tedKillerInfection" />

Another proof-of-principle of this technology, re-targeting pre-existing antibodies to the surface of a pathogenic strep bacteria using an alpha-gal modified aptamer ("alphamer"), was published in 2015 in collaboration with scientists at the University of California, San Diego.<ref>{{Cite press release |first=Heather |last=Buschman |title=Molecular Homing Beacon Redirects Human Antibodies to Fight Pathogenic Bacteria |url=http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/molecular_homing_beacon_redirects_human_antibodies_to_fight_pathogenic_bact |publisher=[[University of California, San Diego]] |date=May 6, 2015 |access-date=July 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |pmid=25940316 |title=Retargeting pre-existing human antibodies to a bacterial pathogen with an alpha-Gal conjugated aptamer |doi=10.1007/s00109-015-1280-4 |pmc=4469262 |volume=93 |issue=6 |year=2015 |journal=J.

=== Accreditation of the PCR technique ===
A concept similar to that of PCR had been described before Mullis' work. Nobel laureate [[H. Gobind Khorana]] and [[Kjell Kleppe]], a Norwegian scientist, authored a paper 17 years earlier describing a process they termed "repair replication" in the ''[[Journal of Molecular Biology]]''.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last1=Kleppe|first1=K.|last2=Ohtsuka|first2=E.|last3=Kleppe|first3=R.|last4=Molineux|first4=I.|last5=Khorana|first5=H.

The method developed by Mullis used repeated thermal cycling, which allowed the rapid and exponential amplification of large quantities of any desired DNA sequence from an extremely complex template. Later a heat-stable DNA polymerase was incorporated into the process.

His co-workers at Cetus, who were embittered by his abrupt departure from the company,<ref name="esquire 1994" />
contested that Mullis was solely responsible for the idea of using [[Taq polymerase]] in PCR. However, other scientists have written that the "full potential [of PCR] was not realized" until Mullis' work in 1983,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dexRnDtLlWUC&q=%22kary+mullis%22+%2B+%22kjell+kleppe%22&pg=PA20 |title=''Artificial DNA: Methods and Applications'' by Yury E.

After [[DuPont (1802–2017)|DuPont]] lost out to Roche on that sale, the company unsuccessfully disputed Mullis' patent on the alleged grounds that PCR had been previously described in 1971.<ref name="esquire 1994" /> Mullis and Erlich took Cetus' side in the case, and Khorana refused to testify for DuPont; the jury upheld Mullis' patent in 1991.<ref name="esquire 1994" /> However, in February 1999, the patent of Hoffman-La Roche (United States Patent No. 4,889,818) was found by the courts to be unenforceable, after Dr. Thomas Kunkel testified in the case ''Hoffman-La Roche v.

The [[anthropology|anthropologist]] [[Paul Rabinow]] wrote a book on the history of the PCR method in 1996 (titled ''Making PCR'') in which he discussed whether Mullis "invented" PCR or "merely" came up with the concept of it. Rabinow, a [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] scholar interested in issues of the production of knowledge, used the topic to argue against the idea that scientific discovery is the product of individual work, writing, "Committees and science journalists like the idea of associating a unique idea with a unique person, the lone genius. PCR is thought by some to be an example of teamwork, but by others as the genius of one who was smart enough to put things together which were present to all, but overlooked. For Mullis, the light bulb went off, but for others it did not. This is consistent with the idea, that the prepared (educated) mind who is careful to observe and not overlook, is what separates the genius scientist from his many also smart scientists. The proof is in the fact that the person who has the light bulb go off never forgets the "Ah!" experience, while the others never had this photochemical reaction go off in their brains."<ref>{{Cite web|author=Richard Bilsker |url=http://www.hyle.org/journal/issues/4/bilsker.htm |title=Ethnography of a Nobel Prize |publisher=Hyle.org |access-date=July 27, 2010}}</ref>

== Views on HIV/AIDS and climate change ==
Mullis was quoted saying "the never-ending quest for more grants and staying with established dogmas" has hurt science.<ref name="esquire 1994" /> He believed that "science is being practiced by people who are dependent on being paid for what they are ''going'' to find out," not for what they actually produce.<ref name="esquire 1994" />

== Use of hallucinogens ==
Mullis practiced [[clandestine chemistry]] throughout his graduate studies, specializing in the synthesis of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]]; according to White, "I knew he was a good chemist because he'd been synthesizing hallucinogenic drugs at Berkeley."<ref name="McDonald"/> He detailed his experiences synthesizing and testing various psychedelic amphetamines and a difficult trip on [[Diethyltryptamine|DET]] in his autobiography.<ref name="Naked2"/> In a Q&A interview published in the September 1994 issue of ''[[California Monthly]]'', Mullis said, "Back in the 1960s and early 1970s I took plenty of LSD.

It was certainly much more important than any courses I ever took."<ref name="Schoch">{{Cite magazine |last=Schoch |first=Russell |title=Q&A – A Conversation with Kerry Mullis |magazine=California Monthly |volume=105 |issue=1 |page=20 |publisher=California Alumni Association |location=Berkeley, California |date=September 1994 |oclc=939087276}}</ref>{{vn|date=December 2019}} During a symposium held for centenarian [[Albert Hofmann]], Hofmann said Mullis had told him that LSD had "helped him develop the polymerase chain reaction that helps amplify specific DNA sequences".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2006/01/70015 |title=LSD: The Geek's Wonder Drug? |access-date=March 11, 2008 |author=Harrison, Ann |date=January 16, 2006 |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |publisher=Wired |quote=Like Herbert, many scientists and engineers also report heightened states of creativity while using LSD.
