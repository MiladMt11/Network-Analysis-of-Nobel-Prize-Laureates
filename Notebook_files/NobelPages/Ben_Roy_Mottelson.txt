'''Ben Roy Mottelson''' (born July 9, 1926) is an American-Danish [[nuclear physics|nuclear physicist]]. He won the 1975 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for his work on the non-spherical geometry of [[Atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]].

==Early life==
Mottelson was born in [[Chicago, Illinois]] in July 1926, the son of Georgia (Blum) and Goodman Mottelson, an engineer. He graduated from [[Lyons Township High School]] in [[LaGrange, Illinois]]. He received a [[Bachelor's degree]] from [[Purdue University]] in 1947, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in nuclear physics from [[Harvard University]] in 1950.

==Career==
He moved to Institute for Theoretical Physics (later the [[Niels Bohr Institute]]) in [[Copenhagen]] on the Sheldon Traveling Fellowship from Harvard, and remained in Denmark. In 1953 he was appointed staff member in [[CERN]]'s Theoretical Study Group, which was based in Copenhagen,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/User:Ben_Mottelson | publisher=Scholarpedia | access-date=11 June 2015|title = Prof. Ben Mottelson}}</ref> a position he held until he became professor at the newly formed [[Nordic Institute for Theoretical Physics]] (Nordita) in 1957. He was a visiting professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in Spring 1959.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ben R. Mottelson - Biographical|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1975/mottelson-bio.html|publisher=Nobel Foundation|access-date=1 June 2017}}</ref> In 1971 he became a naturalized [[Danish citizen]].

In 1950–51, [[James Rainwater]] and [[Aage Bohr]] had developed models of the [[atomic nucleus]] which began to take into account the behaviour of the individual [[nucleon]]s.  These models, which moved beyond the simpler [[Semi-empirical mass formula#The liquid drop model and its analysis|liquid drop]] treatment of the nucleus as having effectively no internal structure, were the first models which could explain a number of nuclear properties, including the non-spherical distribution of charge in certain nuclei.  Mottelson worked with Aage Bohr to compare the theoretical models with experimental data. In three papers which were published in 1952–53, Bohr and Mottelson demonstrated close agreement between theory and experiment, for example showing that the energy levels of certain nuclei could be described by a rotation spectrum.  This work stimulated new theoretical and experimental studies.

===Nobel Prize (1975)===
Rainwater, Bohr and Mottelson were jointly awarded the 1975 Nobel Prize in Physics "for the discovery of the connection between collective motion and particle motion in atomic nuclei and the development of the theory of the [[structure of the atomic nucleus]] based on this connection".<ref name="Nobelpressrelease">[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1975/ Nobel prize citation]. Nobelprize.org. Retrieved on 2012-02-18.</ref>

===Post-Nobel prize work===
Bohr and Mottelson continued to work together, publishing a two-volume [[monograph]], ''Nuclear Structure''. The first volume, ''Single-Particle Motion,'' appeared in 1969, and the second volume, ''Nuclear Deformations,'' in 1975.

Professor Mottelson is a member of the Board of Sponsors of the ''[[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]]''.<ref>[http://www.thebulletin.org/content/about-us/board-of-sponsors Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists – Board of Sponsors] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420084037/http://www.thebulletin.org/content/about-us/board-of-sponsors |date=2009-04-20 }}.

He is an honorary member of the [[Finnish Society of Sciences and Letters]], a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=APS Member History|url=https://search.amphilsoc.org/memhist/search?creator=Ben+R.+Mottelson&title=&subject=&subdiv=&mem=&year=&year-max=&dead=&keyword=&smode=advanced|access-date=2021-03-31|website=search.amphilsoc.org}}</ref> and a foreign fellow of [[Bangladesh Academy of Sciences]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bas.org.bd/list-of-fellows/userslist.html |title=List of Fellows of Bangladesh Academy of Sciences |access-date=2016-08-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415000333/http://www.bas.org.bd/list-of-fellows/userslist.html |archive-date=2010-04-15 }}</ref> and the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dnva.no/c26849/artikkel/vis.html?tid=40118|title=Gruppe 2: Fysikkfag (herunder astronomi, fysikk og geofysikk)|publisher=[[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]]|language=no|access-date=7 October 2010}}</ref> In 1969, he received the [[Atoms for Peace Award]]. He acted as director of ECT* (Trento, Italy) from 1993 to 1997.

==Personal life==
Mottelson is a [[Dual citizenship|dual citizen]], as he holds both [[Danish nationality law|Danish]] and [[Citizenship of the United States|American]] passports. He lives in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. Mottelson was married to Nancy Jane Reno from 1948 until her death in 1975, and they had two sons and one daughter. Mottelson then married Britta Marger Siegumfeldt in 1983.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X6w-AQAAIAAJ&q=Britta+Marger+Siegumfeldt |title = MTI ki kicsoda|year = 2009}}</ref>
