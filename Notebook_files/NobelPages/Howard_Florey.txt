'''Howard Walter Florey, Baron Florey''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS-cats|OM|FRS|FRCP}} (24 September 1898{{spaced ndash}}21 February 1968) was an Australian [[pharmacology|pharmacologist]] and [[pathology|pathologist]] who shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1945 with [[Ernst Chain|Sir Ernst Chain]] and [[Alexander Fleming|Sir Alexander Fleming]] for his role in the development of [[penicillin]].

Although Fleming received most of the credit for the discovery of penicillin, it was Florey who carried out the first clinical trials of penicillin in 1941 at the [[Radcliffe Infirmary]] in [[Oxford]] on the first patient, a [[police constable]] from Oxford. The patient started to recover, but subsequently died because Florey was unable, at that time, to make enough penicillin. It was Florey and Chain who actually made a useful and effective drug out of penicillin, after the task had been abandoned as too difficult.

Florey's discoveries, along with the discoveries of Fleming and Ernst Chain, are estimated to have saved over 200 million lives,<ref>Woodward, Billy. "Howard Florey-Over 6&nbsp;million Lives Saved." ''Scientists Greater Than Einstein'' Fresno: Quill Driver Books, 2009 {{ISBN|1-884956-87-4}}.</ref> and he is consequently regarded by the Australian scientific and medical community as one of its greatest figures. [[Sir Robert Menzies]], Australia's longest-serving [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]], said, "In terms of world well-being, Florey was the most important man ever born in Australia."<ref name="ADB">{{cite book | author=Fenner, Frank | chapter=Florey, Howard Walter (Baron Florey) (1898–1968) | chapter-url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A140202b.htm | title=Australian Dictionary of Biography | volume=14 | pages=188–190 | year=1996 |access-date=10 October 2008 | publisher=Melbourne University Press}}</ref>

== Early life and education ==
Howard Florey was born in [[Malvern, South Australia|Malvern]], a southern suburb of [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]], the youngest of three children and the only son.<ref name="ADB" /> His father, Joseph Florey, was an English immigrant, and his mother Bertha Mary Wadham was a second-generation Australian.<ref>{{cite book |doi=10.1038/npg.els.0002792 |chapter=Florey, Howard Walter |title=Encyclopedia of Life Sciences |year=2001 |last1=Quirke |first1=Viviane M. |isbn=9780470016176}} {{Closed access}}</ref><ref name="frs" />{{rp|255}} His sister [[Hilda Gardner]] became a bacteriologist and a pioneer of laboratory medicine.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Melbourne|first=National Foundation for Australian Women and The University of|title=Gardner, Joan Forrest - Woman - The Australian Women's Register|url=https://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/AWE6064b.htm|access-date=2021-10-12|website=www.womenaustralia.info|language=en-gb}}</ref>

Florey was educated at [[Kyre College]] Preparatory School (now [[Scotch College, Adelaide|Scotch College]]) and then [[St Peter's College, Adelaide]],<ref name="frs" /> where he excelled in chemistry and physics, but not mathematics.<ref name="Lax">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NFgXCAAAQBAJ&pg=PT43 |title=The Mold in Dr. Florey's Coat: The Story of the Penicillin Miracle |last=Lax |first=Eric |date=2 June 2015 |publisher=Henry Holt and Company |isbn=9781627796446 |pages=43–45 }}</ref> He also played various sports for the school: cricket, football, athletics, and tennis.<ref name="frs" />{{rp|255}} He studied medicine at the [[University of Adelaide]] from 1917 to 1921, paid entirely by a state scholarship he had achieved.<ref name="Lax" />

Florey continued his studies at [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], as a [[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholar]] under the tutelage of Sir [[Charles Scott Sherrington]], receiving the degrees of [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1924 and [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|MA]] in 1935.<ref name="ADB" /> In 1925, he left Oxford to attend the [[University of Cambridge]], during which time he won a fellowship from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and studied in the United States for ten months. He returned to England in 1926 and was elected to a fellowship at [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge]], and a year later he received the degree of PhD.<ref name="frs" />{{rp|258–259}}

== Career ==
After Cambridge, Florey was appointed to the Joseph Hunter Chair of [[Pathology]] at the [[University of Sheffield]] in 1932. In 1935 he returned to Oxford, as Professor of Pathology and Fellow of [[Lincoln College, Oxford]], leading a team of researchers. Working with [[Ernst Boris Chain]], [[Norman Heatley]] and [[Edward Abraham]], he read [[Alexander Fleming]]'s paper discussing the antibacterial effects of ''[[Penicillium chrysogenum|Penicillium notatum]]'' mould.<ref name="frs" />{{rp|260–262}}

In 1941, he and Chain treated their first patient, [[Albert Alexander (police officer)|Albert Alexander]], who had had a small sore at the corner of his mouth, which then spread, leading to a severe facial infection involving [[Streptococcus|streptococci]] and [[Staphylococcus|staphylococci]]. His whole face, eyes and scalp were swollen to the extent that he had had an eye removed to relieve the pain. Within a day of being given penicillin, he started to recover. However, the researchers did not have enough penicillin to help him to a full recovery, and he relapsed and died. Because of this experience and the difficulty in producing penicillin, the researchers changed their focus to children, who could be treated with smaller quantities of penicillin.<ref>{{cite book |last1=MacFarlane |first1=Gwyn |title=Howard Florey : the making of a great scientist |date=1979 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780198581611 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/howardfloreymaki00macf/page/327 327–346] |chapter=The proving of penicillin |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/howardfloreymaki00macf/page/327 }}</ref>

Florey's research team investigated the large-scale production of the mould and efficient extraction of the active ingredient, succeeding to the point where, by 1945, penicillin production was an industrial process for the Allies in World War II. However, Florey said that the project was originally driven by scientific interests, and that the medicinal discovery was a bonus:<ref name=bio>{{cite web |url=http://www.asap.unimelb.edu.au/bsparcs/exhib/journal/as_florey.htm |work=Australasian Science |publisher=[[University of Melbourne]] |title=Howard Florey |first=Denise |last=Sutherland |date=28 January 1998 |access-date=21 February 2019 }}</ref>

{{quote|People sometimes think that I and the others worked on penicillin because we were interested in suffering humanity. I don't think it ever crossed our minds about suffering humanity.

Florey shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1945 with Ernst Boris Chain and Alexander Fleming. Fleming first observed the antibiotic properties of the mould that makes penicillin, but it was Chain and Florey who developed it into a useful treatment.<ref name="Judson">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/20/opinion/no-nobel-prize-for-whining.html?sec=health |title=No Nobel Prize for Whining |last=Judson |first=Horace Freeland |date=20 October 2003 |work=The New York Times |access-date=23 June 2010}}</ref>

In 1958 Florey opened the [[John Curtin School of Medical Research]] at ANU in Canberra. In 1965 the Queen made him Lord Florey and he was offered, and accepted, the role of Chancellor of the [[Australian National University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.anu.edu.au/about/our-history/lord-howard-florey-om-frs-frcp |title=Lord Howard Florey OM FRS FRCP |work=About: Our history |publisher=[[Australian National University]] |date=n.d. |access-date=12 April 2018 }}</ref>

[[File:The Florey Building - geograph.org.uk - 1309650.jpg|thumb|Florey Building]]
Florey was elected a member of the [[Royal Society]] in 1941 and became president in 1958.<ref name="frs"/> In 1962, Florey became Provost of [[The Queen's College, Oxford]]. During his term as Provost, the college built a new residential block, named the Florey Building in his honour. The building was designed by the British architect Sir [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]].

On 4 February 1965, Sir Howard was created a [[life peer]] and became '''Baron Florey''', of Adelaide in the State of South Australia and Commonwealth of Australia and of Marston in the City of Oxford.<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=43571 |date=9 February 1965 |page=1373}}</ref> This was a higher honour than the knighthood awarded to penicillin's discoverer, Sir Alexander Fleming, and it recognised the monumental work Florey had done in making penicillin available in sufficient quantities to save millions of lives in the war, despite Fleming's doubts that this was feasible. On 15 July 1965 Florey was appointed a [[Order of Merit|Member of The Order of Merit]].<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=43713 |date=16 July 1965 |page=6729}}</ref>

Florey was Chancellor of the [[Australian National University]] from 1965 until his death in 1968. The lecture theatre at the John Curtin School of Medical Research was named for him during his tenure at the ANU.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Building Highlight - John Curtin School of Medical Research - Archives - ANU|url=https://archives.anu.edu.au/exhibitions/building-australias-national-university-75-years-australian-national-university-50|access-date=2021-08-19|website=archives.anu.edu.au|language=en}}</ref>
