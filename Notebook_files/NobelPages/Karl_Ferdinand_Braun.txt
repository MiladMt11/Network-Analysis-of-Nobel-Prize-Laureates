'''Karl Ferdinand Braun''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfɛʁdinant ˈbʁaʊ̯n|-|De-Ferdinand Braun.ogg}}; 6 June 1850 – 20 April 1918) was a German [[electrical engineer]], inventor, [[physicist]] and [[Nobel Prize in Physics|Nobel laureate in physics]]. Braun contributed significantly to the development of radio and television technology: he shared the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physics with [[Guglielmo Marconi]] "for their contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy".

==Biography==
Braun was born in [[Fulda]], Germany, and educated at the [[University of Marburg]] and received a PhD from the [[University of Berlin]] in 1872. In 1874, he discovered that a point-contact [[semiconductor]] [[rectifier|rectifies]] [[alternating current]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Braun |first=F. |author-link=Ferdinand Braun |year=1874 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YBJbAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA556 |title=Ueber die Stromleitung durch Schwefelmetalle |trans-title=On current conduction through metal sulfides |language=de |journal=Annalen der Physik und Chemie |volume=153 |issue=4 |pages=556–563 |doi=10.1002/andp.18752291207|bibcode = 1875AnP...229..556B }}</ref> He became director of the Physical Institute and professor of [[physics]] at the [[University of Strassburg]] in 1895.

In 1897, he built the first [[cathode-ray tube]] (CRT) and cathode ray tube [[oscilloscope]].<ref>Ferdinand Braun (1897) [https://archive.today/20141217172841/http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=wu.89048352892;view=1up;seq=568 "Ueber ein Verfahren zur Demonstration und zum Studium des zeitlichen Verlaufs variabler Ströme"] (On a process for the display and study of the course in time of variable currents), ''Annalen der Physik und Chemie'', 3rd series, '''60''' :  552–559.</ref> The CRT became the cornerstone in developing fully electronic television. It is still sometimes called the "Braun tube" in German-speaking countries (''Braunsche Röhre'') and other countries such as Korea (브라운관: ''Buraun-kwan'') and Japan (ブラウン管: ''Buraun-kan'').

During the [[History of radio|development of radio]], he also worked on [[wireless telegraphy]]. In 1897, Braun joined the line of wireless pioneers.<ref>In Germany he was called the "wireless wizard" and was credited there with having done more than any one else to perfect control of the new system of communication.</ref><ref>Patent DRP 111788. 1989.</ref> His major contributions were the introduction of a closed tuned circuit in the generating part of the transmitter, its separation from the radiating part (the antenna) by means of inductive coupling, and later on the usage of crystals for receiving purposes. Around 1898, he invented a [[crystal detector]] {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}. Wireless telegraphy claimed Dr. Braun's full attention in 1898, and for many years after that he applied himself almost exclusively to the task of solving its problems. Dr. Braun had written extensively on wireless subjects and was well known through his many contributions to the Electrician and other scientific journals.<ref name=Wireless>The Wireless Age, Volume 5. [https://books.google.com/books?id=DEfOAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA709 Page 709 – 713].</ref> In 1899, he would apply for the patent ''Wireless electro transmission of signals over surfaces''.<ref>The Electrical engineer, Volume 23. [https://books.google.com/books?id=9LPmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA159 Page 159]</ref> Also in 1899, he is said to have applied for a patent on ''Electro telegraphy by means of condensers and induction coils'' {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}.

Pioneers working on wireless devices eventually came to a limit of distance they could cover. Connecting the antenna directly to the spark gap produced only a heavily damped pulse train. There were only a few cycles before oscillations ceased. Braun's circuit afforded a much longer sustained oscillation because the energy encountered less losses swinging between coil and Leyden Jars. And by means of inductive antenna coupling the radiator was better matched to the generator. The resultant stronger and less bandwidth consuming signals bridged a much longer distance.

Braun invented the [[phased array]] antenna in 1905. He described in his Nobel Prize lecture how he carefully arranged three antennas to transmit a directional signal.<ref>[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1909/braun-lecture.html "Karl Ferdinand Braun – Nobel Lecture: Electrical Oscillations and Wireless Telegraphy"] p. 239. Nobelprize.org. Nobel Media AB 2013. Web. 28 September 2013.</ref> This invention led to the development of [[radar]], [[smart antennas]], and [[MIMO]].

Braun's British patent on tuning was used by Marconi in many of his tuning patents. [[Guglielmo Marconi]] used Braun's patents (among others).  Marconi would later admit to Braun himself that he had "''borrowed''" portions of Braun's work  {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}. In 1909, Braun shared the Nobel Prize for physics with Marconi for "contributions to the development of [[wireless telegraphy]]." The prize awarded to Braun in 1909 depicts this design. Braun experimented at first at the University of Strasbourg. Not before long he bridged a distance of 42&nbsp;km to the city of Mutzig. In spring 1899, Braun, accompanied by his colleagues Cantor and Zenneck, went to Cuxhaven to continue their experiments at the North Sea. On 24 September 1900 radio telegraphy signals were exchanged regularly with the island of [[Heligoland]] over a distance of 62&nbsp;km. Light vessels in the river Elbe and a coast station at [[Cuxhaven]] commenced a regular radio telegraph service.

Braun went to the United States at the beginning of [[World War I]] (before the U.S. had entered the war) to be a witness for the defense in a lawsuit regarding a 
patent claim by the [[Marconi Company|Marconi Corporation]] against the wireless station at [[Sayville, New York]]. After the US entered the war, Braun was [[detention (imprisonment)|detained]], but could move freely within [[Brooklyn]], New York. Braun died in his house in Brooklyn, before the war ended in 1918.<ref>https://www.emeriti-of-excellence.tum.de/fileadmin/w00bpl/www/Veranstaltungsarchiv/Vortraege_Highlights-der-Forschung/2012-05-08_Russer_Nanoelektronik_Quelle2.pdf</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ferdinand-Braun|title = Ferdinand Braun &#124; German physicist}}</ref>
