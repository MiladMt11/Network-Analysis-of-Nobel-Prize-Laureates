'''Edward Calvin Kendall''' (March 8, 1886 – May 4, 1972) was an [[United States|American]] [[chemist]].  In 1950, Kendall was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine]] along with Swiss chemist [[Tadeusz Reichstein]] and [[Mayo Clinic]] physician [[Philip Showalter Hench|Philip S. Hench]], for their work with the hormones of the adrenal gland.  Kendall did not only focus on the adrenal glands, he was also responsible for the isolation of [[thyroxine]], a hormone of the [[thyroid gland]] and worked with the team that crystallized [[glutathione]] and identified its chemical structure.

Kendall was a biochemist at the Graduate School of the [[Mayo Foundation]] at the time of the award.  He received his education at [[Columbia University]].  After retiring from his job with the Mayo Foundation, Kendall joined the faculty at [[Princeton University]], where he remained until his death in 1972. Kendall Elementary School, in [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] is named for him.

==Early life and education==
Kendall was born in [[South Norwalk, Connecticut]] in 1886.  He attended [[Columbia University]], earning a Bachelor of Science degree in 1908, a Master of Science degree in Chemistry in 1909, and a Ph.D. in Chemistry in 1910.<ref name=nobelbio>{{cite web|title=Edward C.

==Research career==
After obtaining his Ph.D., his first job was in research for Parke, Davis and  Company, and his first task was to isolate the hormone associated with the [[thyroid gland]].<ref name=bio>{{cite journal|title=Edward C. Kendall|url=http://www.nap.edu/html/biomems/ekendall.pdf|publisher=National Academy of Sciences|last=Ingle|first=Dwight|journal=Biographical Memoirs of the National Academy of Sciences|year=1974|volume=47|pages=249–90|pmid=11615626}}</ref>  He continued this research at St. Luke's Hospital in New York until 1914.<ref name=nobelbio />  He was appointed Head of the Biochemistry Section in the  Graduate School of the [[Mayo Foundation]], and the following year he was appointed as the Director of the  Division of Biochemistry.<ref name=nobelbio />

Kendall made several notable contributions to biochemistry and medicine.  His most notable discovery was the isolation of [[thyroxine]], although it was not the work he received the most accolades for.<ref name=asbmb>{{cite web|title=1926 Edward C Kendall|url=http://www.asbmb.org/uploadedfiles/aboutus/asbmb_history/past_presidents/1920s/1926Kendall.html|publisher=American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology|access-date=2011-07-04}}</ref>  Along with associates, Kendall was involved with the isolation of [[glutathione]] and determining its structure.<ref name=bio />  He also isolated several steroids from the [[adrenal gland]] cortex, one of which was initially called Compound E.  Working with [[Mayo Clinic]] physician [[Philip Showalter Hench]], Compound E was used to treat [[rheumatoid arthritis]].  The compound was eventually named [[cortisone]].<ref name=nobelbio />  In 1950, Kendall and Hench, along with Swiss chemist [[Tadeus Reichstein]] were awarded the 1950 [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] for "their discoveries relating to the hormones of the adrenal cortex, their structure and biological effects."<ref name=nobelsummary>{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, 1950|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/1950/|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|access-date=2011-07-04}}</ref>  His Nobel lecture focused on the basic research that led to his award, and was titled "The Development of Cortisone As a Therapeutic Agent."<ref name=nobellecture>{{cite web|title=Edward C.

Kendall's career at Mayo ended in 1951, when he reached mandatory retirement age.  He moved on to [[Princeton University]], where he was a Visiting Professor in the Department of Biochemistry.<ref name=nobelbio />  He remained affiliated with Princeton until his death in 1972.<ref name=asbmb /> In addition to the Nobel Prize, Kendall received other major awards including the [[Lasker Award]], the [[Passano Foundation]] Award and the [[Cameron Prize for Therapeutics of the University of Edinburgh]].<ref name=nobelbio />{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}  Kendall received the Golden Plate Award of the [[Academy of Achievement|American Academy of Achievement]] in 1966.<ref>{{cite web|title= Golden Plate Awardees of the American Academy of Achievement |website=www.achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://achievement.org/our-history/golden-plate-awards/#science-exploration}}</ref> He was awarded honorary doctorates from the [[University of Cincinnati]], [[Western Reserve University]], [[Williams College]], [[Yale University]], [[Columbia University]], [[National University of Ireland]], and [[Gustavus Adolphus College]].<ref name=bio />

==Family life==
Kendall married Rebecca Kennedy in 1915, and they had four children.<ref name=nobelbio />  He died in 1972 in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].<ref name=asbmb /> and his wife died in 1973.
