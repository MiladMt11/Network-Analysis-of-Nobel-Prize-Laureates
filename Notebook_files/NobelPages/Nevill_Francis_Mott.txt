'''Sir Nevill Francis Mott''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|CH|FRS}} (30 September 1905 – 8 August 1996) was a British [[physics|physicist]] who won the [[Nobel Prize for Physics]] in 1977 for his work on the electronic structure of magnetic and [[Amorphous solid|disordered]] systems, especially [[amorphous semiconductors]]. The award was shared with [[Philip Warren Anderson|Philip W. Anderson]] and [[John Hasbrouck Van Vleck|J. H. Van Vleck]]. The three had conducted loosely related research. Mott and Anderson clarified the reasons why magnetic or amorphous materials can sometimes be metallic and sometimes insulating.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/archive/scientists/10606.shtml BBC video] of Mott interviewed by [[Lewis Wolpert]] in 1985 (accessed 8 October 2010)</ref><ref>* {{Nobelprize}} including the Nobel Lecture, December 8, 1977 ''Electrons in Glass''

== Education and early life ==
Mott was born in [[Leeds]] to Lilian Mary Reynolds and [[Charles Francis Mott]] and grew up first in the village of [[Giggleswick]], in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]], where his father was Senior Science Master at [[Giggleswick School]].  His mother also taught Maths at the School.  The family moved (due to his father's jobs) first to Staffordshire, then to Chester and finally Liverpool, where his father had been appointed Director of Education. Mott was at first educated at home by his mother, who was a Cambridge Mathematics Tripos graduate. His parents had met in the [[Cavendish Laboratory]], when both were engaged in physics research. At age ten, he began formal education at [[Clifton College]] in Bristol,<ref>"Clifton College Register" Muirhead, J.A.O. p368: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948</ref> then at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], where he read the [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos|Mathematics Tripos]].

== Career and research ==
Mott was appointed a Lecturer in the [[School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester|Physics Department]] at the [[University of Manchester]] in 1929. He returned to Cambridge in 1930 as a Fellow and lecturer of [[Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge|Gonville and Caius College]], and in 1933 moved to the [[University of Bristol]] as Melville Wills Professor in Theoretical Physics.

In 1948 he became [[Henry Overton Wills]] Professor of Physics and Director of the [[Henry Herbert Wills]] Physical Laboratory at Bristol. In 1954 he was appointed [[Cavendish Professor of Physics]] at Cambridge, a post he held until 1971. He was instrumental in the painful cancellation of the planned [[particle accelerator]] because of its very high cost. He also served as Master of [[Gonville and Caius College]], 1959–1966.

His early works were on the theoretical analysis of collisions in gases, notably the [[Hydrogen line|collision with spin flip of an electron against a hydrogen atom]], which would stimulate subsequent works by André Blandin and [[Jun Kondo]] about similar effects between [[Conduction band|conduction electrons]], as well as magnetic properties in metals. This sort of activity led Mott to writing two books. The first one, which was edited together with [[Ian Sneddon]], gives a simple and clear description of quantum mechanics, with an emphasis on the [[Schrödinger equation]] in [[Position and momentum space|real space]]. The second describes atomic and electronic collisions in gases, using the rotational symmetry of [[Energy level|electronic states]] in the [[Hartree–Fock method]].

But already in the middle of the 1930s, Mott's interests had broadened to include solid states, leading to two more books that would have a great impact on the development of the field in the years prior and after [[World War II]]. In 1936, ''Theory of the Properties of  Metals and Alloys'' (written together with H. Jones) describes a simplified framework which led to rapid progress.{{elucidate|date=October 2013}}

The concept of [[Nearly free electron model|nearly free valence electrons]] in metallic alloys explained the special stability of the [[Hume-Rothery rules|Hume-Rothery phases]] if the [[Fermi surface|Fermi sphere]] of the ''sp'' [[Valence electron]], treated as free, would be scattered by the [[Brillouin zone]] boundaries of the atomic structure. The description of the impurities in metals by the [[Thomas–Fermi model|Thomas Fermi approximation]] would explain why such impurities would not interact at long range. Finally the delocalisation of the [[d electron count|valence ''d'' electrons]] in [[Transition metal|transitional metals]] and alloys would explain the possibility for the [[magnetic moment]]s of atoms to be expressed as fractions of [[Bohr magneton]]s, leading to [[Ferromagnetism|ferro]] or [[Antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic]] coupling at short range. This last contribution, produced at the first international conference on magnetism, held in [[Strasbourg]] in May 1939, reinforced similar points of view defended at the time in France by the future Nobel laureate [[Louis Néel]]. In 1949, Mott suggested to [[Jacques Friedel]] to use the approach developed together with Marvey for a more accurate description of the [[electric-field screening]] of the impurity in a metal, leading to the characteristic long range charge oscillations. Friedel also used the concept developed in that book of virtual bound level to describe a situation when the atomic potential considered is not quite strong enough to create a (real) bound level of symmetry e ≠ o.{{elucidate|date=October 2013}} The consequences of these remarks on the more exact approaches of cohesion in rp as well as d metals were mostly developed by his students in Orsay.{{elucidate|date=October 2013}}

The second book, with [[Ronald Wilfred Gurney]], ''On the Physical Chemistry of Solids'' was more wide-ranging. It treated notably of the oxidation of metals at low temperatures, where it described the growth of the oxide layer as due to the electric field developed between the metal and absorbed oxygen ions, which could force the way of metallic or oxygen ions through a disordered oxide layer. The book also analysed the photographic reactions in ionic silver compound in terms of precipitation of silver ions into metallic clusters.

This second field had a direct and long lasting consequence on the research activity of John (Jack) Mitchell. Mott's accomplishments include explaining theoretically the effect of light on a [[film stock|photographic emulsion]] (see [[latent image]]). His work on oxidation, besides fostering new research in the field (notably by J. Bénard and [[Nicolás Cabrera]]), was the root of the concept of the [[band gap]] produced in semiconductors by gradients in the distribution of [[Doping (semiconductor)|donor and acceptor impurities]].

During the war Mott worked on the role of plastic deformation in the progression of fracture cracks. When he returned to Bristol after the war, his having met and hired [[Frederick Charles Frank]] enabled the two of them to make considerable advances in the study of [[dislocation|dislocations]], with the help of others such as [[Frank Nabarro]] and [[Alan Cottrell]]. Bristol became an important centre of research in this topic, especially at the end of the 1940s. If Mott only produced early and somewhat minor contributions to that field, notably on alloy hardening with Nabarro and on the topology of a dislocation network lowering the apparent elastic constants of a crystal, there is no doubt that Mott's enthusiasm played its role in the three major steps forward in the field by F. C. Frank on crystal growth and plasticity and later, in Cambridge, by P. Hirsch on thin film [[electron microscopy]].

At the same time, however, Mott gave a lot of thought to [[electronic correlation]]s and their possible role in [[DLVO theory|Verwey's compounds]] such as nickel oxides which could switch from metals to nonmetallic insulators under various physical conditions - this is known as the [[Mott transition]]. The term [[Mott insulator]] is also named for him, as well as the [[Mott polynomials]], which he introduced.

=== Publications ===
N. F. Mott revived the old [[Philosophical Magazine]] and transformed it into a lively publication essentially centred on the then-new field of solid state physics, attracting writers, readers and general interest on a wide scale. After receiving a paper on point defects in crystals by [[Frederick Seitz]] that was obviously too long for the journal, Mott decided to create a new publication, [[Advances in Physics]], for such review papers. Both publications are still active in 2017.
