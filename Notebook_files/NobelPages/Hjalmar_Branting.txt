'''Karl Hjalmar Branting''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈjǎlmar ˈbrânːtɪŋ|-|sv-Hjalmar_Branting.ogg}}; 23 November 1860 – 24 February 1925) was a Swedish politician who was the leader of the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] (1907–1925) and [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]] during three separate periods (1920, 1921–1923 and 1924–1925). When Branting came to power in [[1920 Swedish general election|1920]], he was the first Social Democratic Prime Minister of Sweden. When taking office for a second term after the [[1921 Swedish general election|general election of 1921]], he became the first [[socialist]] politician in Europe to do so following elections with [[universal suffrage]]. In 1921, Branting shared the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] with the Norwegian secretary-general of the Inter-Parliamentary Union [[Christian Lous Lange]].

== Biography ==
Born to the professor [[Lars Gabriel Branting]] and the noblewoman and pianist [[Emma af Georgii]], Branting was educated in [[Stockholm]] and at [[Uppsala University]]. He developed a scientific background in mathematical astronomy and was an assistant at the [[Stockholm Observatory]], but gave up his devotion to scientific work to become a journalist in 1884 and began editing the newspapers ''Tiden'' and ''Social-Demokraten''. The latter was official media outlet of the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Jonas Harvard|title=Socialist communication strategies and the spring of 1917|journal=Scandinavian Journal of History|date=2019|volume=44 |issue=2|page=174|doi=10.1080/03468755.2018.1500394|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/03468755.2018.1500394}}</ref> His decision to publish an article by the more radical socialist [[Axel Danielsson]], a piece denounced by opponents as insulting to religious sensitivities, resulted in political convictions for [[blasphemy]] and imprisonment for both men.<ref name="Enander 2009">Enander, Crister (14 December 2009).

Together with [[August Palm]], Branting was one of the main organizers of the Swedish Social Democratic Party in 1889. He was its first [[Riksdag|Member of Parliament]] from 1896 and for six years the only one.

In the early years of the 20th century, Branting led the Social Democrats in opposing a war to keep [[Norway]] united with Sweden. When the [[Norway in 1905|crisis]] came in 1905, he coined the slogan "Hands off Norway, King!" The Social Democrats organized resistance to a call-up of reserves and a general strike against a war and are credited with a substantial share in preventing one.

Branting accepted [[Eduard Bernstein]]'s [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revision of Marxism]] and became a [[reformism|reformist]] [[socialist]], advocating a peaceful transition from [[capitalism]] towards [[socialism]]. He believed that if workers were given the vote, this could be achieved by parliamentary ways. Branting supported the [[February Revolution]] in Russia in 1917. He was pro-[[Menshevik]] and defended the government of [[Alexander Kerensky]], whom he even personally visited in [[Petrograd]].

When the [[October Revolution]] broke out the same year, Branting condemned the [[Bolshevik]] seizure of power. 1917 saw a split in the Swedish Social Democratic Party on this question, and the [[Young Left (Sweden)|youth league]] and the revolutionary sections of the party broke away and formed the [[Left Party (Sweden)|Social Democratic Left Party of Sweden]], headed by [[Zeth Höglund]]. This group soon became the Swedish Communist Party. Höglund later returned to the Social Democratic Party and wrote a two-volume biography about Branting.

As Prime Minister, Branting brought Sweden into the [[League of Nations]] and was personally active as a delegate within it. When the question of whether [[Åland]] should be handed over to Sweden after the independence of [[Finland]] from [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russia]] was brought up, he let the League of Nation decide upon the issue. He was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1921 for his work in the League of Nations, sharing the prize with the Norwegian [[Christian Lous Lange]].

Branting is commemorated by the [[Branting Monument]] in Stockholm. Additionally in [[Gothenburg]], there is a tram and bus interchange named after Branting ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]: Hjalmar Brantingsplatsen). Stockholms Plads (Stockholm Square) in [[Copenhagen]] was renamed [[Hjalmar Brantings Plads]] in 1925.
