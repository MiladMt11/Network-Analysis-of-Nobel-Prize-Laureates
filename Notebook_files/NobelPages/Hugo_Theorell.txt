He was born in [[Linköping]] as the son of Thure Theorell and his wife Armida Bill. Theorell went to Secondary School at [[Katedralskolan (Linköping)|Katedralskolan]] in Linköping and passed his examination there on 23 May 1921. In September, he began to study medicine at the [[Karolinska Institute]] and in 1924 he graduated as a Bachelor of Medicine. He then spent three months studying [[bacteriology]] at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in [[Paris]] under Professor [[Albert Calmette]]. In 1930 he obtained his M.D. degree with a theory on the lipids of the blood plasma, and was appointed professor in physiological chemistry at the Karolinska Institute.

Theorell, who dedicated his entire career to enzyme research, received the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1955 for discovering [[Oxidoreductase|oxidoreductase]] enzymes and their effects. His contribution also consisted of the theory of the toxic effects of sodium fluoride on the cofactors of  crucial human enzymes. In 1936 he was appointed Head of the newly established Biochemical Department of the Nobel Medical Institute,<ref>{{cite web

His work had led to pioneering progress on [[Alcohol dehydrogenase|alcohol dehydrogenases]], enzymes that break down alcohol in the liver and other tissues. <!--His work won praise in Sweden as well as around the world.--> He received honorary degrees at universities in [[France]], [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]] and the [[United States]]. <!--{{Clarification|medical research?|date=June 2018}}-->

Theorell died in Stockholm and is interred in [[Norra Begravningsplatsen|Norra begravningsplatsen]] (The Northern Cemetery) alongside his wife, Elin Margit Elisabeth (née Alenius) Theorell, a distinguished pianist and harpsichordist who died in 2002.
