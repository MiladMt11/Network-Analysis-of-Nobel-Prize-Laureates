'''Ferdinand Frédéric Henri Moissan''' (28 September 1852 – 20 February 1907) was a French chemist and pharmacist who won the 1906 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his work in isolating [[fluorine]] from its compounds. Moissan was one of the original members of the [[Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights|International Atomic Weights Committee]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.crci.2016.06.005 |title=Ferdinand Frédéric Henri Moissan: The first French Nobel Prize winner in chemistry or nec pluribus impar |journal=Comptes Rendus Chimie |volume=19 |issue=9 |pages=1027–32 |year=2016 |last1=Fechete |first1=Ioana |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Viel |first1=C. |title=Henri Moissan : l'homme, le collectionneur, l'enseignant |trans-title=Henri Moissan: the man, the collector, the teacher |language=fr |journal=Annales Pharmaceutiques Françaises |date=January 2008 |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=34–38 |doi=10.1016/j.pharma.2007.12.006 |pmid=18435984 }}</ref>

==Biography==
Moissan was born in [[Paris]] on 28 September 1852, the son of a minor officer of the [[Chemins de Fer de l'Est|eastern railway company]], Francis Ferdinand Moissan, and a seamstress, Joséphine Améraldine (née Mitel).<ref name="Greffe">{{cite web |first=Florence |last=Greffe |date=18 November 2004 |url=http://www.academie-sciences.fr/activite/archive/dossiers/fonds_pdf/Fonds_Moissan.pdf |title=Fonds 62 J HENRI MOISSAN |publisher=Institut de France Academie des Sciences |access-date=3 March 2021 |language=fr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109010820/http://www.academie-sciences.fr/activite/archive/dossiers/fonds_pdf/Fonds_Moissan.pdf |archive-date=9 November 2013 }}</ref> His mother was of Jewish descent,<ref name=":0">{{cite journal |last1=Wisniak |first1=Jaime |title=Henri Moissan.

In 1870 he left the school without the ''grade universitaire'' necessary to attend university. Moissan became a trainee in pharmacy in 1871 and in 1872 he started working for a chemist in Paris, where he was able to save a person poisoned with [[arsenic]]. He decided to study chemistry and began first at the laboratory of [[Edmond Frémy]] and later at that of [[Pierre Paul Dehérain]]. Dehérain persuaded him to pursue an academic career. He passed the [[baccalauréat]], which was necessary to study at university, in 1874 after an earlier failed attempt. He also became qualified as first-class pharmacist at the École Supérieure de Pharmacie in 1879, and received his doctoral degree from the Faculté des Sciences in 1880. During his time in Paris he became a friend of the chemist [[Alexandre Étard|Alexandre Léon Étard]] and the botanist Vasque.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lafont |first1=O. |title=De l'apprentissage au Prix Nobel : le fabuleux destin d'Henri Moissan |trans-title=From apprenticeship to Nobel Prize: Henri Moissan's fabulous destiny |language=fr |journal=Annales Pharmaceutiques Françaises |date=1 January 2008 |volume=66 |issue=1 |pages=28–33 |doi=10.1016/j.pharma.2007.12.004 |pmid=18435983 }}</ref>

He published his first scientific paper, about [[carbon dioxide]] and [[oxygen]] metabolism in plants, with Dehérain in 1874. He left plant physiology and then turned towards inorganic chemistry; subsequently his research on pyrophoric iron was well received by the two most prominent French inorganic chemists of that time, [[Henri Etienne Sainte-Claire Deville]] and [[Jules Henri Debray]]. After Moissan received his Ph.D. on cyanogen and its reactions to form cyanures in 1880, his friend Landrine offered him a position at an analytic laboratory. His marriage, to Léonie Lugan, took place in 1882. They had a son in 1885, named Louis Ferdinand Henri.<ref name="Greffe"/>

During the 1880s, Moissan focused on fluorine chemistry and especially the production of fluorine itself. He had no laboratory of his own, but used several laboratories, for example that of [[Charles Friedel]]. There he had access to a strong battery consisting of 90 [[Bunsen cell]]s which made it possible to observe a gas produced by the electrolysis of molten [[arsenic trichloride]]; the gas was reabsorbed by the arsenic trichloride. The electrolysis of [[hydrogen fluoride]] yielded [[fluorine]] on 26 June 1886. The French academy of science sent three representatives, [[Marcellin Berthelot]], Henri Debray, and [[Edmond Frémy]], to verify the results, but Moissan was unable to reproduce them, owing to the absence from the hydrogen fluoride of traces of potassium fluoride present in the previous experiments. After resolving the problem and demonstrating the production of fluorine several times, he was awarded a prize of 10,000 francs. In subsequent years, until 1891, he focused on the study of fluorine chemistry. He discovered numerous fluorine compounds, such as (together with [[Paul Lebeau]]) [[sulfur hexafluoride|SF<sub>6</sub>]] in 1901. His research in the production of [[boron]] and artificial [[diamond]]s and the development of an electrically heated oven capable of reaching 3500&nbsp;°C using 2200 amperes at 80 volts followed by 1900.<ref name="Nobel">{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/1906/moissan/biographical/|title=Henri Moissan – Facts|website=NobelPrize.org|access-date=6 May 2020}}</ref>

His newly developed arc furnace led to the production of [[boride]]s and [[carbide]]s of numerous elements (e.g. [[silicon boride]]), another of his research areas.<ref name="Nobel" />

===Research===

====Preparation of elemental fluorine====
[[File:Moissan color images.jpg|thumb|Moissan's 1892 observation of the color of fluorine gas (2), compared to air (1) and chlorine (3)]]
The existence of the element [[fluorine]] had been well known for many years, but all attempts to isolate it had failed, and some experimenters had died in the attempt.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Toon |first=Richard |title=The discovery of fluorine |date=1 September 2011 |magazine=[[Education in Chemistry]] |publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]] |volume=48 |issue=5 |pages=148–151 |url=https://eic.rsc.org/feature/the-discovery-of-fluorine/2020249.article}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1 = Weeks|first1 = Mary Elvira|author-link1=Mary Elvira Weeks|title = The discovery of the elements.

Moissan eventually succeeded in preparing fluorine in 1886 by the [[electrolysis]] of a [[Solution (chemistry)|solution]] of [[potassium hydrogen difluoride]] (KHF<sub>2</sub>) in liquid [[hydrogen fluoride]] (HF).  The mixture was needed because hydrogen fluoride is a nonconductor. The device was built with [[platinum]]/[[iridium]] electrodes in a platinum holder and  the apparatus was cooled to −50&nbsp;°C. The result was the complete isolation of the hydrogen produced at the negative [[electrode]] from the fluorine produced at the positive one.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Action d'un courant électrique sur l'acide fluorhydrique anhydre |trans-title=The action of an electric current on anhydrous hydrofluoric acid |language=fr | author=H.

For this achievement, he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in 1906. Late in his life, the government of France named him a [[Commandeur de la Legion d'honneur]].

====Further studies====

Moissan went on to study fluorine chemistry in great detail, contributed to the development of the [[electric arc furnace]] and attempted to use pressure to synthesize [[diamond]]s <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.europeana.eu/resolve/record/9200103/DFC747FFF8685A0BF20C75ACFABB1D6DCCAEA54B |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130213074128/http://www.europeana.eu/resolve/record/9200103/DFC747FFF8685A0BF20C75ACFABB1D6DCCAEA54B |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 February 2013 |title=Le diamant : conférence faite à la Société des amis de la science le 17 mai 1893 |trans-title=The diamond: lecture to the Society of Friends of Science 17 May 1893 |language=fr |year=1893 |author=Moissan, Henri |access-date=27 June 2012 |publisher=Europeana }}</ref> from the more common form of [[carbon]].  In 1893, Moissan began studying fragments of a meteorite found in [[Meteor Crater]] near [[Canyon Diablo (canyon)|Diablo Canyon]] in [[Arizona]].  In these fragments he discovered minute quantities of a new mineral and, after extensive research, Moissan concluded that this mineral was made of [[silicon carbide]]. In 1905, this mineral was named [[moissanite]], in his honor. In 1903 Moissan was elected member of the [[Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights|International Atomic Weights Committee]] where he served until his death.<ref name="ciaaw-history">{{cite web|url=http://www.iupac.org/publications/ci/2004/2601/1_holden.html|title=Atomic Weights and the International Committee—A Historical Review|publisher=Chemistry International|year=2004}}</ref>

====Death====
He died suddenly in [[Paris]] in February 1907, shortly after his return from receiving the Nobel Prize in [[Stockholm]]. His death was attributed to an acute case of appendicitis.
