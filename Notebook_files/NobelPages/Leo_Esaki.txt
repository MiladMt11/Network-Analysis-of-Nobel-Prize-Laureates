'''Reona Esaki''' (江崎 玲於奈 ''Esaki Reona'', born March 12, 1925), also known as '''Leo Esaki''', is a [[Japan]]ese physicist who shared the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] in 1973 with [[Ivar Giaever]] and [[Brian David Josephson]] for his work in [[electron tunneling]] in semiconductor materials which finally led to his invention of the [[Esaki diode]], which exploited that phenomenon. This research was done when he was with Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo (now known as [[Sony]]). He has also contributed in being a pioneer of the semiconductor [[superlattice]]s.<ref name=jp/>

==Early life and education==
Esaki was born in Takaida-mura, Nakakawachi-gun, [[Osaka Prefecture]] (now part of [[Higashiōsaka|Higashiōsaka City]]) and grew up in [[Kyoto]], near by [[Kyoto Imperial University]] and [[Doshisha University]]. He first had contact with [[American culture]] in {{ill|Doshisha Junior High School|ja|同志社中学校・高等学校}}. After graduating from the Third Higher School, he studied [[physics]] at [[Tokyo Imperial University]], where he had attended [[Hideki Yukawa]]'s course in [[nuclear physics|nuclear theory]] in October 1944. Also, he lived through the [[Bombing of Tokyo]] while he was at college.<ref name="Bio">江崎玲於奈『限界への挑戦―私の履歴書』（日本経済新聞出版社）2007年</ref>

Esaki received his B.Sc. and Ph.D. in 1947 and 1959, respectively, from the [[University of Tokyo]] (UTokyo).

==Career==
===Esaki diode===

[[File:Leo Esaki 1959b.jpg|thumb|Leo Esaki works at Sony on June 27, 1959 in Tokyo, Japan]]
From 1947 to 1960, Esaki joined Kawanishi Corporation (now [[Denso Ten]]) and Tokyo Tsushin Kogyo (now [[Sony]]). Meanwhile, American physicists [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter Brattain]], and [[William Shockley]] invented the [[transistor]], which encouraged Esaki to change fields from [[vacuum tube]] to heavily-doped [[germanium]] and [[silicon]] research in Sony. One year later, he recognized that when the PN junction width of germanium is thinned, the current-voltage characteristic is dominated by the influence of the tunnel effect and, as a result, he discovered that as the voltage is increased, the current decreases inversely, indicating negative resistance. This discovery was the first demonstration of solid tunneling effects in physics, and it was the birth of new electronic devices in electronics called [[Esaki diode]] (or tunnel diode). He received a doctorate degree from UTokyo due to this breakthrough invention in 1959.

In 1973, Esaki was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]]<ref>Esaki, Leo, "Long Journey into Tunneling," [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1973/esaki-lecture.html Nobel Lecture], December 12, 1973.</ref> for research conducted around 1958 regarding electron tunneling<ref>{{Cite journal| first1 = L.| title = New Phenomenon in Narrow Germanium p-n Junctions| last1 = Esaki| journal = Physical Review| volume = 109| issue = 2| pages = 603| year = 1958 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.109.603|bibcode = 1958PhRv..109..603E }}</ref> in solids. He became the first [[Nobel laureate]] to receive the prize from the hands of the King [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|Carl XVI Gustaf]].

===Semiconductor superlattice===
Esaki moved to the [[United States]] in 1960 and joined the [[IBM]] [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center|T. J. Watson Research Center]], where he became an [[IBM Fellow]] in 1967. He predicted that semiconductor [[superlattices]] will be formed to induce a differential negative-resistance effect via an artificially one-dimensional periodic structural changes in semiconductor crystals. His unique "molecular beam epitaxy" thin-film crystal growth method can be regulated quite precisely in ultrahigh vacuum. His first paper on the semiconductor superlattice<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1147/rd.141.0061|title=Superlattice and Negative Differential Conductivity in Semiconductors|year=1970|last1=Esaki|first1=L.|last2=Tsu|first2=R.|journal=IBM Journal of Research and Development|volume=14|pages=61–65}}</ref> was published in 1970. A 1987 comment by Esaki regarding the original paper notes:
<blockquote>
"The original version of the paper was rejected for publication by ''[[Physical Review]]'' on the referee's unimaginative assertion that it was 'too speculative' and involved 'no new physics.' However, this proposal was quickly accepted by the Army Research Office..."<ref>"This Weeks's Citation Classic", ''[[Current Contents]]'' No 28, July 13, 1987.</ref>
</blockquote>

In 1972, Esaki realized his concept of superlattices in III-V group semiconductors, later the concept influenced many fields like metals, and magnetic materials. He was awarded the [[IEEE Medal of Honor]] "for contributions to and leadership in tunneling, semiconductor superlattices, and quantum wells"<ref>{{Cite web |title=IEEE Medal of Honor Recipients |url=http://www.ieee.org/documents/moh_rl.pdf|date=April 22, 2015|access-date=August 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150422004457/http://www.ieee.org/documents/moh_rl.pdf|archive-date=April 22, 2015}}</ref> in 1991 and the [[Japan Prize]] "for the creation and realization of the concept of man-made superlattice crystals which lead to generation of new materials with useful applications" in 1998.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.japanprize.jp/en/prize_prof_1998_esaki.html|title=The Japan Prize Foundation|website=www.japanprize.jp|access-date=August 9, 2019}}</ref>

==Esaki's “five don’ts” rules==
In 1994 [[Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings]], Esaki suggests a list of “five don’ts” which anyone in realizing his creative potential should follow. Two months later,  the chairman of the Nobel Committee for Physics [[Carl Nordling]] incorporated the rules in his own speech.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/0031-8949/1995/T59/001|bibcode=1995PhST...59...21N|url=https://web.stanford.edu/~rotundu/documents/how_to_get_it.pdf|title=How to get the Nobel Prize in physics|year=1995|last1=Nordling|first1=Carl|journal=Physica Scripta|volume=59|pages=21–25}}</ref><ref name="Bio"/>

#Don't allow yourself to be trapped by your past experiences.
#Don't allow yourself to become overly attached to any one authority in your field – the great professor, perhaps.
#Don't hold on to what you don't need.
#Don't avoid confrontation.
#Don't forget your spirit of childhood curiosity.

==Later years==
In 1977, Esaki was elected as a member into the [[National Academy of Engineering]] for contributions to the engineering of semiconductor devices.

Esaki moved back to [[Japan]] in 1992. Subsequently, he served as president of the [[University of Tsukuba]]<ref name=jp/> and [[Shibaura Institute of Technology]]. Since 2006 he is the president of [[Yokohama College of Pharmacy]]. Esaki is also the recipient of The International Center in New York's Award of Excellence, the [[Order of Culture]] (1974) and the Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Rising Sun]] (1998).

In recognition of three [[Nobel laureates]]' contributions, the bronze statues of [[Shin'ichirō Tomonaga]], Leo Esaki, and [[Makoto Kobayashi (physicist)|Makoto Kobayashi]] were set up in the Central Park of Azuma 2 in [[Tsukuba City]] in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mainichi.jp/feature/news/m20150316ddlk08040111000c.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424074404/http://mainichi.jp/feature/news/m20150316ddlk08040111000c.html|url-status=dead|title=ノーベル賞:江崎、小林、朝永氏の銅像やレリーフ設置 完成記念式でお披露目 「子どもが夢を」−−つくば・中央公園 ／茨城 - 毎日新聞|archive-date=April 24, 2015|access-date=August 9, 2019}}</ref>

After the death of [[Yoichiro Nambu]] in 2015, Esaki is the eldest [[Japanese Nobel laureate]].

His daughter, Ana Esaki, is married to [[Craig S. Smith]], former [[Shanghai]] bureau chief of ''[[The New York Times]]'' and [[China]] bureau chief of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|date=1990-01-14|title=Anna Esaki Wed To Craig S.
