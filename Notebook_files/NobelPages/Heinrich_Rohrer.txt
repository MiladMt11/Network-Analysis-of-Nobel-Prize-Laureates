}}'''Heinrich Rohrer''' (6 June 1933 – 16 May 2013) was a Swiss [[physicist]] who shared half of the 1986 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] with [[Gerd Binnig]] for the design of the [[scanning tunneling microscope]] (STM). The other half of the Prize was awarded to [[Ernst Ruska]].<ref>{{Nobelprize|accessdate=20 April 2020}} including the Nobel Lecture, December 8, 1986 ''Scanning Tunneling Microscopy – From Birth to Adolescence''

==Biography==
Rohrer was born in [[Buchs, St. Gallen]] half an hour after his twin sister. He enjoyed a carefree country childhood until the family moved to [[Zürich]] in 1949. He enrolled in the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]] (ETH) in 1951, where he was student of [[Wolfgang Pauli]] and [[Paul Scherrer]]. His PhD thesis was supervised by Prof P. Grassmann who worked on [[cryogenic engineering]]. Rohrer measured the length changes of superconductors at the magnetic-field-induced superconducting transition, a project begun by Jørgen Lykke Olsen. In the course of his research, he found that he had to do most of his research at night after the city was asleep because his measurements were so sensitive to vibration.

His studies were interrupted by his military service in the Swiss mountain infantry. In 1961, he married Rose-Marie Egger. Their honeymoon trip to the [[United States]] included a stint doing research on thermal conductivity of type-II superconductors and metals with Bernie Serin at [[Rutgers University]] in [[New Jersey]].

In 1963, he joined the [[IBM]] Research Laboratory in [[Rüschlikon]] under the direction of [[Ambros Speiser]]. The first couple of years at IBM, he studied Kondo systems with magnetoresistance in pulsed magnetic fields. He then began studying magnetic phase diagrams, which eventually brought him into the field of critical phenomena.

In 1974, he spent a [[sabbatical]] year at the [[University of California]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]] studying [[nuclear magnetic resonance]] with Vince Jaccarino and Alan King.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Until 1982 he worked on the scanning tunneling microscope. He was appointed [[IBM Fellow]] in 1986, and led the physics department of the research lab from 1986 until 1988. Rohrer was elected an honorary academician of [[Academia Sinica]] in 2008.<ref>{{cite news |title=Heinrich Rohrer |url=https://academicians.sinica.edu.tw/index.php?r=academician-n%2Fshow&id=592&_lang=en |access-date=3 December 2019 |publisher=Academia Sinica}}</ref>

===Death===
Rohrer died of natural causes on 16 May 2013 at his home in [[Wollerau, Switzerland]], aged 79.<ref>{{cite web|title=Heinrich Rohrer dies at 79; a father of nanotechnology|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-me-0524-heinrich-rohrer-20130524,0,6312102.story|work=LA Times|access-date=25 May 2013|date=2013-05-24}}</ref><ref name="economist">[https://www.economist.com/news/obituary/21578630-heinrich-rohrer-father-nanotechnology-died-may-16th-aged-79-heinrich-rohrer?fsrc=nlw|hig|5-30-2013|5803230|34573600  Heinrich Rohrer obituary, The Economist June 2013]</ref>
