Their technique was used for high precision measurement of the [[electron]] [[magnetic moment]].

==Biography==
At the age of ten Dehmelt enrolled in the [[Berlinisches Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster]], a [[Latin language|Latin]] school in [[Berlin]], where he was admitted on a scholarship.<ref name=sandomir>{{citation |last=Sandomir |first=Richard |title=Hans Dehmelt, Nobel Laureate for Isolating Electrons, Dies at 94 | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 9, 2017 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/09/science/hans-dehmelt-dies-nobel-laureate-physics.html}}</ref> After graduating in 1940, he volunteered for service in the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]], which ordered him to attend the [[University of Breslau]] to study physics in 1943. After a year of study he returned to army service and was captured during the [[Battle of the Bulge]].

After his release from an American prisoner of war camp in 1946, Dehmelt returned to his study of physics at the [[University of Göttingen]], where he supported himself by repairing and bartering old, pre-war radio sets. He completed his master's thesis in 1948 and received his PhD in 1950, both from the University of Göttingen. He was then invited to [[Duke University]] as a postdoctoral associate, emigrating in 1952.  Dehmelt became an assistant professor at the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle, Washington]] in 1955, an associate professor in 1958, and a full professor in 1961.<ref name="UW Today">{{cite news |last=Urton |first=James |url=http://www.washington.edu/news/2017/03/21/hans-dehmelt-nobel-laureate-and-uw-professor-emeritus-has-died-at-age-94/ |title=Hans Dehmelt — Nobel laureate and UW professor emeritus — has died at age 94 |work=UW Today |publisher= University of Washington |date=2017-03-21 }}</ref>

In 1955 he built his first electron impact tube in [[George Volkoff]]'s laboratory at the [[University of British Columbia]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1989/dehmelt-autobio.html|title=Hans G. Dehmelt - Biographical|website=Nobelprize.org|access-date=2017-03-15}}</ref> and experimented on paramagnetic resonances in polarized atoms and free electrons.  In the 1960s, Dehmelt and his students worked on spectroscopy of hydrogen and helium ions.  The electron was finally isolated in 1973 with David Wineland, who continued work on trapped ions at NIST.

He created the first [[geonium atom]] in 1976, which he then used to measure precise magnetic moments of the electron and positron with R. S. Van Dyck into the 1980s, work that led to his Nobel prize.  In 1979 Dehmelt led a team that took the first photo of a single atom.  He continued work on [[ion trap]]s at the [[University of Washington]], until his retirement in October 2002.

In May 2010, he was honoured as one of Washington's Nobel laureates by [[Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden]] at a special event in Seattle.<ref>{{cite web|last=Trujillo |first=Joshua |url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/thebigblog/2010/05/07/crown-princess-victoria-of-sweden-honors-local-nobel-laureates/ |title=Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden honors local Nobel Laureates - Seattle's Big Blog |website=Blog.seattlepi.com |date=2010-05-07 |access-date=2017-03-15}}</ref>

He was married to Irmgard Lassow, now deceased, and the couple had a son, Gerd, also deceased.  In 1989 Dehmelt married Diana Dundore, a physician.

Dehmelt died on March 7, 2017 in Seattle, Washington, aged 94.<ref name=seattlepi>{{cite news|title=King County deaths| newspaper=[[The Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=March 13, 2017 |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/obits/article/King-County-deaths-03-10-2017-10997885.php}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/seattletimes/obituary.aspx?n=hans-dehmelt&pid=184580043|title=Hans Dehmelt's Obituary on The Seattle Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/education/physicist-hans-dehmelt-the-first-uw-professor-to-win-a-nobel-prize-dies/|title=Physicist Hans Dehmelt, the first UW professor to win a Nobel Prize, dies|date=23 March 2017}}</ref>
