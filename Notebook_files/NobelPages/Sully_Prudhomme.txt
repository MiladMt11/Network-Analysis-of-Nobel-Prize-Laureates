'''René François Armand''' ('''Sully''') '''Prudhomme''' ({{IPA-fr|syli pʁydɔm|lang}}; 16 March 1839 – 6 September 1907) was a French poet and essayist. He was the first winner of the [[1901 Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize in Literature in 1901]].

Born in Paris, Prudhomme originally studied to be an engineer, but turned to philosophy and later to poetry; he declared it as his intention to create scientific poetry for modern times. In character sincere and melancholic, he was linked to the [[Parnassianism|Parnassus school]], although, at the same time, his work displays characteristics of its own.

==Early life==
Prudhomme was born to a French shopkeeper.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1901/prudhomme-bio.html|title=Sully Prudhomme – Biographical|publisher=Nobel Foundation|access-date=13 July 2016}}</ref>

Prudhomme attended the [[Lycée Condorcet|Lycée Bonaparte]], but eye trouble interrupted his studies. He worked for a while in the [[Le Creusot|Creusot]] region for the [[Schneider Electric|Schneider]] steel [[foundry]], and then began studying law in a notary's office. The favourable reception of his early poems by the ''Conférence La Bruyère'' (a student society) encouraged him to begin a literary career.

==Writing==
His first collection, ''Stances et Poèmes'' ("Stanzas and Poems", 1865), was praised by [[Sainte-Beuve]]. It included his most famous poem, ''Le vase brisé''. He published more poetry before the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. This war, which he discussed in ''Impressions de la guerre'' (1872) and ''La France'' (1874), permanently damaged his health.

During his career, Prudhomme gradually shifted from the sentimental style of his first books towards a more personal style which unified the formality of the [[Parnassianism|Parnassus]] school with his interest in philosophical and scientific subjects. One of his inspirations was clearly [[Lucretius]]'s ''[[De rerum natura]]'', whose first book he translated into verse. His philosophy was expressed in ''La Justice'' (1878) and ''Le Bonheur'' (1888). The extreme economy of means employed in these poems has, however, usually been judged as compromising their poetical quality without advancing their claims as works of philosophy. He was elected to the [[Académie française]] in 1881. Another distinction, ''Chevalier de la [[Légion d’honneur]]'', was to follow in 1895.

After ''Le Bonheur'', Prudhomme turned from poetry to write essays on [[aesthetics]] and philosophy. He published two important essays: ''L'Expression dans les beaux-arts'' (1884) and ''Réflexions sur l'art des vers'' (1892), a series of articles on [[Blaise Pascal]] in ''[[La Revue des Deux Mondes]]'' (1890), and an article on [[free will]] (''La Psychologie du Libre-Arbitre'', 1906) in the ''Revue de métaphysique et de morale''.

==Nobel Prize==
{{Main article|1901 Nobel Prize in Literature}}
The first writer to receive the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] (given "in special recognition of his poetic composition, which gives evidence of [[lofty idealism]], artistic perfection and a rare combination of the qualities of both heart and intellect"), he devoted the bulk of the money he received to the creation of a poetry prize awarded by the ''[[Société des gens de lettres]]''. He also founded, in 1902, the ''[[Société des poètes français]]'' with [[Jose-Maria de Heredia]] and [[Leon Dierx]].

==Death==

At the end of his life, his poor health (which had troubled him ever since 1870) forced him to live almost as a [[recluse]] at [[Châtenay-Malabry]], suffering attacks of paralysis while continuing to work on essays. He died suddenly on 6 September 1907, and was buried at [[Père-Lachaise]] in Paris.
