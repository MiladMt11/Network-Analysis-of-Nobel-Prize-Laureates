He won a major scholarship to [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] at a time when advances in [[genetics]] were occurring there and became interested in [[biology]] and [[biochemistry]].{{citation needed|date=December 2016}} He then went to [[University College London]] where he learned laboratory skills supervised by Elizabeth Deuchar. In 1978, he moved to the Department of Genetics, at the [[University of Cambridge]], and in 1980 began his collaboration with [[Matthew Kaufman]]. They explored the method of using [[blastocysts]] for the isolation of embryonic stem cells. After Kaufman left, Evans continued his work, upgrading his laboratory skills to the newest technologies, isolated the embryonic stem cell of the early mouse embryo and established it in a cell culture. He genetically modified and implanted it into adult female mice with the intent of creating genetically modified offspring, work for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in 2007. Today, [[genetically modified]] mice are considered vital for medical research.

==Early life and education==

===Stem cell research===
Evans and Kaufman isolated the [[embryonic stem cell]]s from early embryos ([[embryoblast]]s) of mice and established them in cell cultures. These early embryonic cells have the potential to differentiate into any of the cells of the adult organism. They modified these stem cells genetically and placed them in the wombs of female mice so they would give birth to genetically modified offspring.<ref name="Hansson"/>
 
In 1981, Evans and Kaufman published results for experiments in which they described how they isolated embryonic stem cells from [[mouse]] [[blastocyst]]s and grew them in [[cell culture]]s.<ref name="Hansson">{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2007/adv.html|title=The 2007 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine - Advanced Information|last=Hansson|first=Göran K|publisher=Nobelprize.org|access-date=26 June 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101016091331/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2007/adv.html|archive-date=16 October 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Evans M, Kaufman M | title = Establishment in culture of pluripotential cells from mouse embryos | journal = Nature | volume = 292 | issue = 5819 | pages = 154–6 |date=July 1981 | pmid = 7242681 | doi = 10.1038/292154a0| bibcode = 1981Natur.292..154E | s2cid = 4256553 }}</ref> This was also achieved by [[Gail R.

Evans and his collaborators showed that they could introduce a new [[gene]] into cultured embryonic stem cells and then use such [[Transformation (genetics)|genetically transformed]] cells to make [[Chimera (genetics)|chimeric embryos]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Bradley A, Evans M, Kaufman MH, Robertson E | title = Formation of germ-line chimaeras from embryo-derived teratocarcinoma cell lines | journal = Nature | volume = 309| issue = 5965 | pages = 255–256 | year = 1984 | pmid = 6717601 | doi = 10.1038/309255a0| bibcode = 1984Natur.309..255B | s2cid = 4335599 }}</ref> In some chimeric embryos, the genetically altered stem cells produced [[gamete]]s, thus allowing transmission of the artificially induced [[mutation]] into future generations of mice.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Robertson E | author2 = Bradley, A. | author3 = Kuehn, M. | author4 = Evans, M. | title = Germ-line transmission of genes introduced into cultured pluripotential cells by retroviral vector | journal = Nature | volume = 323| issue = 6087 | pages = 445–448 | year = 1986 | pmid = 3762693 | doi = 10.1038/323445a0| bibcode = 1986Natur.323..445R | s2cid = 4241422 }}</ref> In this way, [[Transgenesis|transgenic]] mice with induced mutations in the enzyme [[Hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase]] (HPRT) were created.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kuehn MR, Bradley A, Robertson EJ, Evans MJ | title = A potential animal model for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome through introduction of HPRT mutations into mice | journal = Nature | volume = 326 | issue = 5819 | pages = 295–298 | year = 1987 | pmid = 3029599 | doi = 10.1038/326295a0| bibcode = 1987Natur.326..295K | s2cid = 1657244 }}</ref> The HPRT mutations were produced by [[retrovirus|retroviral]] insertion; it was proposed that by taking advantage of [[genetic recombination]] between the normal HPRT gene and an artificial gene sequenced added to the cultured embryonic stem cells, "it may also eventually be possible to produce specific alterations in [[endogenous]] genes through [[homologous recombination]] with cloned copies modified in vitro".<ref name="Hansson"/> The production of transgenic mice using this proposed approach was accomplished in the laboratories of [[Oliver Smithies]],<ref>{{cite journal | author = Doetschman T | author2 = Gregg, R.G. | author3 = Maeda, N. | author4 = Hooper, M.L. | author5 = Melton, D.W. | author6 = Thompson, S. | author7 = Smithies, O. | title =Germ-line transmission of a planned alteration made in a hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase gene by homologous recombination in embryonic stem cells
