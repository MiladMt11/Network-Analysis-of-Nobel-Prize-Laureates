'''Barry Clark Barish''' (born January 27, 1936) is an American [[Experimental physics|experimental physicist]] and [[List of Nobel laureates in Physics|Nobel Laureate]]. He is a Linde Professor of Physics, emeritus at [[California Institute of Technology]] and a leading expert on [[gravitational wave]]s.

In 2017, Barish was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] along with [[Rainer Weiss]] and [[Kip Thorne]] "for decisive contributions to the [[LIGO|LIGO detector]] and the observation of gravitational waves".<ref name=nobel>{{cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 2017|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2017/press.html|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|date= October 3, 2017|access-date=October 3, 2017}}</ref><ref name="BBC-20171003">{{cite news |last1=Rincon |first1=Paul |last2=Amos |first2=Jonathan |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-41476648|title=Einstein's waves win Nobel Prize |work=[[BBC News]] |date=October 3, 2017 |access-date=October 3, 2017}}</ref><ref name="NYT-20171003">{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |author-link=Dennis Overbye |title=2017 Nobel Prize in Physics Awarded to LIGO Black Hole Researchers |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/science/nobel-prize-physics.html |date=October 3, 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=October 3, 2017 }}</ref><ref name="NYT-20171003dk">{{cite news |last=Kaiser |first=David |author-link=David Kaiser |title=Learning from Gravitational Waves |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/opinion/gravitational-waves-ligo-funding.html |date=October 3, 2017 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=October 3, 2017 }}</ref>

==Birth and education==
Barish was born in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], the son of Lee and Harold Barish.<ref>https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:K999-5XC</ref> His parents' families were [[Jewish]] immigrants from a part of Poland that is now in Belarus.<ref name=OHO>{{cite web|url=http://oralhistories.library.caltech.edu/178/1/Barish_OHO.pdf |title=Interview with Shirley K.

He attended [[John Marshall High School (Los Angeles)|John Marshall High School]] and other schools.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://home.lausd.net/apps/news/article/762576|title=Marshall High alumnus wins Nobel Prize in Physics|access-date=October 18, 2017}}</ref>

He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in physics (1957) and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in experimental high energy physics (1962) at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name="thesis-barish-1963">{{cite thesis |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/302101760/ |title=A study of the reaction negative pion plus proton going to negative pion plus neutral pion plus proton at 310 and 377 MEV |date=1963 |publisher=[[University of California, Berkeley]] |type=Ph.D. |last=Barish |first=Barry Clark |via=[[ProQuest]] |url-access=subscription  |oclc=16727804}}</ref> He joined [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]] in 1963 as part of a new experimental effort in particle physics using frontier particle accelerators at the national laboratories. From 1963 to 1966, he was a research fellow, and from 1966 to 1991 an Assistant Professor, Associate Professor, and Professor of Physics. From 1991 to 2005, he became Linde Professor of Physics, and after that Linde Professor of Physics, Emeritus.<ref>https://labcit.ligo.caltech.edu/~BCBAct/BCB_CV0316.pdf</ref> From 1984 to 1996, he was the principal investigator of Caltech High Energy Physics Group.

==Research==
Firstly, Barish's experiments were performed at [[Fermilab]] using high-energy neutrino collisions to reveal the quark substructure of the nucleon.<ref>{{cite web|title=CALTECH HEP NEWS

In the 1980s, he directed [[Monopole, Astrophysics and Cosmic Ray Observatory|MACRO]], an experiment in a cave in [[Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso|Gran Sasso]], [[Italy]], that searched for exotic particles called [[magnetic monopole]]s and also studied penetrating [[cosmic rays]], including [[neutrino]] measurements that provided important confirmatory evidence that neutrinos have mass and oscillate.<ref name="science">{{Cite journal|last=Cho|first=Adrian|s2cid=40105741|date=2006-05-26|title=A Quiet Leader Unites Researchers in Drive for the Next Big Machine|journal=Science|language=en|volume=312|issue=5777|pages=1128–1129|doi=10.1126/science.312.5777.1128|issn=0036-8075|pmid=16728609}}</ref>

In 1991, Barish was named the Maxine and Ronald Linde Professor of Physics at Caltech.

In the early 1990s, he spearheaded GEM (Gammas, Electrons, Muons), an experiment that would have run at the [[Superconducting Super Collider]] which was approved after the former project L* led by [[Samuel Ting]] (and Barish as chairman of collaboration board) was rejected by SSC director [[Roy Schwitters]].<ref name=science /><ref name="RiordanHoddeson2015">{{cite book|author1=Michael Riordan|author2=Lillian Hoddeson|author2-link=Lillian Hoddeson|author3=Adrienne W.

Barish became the principal investigator of the [[Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory]] (LIGO) in 1994 and director in 1997.  He led the effort through the approval of funding by the NSF National Science Board in 1994, the construction and commissioning of the LIGO interferometers in Livingston, LA and Hanford, WA in 1997.  He created the [[LIGO Scientific Collaboration]], which now numbers more than 1000 collaborators worldwide to carry out the science.

The initial LIGO detectors reached design sensitivity and set many limits on astrophysical sources. The Advanced LIGO proposal was developed while Barish was director, and he has continued to play a leading role in LIGO and Advanced LIGO.  The [[First observation of gravitational waves|first detection of the merger of two 30 solar mass black holes]] was made on September 14, 2015.<ref>[https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102#fulltext  Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger], PhysRevLett.116.061102.</ref> This represented the first direct detection of gravitational waves since they were predicted by Einstein in 1916 and the first ever observation of the merger of a pair of black holes. Barish delivered the first presentation on this discovery to a scientific audience at CERN on February 11, 2016,<ref>{{cite web|title=New results on the Search for Gravitational Waves|url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/2131411|publisher=CERN|access-date=October 15, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012101755/https://cds.cern.ch/record/2131411|archive-date=October 12, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> simultaneously with the public announcement.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://cds.cern.ch/record/2131411|title=New results on the Search for Gravitational Waves|date=February 11, 2016|access-date=October 3, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012101755/https://cds.cern.ch/record/2131411|archive-date=October 12, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

From 2001 to 2002, Barish served as co-chair of the [[High Energy Physics Advisory Panel]] subpanel that developed a long-range plan<ref>{{cite web|title=Subpanel on Long Range Planning for US HEP|url=http://science.energy.gov/~/media/hep/pdf/files/pdfs/hepap_lrp_web.pdf|publisher=Office of Science}}</ref> for U.S. high energy physics. He has chaired the Commission of Particles and Fields and the U.S. Liaison committee to the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]] (IUPAP). In 2002, he chaired the NRC Board of Physics and Astronomy Neutrino Facilities Assessment Committee Report, "Neutrinos and Beyond".

From 2005 to 2013, Barish was Director of the [[Global Design Effort]]<ref>{{cite web|title=ILC Global Design Effort|url=http://www.linearcollider.org/GDE|publisher=LinearCollider.org|access-date=2013-02-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213030522/http://www.linearcollider.org/GDE|archive-date=2013-02-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> for the International Linear Collider ([[International Linear Collider|ILC]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Barry Barish to lead International Linear Collider design.|url=http://www.interactions.org/cms/?pid=1018952|publisher=Interactions.org}}</ref>  The ILC is the highest priority future project for particle physics worldwide, as it promises to complement the [[Large Hadron Collider]] at [[CERN]] in exploring the TeV energy scale.  This ambitious effort is being uniquely coordinated worldwide, representing a major step in international collaborations going from conception to design to implementation for large scale projects in physics.

==Honors and awards==
In 2002, he received the [[Klopsteg Memorial Award]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aapt.org/Programs/awards/klopsteg.cfm|title=Klopsteg Memorial Lecture Award|date=2017|publisher=American Association of Physics Teachers|access-date=December 14, 2017}}</ref> of the American Association of Physics Teachers.
